{"text":"It is just so sad that female girl groups do not have it when it does come down to voices from the heart. Girl groups used to have it, but instead have only wasted their talent after awhile. When I had heard that another girl group has came out to try and deliver, I was honestly very skeptical to hear if there was better than what others have not been able to do. Fifth Harmony has only been out for only a few years, but honestly I really didn't find them to really ignite. When I had heard their breakout single, Worth It, I honestly didn't find the song to really impress me, the way that other girl groups have been able to deliver like Salt N' Pepa or En Vogue had shown before. Honestly, the song does have some rhythm and isn't bad, but honestly there really isn't any chemistry between the girls and what the song could have really been voice, heart and all. I really hope there is a better tone from Fifth Harmony, something more worth it.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"The current music landscape has seen a number of compelling new albums from the likes of Dave Matthews Band, The Killers, and Muse.  Unfortunately, The Wallflowers were not able to join this group.  While Glad All Over is not a bad album, there isn't much that vies for attention.  I don't know if it was the decision to work with Mick Jones of the Clash or something bigger, but this just doesn't seem like The Wallflowers to me.  I thought the best two songs on the album were the urgent \"It's A Dream\" and the rather subdued \"Love Is A Country\".  However neither of these really stands up to previous albums by The Wallflowers or even Jakob Dylan's solo work either.  You may or may not agree.  However, if you are still on the fence about this album, I'll put it to you in simple terms.  If you like the first single \"Reboot The Mission\" or \"Misfits And Lovers\", you'll probably like Glad All Over.  If you don't, you'll probably want to pass.  It's not that the music is bad per se, but it does little to grab my attention and fight to keep it.\n\nDownload this:  It's A Dream","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":9}

Instead of the thinly structured synth-pop of the two follow-ups to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Speak-Spell\/dp\/B000ESSTKQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Speak & Spell<\/a>, \"Some Great Reward\" took the plunge into the heart of darkness. They'd gotten caught up with technology, giving the sound a fuller feel, and the lyrical content became more mature and cynical. The Dominance\/Submission roleplay of \"Master and Servant\" (which was the second single) and the sociological blast of \"Blasphemous Rumours\" picked and cut deeper than before.\n\nThis was also the album that made Depeche Mode in the states. \"People Are People\" got into the American Top 20, and according the liner notes by producer Daniel Miller, the first thing recorded for the album. Egalitarian in tone, DM apparently even tried to darken the sound of the song lest it be construed as too pop. Those three particular songs make \"Some Great Reward\" on a par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Violator\/dp\/B000ESSTL0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Violator<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Black-Celebration\/dp\/B000002L9M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Celebration<\/a>&nbsp;for consistency.\n\nLike all the reissued back catalog of Depeche Mode, the 5.1 remix of the bonus disc is terrific. It fills the room with both the arena ready music that the Mode was growing into, but emphasizes the industrial samples the band was adding to the music. The clanging metal and factory wheezing leaps from the mix and shows just how ahead of the curve the band was. As for the mini-movie, \"You can get away with anything...\" chronicles the band working on the LP. I doubt I'll watch it more than twice. A pair of B-Sides and a remix of the lovely \"Somebody\" round out the package.\n\nGiven that Depeche Mode would next reach their emotionally darkest music by the next CD and then blast to superstardom (\"Black Celebration,\"&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Music-for-the-Masses\/dp\/B000002LCI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Music for the Masses<\/a>), this is the CD where you can here it drop into high gear.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWhile a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE \/ CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5,"fold":9}

The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably, KEM!!\n\nI love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs, namely: LOVE CALLS, MATTER OF TIME, SAY & YOU ARE.\nYes, it is more of a \"chill out\" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production.

{"text":"One of the great rock classics, (Don't Fear) The Reaper was a big hit in late 1976 for hard rock band Blue Oyster Cult, a band that generally had big album sales from their FM fan base. But this song was so special it broke out into an AM singles hit. It was very toned down for Blue Oyster Cult but that's what made it work. For all it's theme of death it's not angry or hysterical but rather uses a mellow, almost folk-like vocal by Buck Dharma (who wrote the song) along with tightly harmonized backup vocals and guitar to carry it's ultimately positive message of accepting the inevitability of The Reaper. Everything is restrained until the wonderfully explosive guitar interlude about two and a half minutes in. The band's engineers created an echoing acoustic for the instruments that also serves the song well.\n\nAll in all a melodic and memorable hit. Oh yeah, it's also got that cowbell!","classification":5,"fold":9}

Honest without sacrificing the message of Christ. The album is diverse in songs, though primarily targeted for the inner city. His imagery is clear enough so that if you didn't grow up in the hood you'll be gripped. He's versatile, crunk, laid back, romance, the struggle, repentance and deliverance are all covered.

Musically, he had been absent from making new music for quite awhile, and a few years ago, he did make a splash again, teaming up again with his old prodigy, the great Toni Braxton on their Love, Marriage & Divorce album. The album was pretty good, but sadly did not do very well in regards in sales. Now, he is set to try it again on his own, after being absent from making music on his own. His latest song We've Got Love, is not actually one of his better songs. Instead, the song feels very weak from the heart. I found this track, to ignite less than the classic balladry he had been known for for songs he had like When Can I See You Again, and songs he had written for Toni, as well as Whitney Houston, and others.

{"text":"When Grizzly Bear released \"Veckatimest\" in 2009, the band deserved the critical and commercial breakthrough it brought them. I personally loved that album and had it in my Top 10 of Albums of the Year then. The band took to the road with that album like never before, and then took time off for various side projects (including the \"Blue Valentine\" soundtrack). Now a long three years later comes Grizzly Bear's 4th studio album (not counting \"Blue Valentine\").\n\n\"Shields\" (10 tracks; 48 min.) starts off with the acoustic guitar-heavy \"Sleeping Ute\" and then dives into \"Speak In Rounds\", which I believe is the hardest rocking track Grizzly Bear has ever done. After a 1 min. instrumental interlude, we then get \"Yet Again\", which yet again shows the band at its hardest rocking, wow. The album's first half closes with a pensive \"The Hunt\". I rate the first half of the album 4.5 stars. The second half starts off with the gently trotting \"A Simple Answer\", which is followed buy an abstract sounding \"What's Wrong?\". The songs on Side B are all quite long, and not as immediately attention-grabbing as earlier in the album. \"Gun-Shy\" reminded me of 1970s Steely Dan, for some reason! It all leads to the closing track, a 7 min. \"Sun In Your Eyes\", which feels like it could and should go epic, and then finally does. I rate the album's second half 3.5 stars.\n\nIn all, while not as impressive as \"Veckatimest\", \"Shields\" is still a very good album, and certainly worth the long wait. I've seen the band in concert a number of times over the years, including most recently at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, where they headlined and brought a fantastic 80 min. set that relied heavily on songs from \"Shields\" (I think they all-but-one from the album), confirming once again that any song Grizzly Bear plays live, rocks much harder in concert than on the studio albums. If you have a chance to see these guys in concert, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \"Shields\" is highly recommended!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"In their seventies heyday, Earth Wind and Fire were one of the hottest touring acts in the world and an unstoppable singles machine. Band leader Maurice White and main singer Phillip Bailey had a chemistry that was almost unbeatable, and top notch musicians brought the chops. White eventually hit a supple groove that was both funky and popular, and when the hits started coming, like \"Shining Star\" and \"September,\" they helped make disco into a bit less of a dirty word.\n\nThey had another secret weapon in the EWF Horns. Punchy when they needed to be, smooth jazz when required, they often provided an 'x' factor in the band's best work. The band mixed these elements into a dynamite stage show that rivaled George Clinton's Mothership era for sheer audacity and showmanship. While there are no live tracks here, if you've ever seen the camp classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band\/dp\/B00009APB6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<\/a>, you'll see a tiny fraction of the excitement when the band performs \"Got To Get You Into My Life.\"\n\nListening to this CD several years after what EWF tunes had been trimmed from my library is a real trip down memory lane. From the opening Black Pride Themed \"Shining Star\" to the road-trip classic \"Getaway,\" these are all memorable hook-fests that livened up many an AM radio in the 70's. White often had a Utopian vision that he emphasized in his lyrics making these tunes both danceable and uplifting. Bailey's distinguished falsetto livened the ballads (like \"After The Love Has Gone\"), but EWF's real genius was making songs that were irresistible funky grooves. If you don't find yourself bopping to \"Boogie Wonderland,\" check and make sure your feet are still attached.\n\nOnly frustration - missing \"Love's Holiday,\" \"Magnetic,\" \"System of Survival\" or anything post 1983. Could have been a double disc, easily. But really, even without them, this single disc EWF CD is indispensable if you're an oldies buff.","classification":5,"fold":9}

He couldn't believe it, so I pointed to the title of what was playing. I guess those music recognition programs don't always include baroque music. It was humorous.\n\n(If you do decide to go canoeing and camping in Noel MO, be sure to visit this quaint caf next door to the post office.","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"Working full-time gigs at record stores for nine years meant hearing a lot of music I wouldn't have otherwise spent any time with. I've kept up with indie music (or college rock, or whatever you want to call it) pretty well since the late mid- to late-90s, so I never needed much help there. Typically, it was pop, soul and pop rock music that my always diverse batch of co-workers often exposed me to. Everything from U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind, which I heard about fourteen thousand times in late months of 2000, to Avril Lavigne's Under My Skin, a record I even ended up buying at some point. Nowadays, it's the lonely late hours of the night that usually prompt me to look into artists I wouldn't other check out. I screen the new releases on iTunes, listening to as many samples as I can. Most of what I hear, of course, is very much not for me. But, from time to time, I'll be really surprised by how good a Miley Cyrus or P!nk or Katy Perry song is. My most recent surprise find just happens to be, as I type this sentence, the by-far most popular record on the planet - Taylor Swift's fourth proper studio album, Red. I'd heard the record's lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" a number of times, here and there, floating around in popular society's dying common spaces. A good pop song, I thought, not realizing that it was the work of that goofy, skinny, super young country singer who serial dates celebrities and acts super phony every time a camera is pointed at her. It never occurred to me that it could be Swift - an artist I knew to be a bland product of the modern pop-country machine. This was a pop song. A cheesy one, but a good one, with great production, an incredible hook and brilliant production.\n\nThe samples I eventually heard on iTunes were at-times interesting, but it took hearing the album's most recent single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" to convince me to really look into Swift and her new record. What I found was a pretty solid pop disc that had few traces of any sounds I relate to the country genre (through further investigation I learned that Red is a departure from Swift's past records, which are full of generic mod-pop-country). So yes, finally, I bought a copy of Red. Of the album's 16 tracks I genuinely enjoy six - quite a bit, even. The by-far best offering remains, I think, the above mentioned \"Trouble,\"  a synth-heavy production that feels, to me at least, oddly hip. It's an indie synth pop track that could be played alongside Fun or even Gorillaz, the difference being that Swift songs - I hate to admit - really do have notably stellar vocals. Other great cuts include opener \"State of Grace\" (which, oddly enough, sounds like Swift singing over an early naughts U2 composition), \"Stay Stay Stay\" (a cutesy indie pop song that will absolutely be in a television commercial soon enough), the aforementioned \"We Are Never\" (another big snyth-pop production with a massive hook), \"The Last Time\" (a singer\/songwriter collaboration with Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody that, no jokin', could've easily been on the Once soundtrack) and \"The Lucky One,\" an epic swell of a production that borders on being too cheesy.\n\nBut here's the thing about this review: I'm unusually picky about pop music. Chances are, if you like Taylor Swift - or commercial pop music, or pretty much any of the songs I've discussed in this review - there's a very good chance you'll like most of Red. I recognize that the title track is a big winner, as are second single \"Begin Again,\" pop-fest \"22\" and Ed Sheeran collaboration \"Everything Has Changed.\" I just don't personally happen to like these songs a whole lot ... yet. What I'm saying is this: Taylor Swift, against all odds, has made a pretty damn impressive pop record. Working with producers like Butch Walker (Avril Lavigne, Weezer, Katy Perry, Pete Yorn), Dan Wilson (Mike Doughty, Adele), Jackknife Lee (U2, R.E.M., Weezer, Bloc Party), and Kanye West's secret weapon, Jeff Bhasker (Bruno Mars, Alicia Keys, Fun, Drake, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Lana Del Rey, etc.) doesn't hurt. Nor does being able to sing as well as Swift surely can. Yeah, the record's themes - a 20-something girl growing up, trying new things, falling in and out of relationships - isn't relatable to me, but that's what all the massive hooks and interesting production is for. I never thought I'd say this but, sure, I like some Taylor Swift songs. A whole lot, even. That said, when I listen through the Swift back catalog I dislike just about everything I hear; Red, though ... well, for what it is, it's pretty damn impressive.\n\nRead more of my music and film writing at ZeCatalist.com.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Harrison's \"I Need You\" follows right behind with its plaintive lyrics; HELP really is an emotional collection (By the time you get to \"Yesterday\" you realize \"regret\" is the theme to this recording.

And Ringo Starr released  \"It Don't Come Easy\", (a George Harrison Song) in 1971. There are the original versions of George Harrison doing this song earlier as a \"guide\" for Ringo. .  Being a Beatle Freak, I heard the song on the radio, then George Harrisons guitar break (CLASSIC) and was hooked. Ringo's second single (Beaucoups of Blues being the regrettable first) it was a top 5 hit here in the US. How many groups after splitting up can say all the members had a top 5 hit the following year? The song itself had an all star band, (Klaus Voormann on bass guitar, Stephen Stills on piano, Badfinger members on background vocals), This song is a classic, hard driving , and has a \"spectorish\" production but George Martin the prime influence, at Abbey Road Studios.

{"text":"It is so sad that Elton Joh  is set to retire from making new music, after 50 years as a mainstay, and one of the most universal and influential artists to have ever graced the stage. He has had so many highs  and achievements that no singer will ever replicate & lows that could've derailed his life & career. But through it all, his legacy will always be beyond the yellow brick road. He has had so many bountiful generations come to him, and why he is still standing strong, where others like Michael Jackson & Prince died so young. You can listen to any of Elton's songs, and they still sound better than what is on radio right now. But nevertheless, the one album many people will always go to is his 1973 double-album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which bridged so many divides in the music industry. The title track, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just very timeless to listen to, produced by the dear Gus Dudgeon, as a timeless portrait of what a musician's soul is like when he finally meets his future and runs with it for a new light at the end of the tunnel.

{"text":"Rap royalty and neo-soul star power come together on the fine&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wake-Up\/dp\/B003TXKSWK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wake Up!<\/a>, a covers album by The Roots and John Legend.  While 'Wake Up!' doesn't \"reinvent the wheel\" by any means, it is an enjoyable and soulful listen, finding both the Roots and Legend at their best.  While the Roots rap contributions are modest here, that is smart considering the tone and the scope of this album.  John Legend sounds among his most soulful ever here, particularly on the best cuts.  There are moments that sag just the slightest bit, but the dynamic moments easily mask the sagging ones.\n\n\"Compared to What\" opens the album superbly with atmospheric retro-soul production work that possesses an organic quality.  The extended instrumental opening simmers for over a minuter until Legend's soulful vocals enter.  While \"Compared to What\" is lengthy, it is quite enjoyable, accentuated even more by the soulful use of organ, trumpet, and saxophone.  \"Hard Times,\" similarly, doesn't miss a beat, again beginning with a dramatic opening and the incorporation of a tasteful rap verse.  \"Little Ghetto  Boy\" opens with a rap, incorporating The Roots' prodigious rap talents, something that is only subtly appears throughout this album.  The piano work here by Legend is spot on.\n\n\"Wake Up Everybody\" features fine guest spots by Common and Melanie Fiona. Here, the super collaborative team do a fine job of recreating the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic with some sense of justice.  Similarly, \"Our Generation\" shines finding Legend channelling his gospel roots - particularly on the out-tro section (\"Atlanta...come on Lagos, lets straighten out...) \"Humanity (Love the Way It Should Be)\" incorporates reggae and works, though it isn't as \"epic\" as say \"Compared to What\" or \"Hard Times\" or \"Wake Up Everybody.\"  \"Hang On in There\" is solid, featuring low-key production work that shimmers.  It is \"I Can't Write Left Handed\" though that redirects the energy of the album back to the level set early on.  Here, the production work is easily the best of the album and The Roots and Legend truly let loose. Sure, it's over eleven minutes in length, but once you hear it, you will instantly note it is the very best cut of the album.\n\n\"Wholy Holy\" features understated production work (compared to the overt nature of \"I Can't Write Left Handed\").  Here, Legend sounds best as he channels the gospel elements of his voice as far as nuances, phrasing, etc.  \"I Wish I Know How It Would Feel to Be Free\" one-ups \"Wholy Holy\" cranking up the tempo and finds the super-band all but performing in the church.  The gospel element here is inescapable and one just wishes the cut were longer than its brief duration.  \"Shine,\" the only original (penned by Legend) is typical Legend songwriting and closes the album strongly, though not say revolutionarily.\n\nAs far as the production work and concept,' Wake Up!' is easily the year's most unique R&B album.  The performances are enjoyable, but maybe more enjoyable and awe-inspiring is the atmosphere of the album - the music sounds like it came from the 60's and 70's.  As far as the content, this is a solid (actually better than solid) album, but the lengthiness of the tracks and the occasional \"over-indulgence\" sometimes wears on a bit too long.  With that said, there isn't that much to quibble about here; the Roots and Legend do a much better job than most people do making cover albums.  Exceptional effort overall in my eyes.  4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of JCM because his gravelly, breathy voice never did anything for me, personally.  But he can't do anything about that - it's his voice.  When you have a feature that unique, some people just aren't going to like it.  However, that doesn't detract from his song writing ability, a talent he clearly possesses.  Hurt's So Good is a song with catchy guitar riffs, excellent production, and an 80's era rock sound that is unmistakable.  This is a great song everyone should have in their library.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Cher's new CD masters what \"Believe\" promised in 1998.  Cher's singing is confident and powerful; and the songs are consistently excellent.  This CD follows Cher's 2000 internet-only CD of self-penned tunes, \"not.commercial,\" that Cher released on her own Isis label.  For that CD, she lived in a castle in France and wrote some good songs like \"The Fall\" dedicated to Kurt Cobain and \"Sisters of Mercy\" that expressed her opinions on Catholic school.  While we don't see any saucy lyrics as Cher's classic, \"You're about as useless as Bob Dole's... arm,\" we do get the best commercial polish on \"Living Proof.\"\n\"Song for the Lonely\" is a hot rocker, timely in the wake of the World Trade Towers & Pentagon terrorist acts, \"When heroes fall in love or war, they live forever.\"  The drums fall hard on this comforting opener; and when Cher sings \"It'll be all right,\" her vocals fly angelically.  \"A Different Kind of Love Song\" is a cosmic rocker with a driving techno beat, \"We have living proof there's some kind of light that flows through everything.\"  \"Alive Again\" is a pulsating midtempo song of renewal, \"I only want to learn to freeze the flame.\"  Throbbing echo chamber vocals resound through the excellent \"The Music's No Good Without You.\"  One of my favorite tracks, #1 on my own personal top ten, is \"Rain Rain,\" an addictive soulful track.  Keyboards and hot rhythm guitar lace \"Real Love,\" \"Time after time, you're bringing me up when I'm down.\"  \"Love So High\" has more soaring vocals on this throbbing rocker.  \"Body to Body Heart to Heart\" is an amorous full-throated rocker where Cher uses a taste of Spanish guitar that she employed so prominently on one of my favorite songs from the \"not.commercial\" CD, the gorgeous ballad \"Still.\"  \"I'll never love this way again,\" Cher sings passionately as the pace slows a tad on the beautiful \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You.\"  \"Love One Another\" is great cosmic pop with pulsing rhythms, \"Try to understand, open up your heart, a fist is just a hand, it can come apart.\"  Keyboards wash defiantly on \"When You Walk Away.\"  The CD closes with Bruce Roberts' and Donna Weiss' \"When the Money's Gone,\" a funky rocker that is so endearing.  Cher's voice floats as she sings, \"What a fine life I give to you.\"\n\"Living Proof\" is musically excellent.  Cher has fully moved into the genre.  We sense the woman behind the production.  She fashions some beautiful cosmic truths as well as just singing her heart out.  This CD is a VERY good time!  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":9}

The beat is kinda hard so it takes some getting used to considering Brandy's music is generally softer-sounding. But you can dance to this song and it's for the clubs so I can appreciate the change. I don't really know what it was about today that made me like this song but I think it's also the first time I heard the version with Chris Brown in it unless the standard version has him in it anyway.\n\nMy favorite part is probably the bridge though cause Brandy reveals herself a bit in it. I also like the video because in a certain scene, Brandy is back to rockin' the braids she used to back in the day. Loved that and it took me back.\n\n4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I tried to give Rick the benefit of the doubt here, but his selection of covers needed more consideration. I mean, most of the songs are ballads, and he does not improve upon the originals. I liked this album, but that's about it. I do not understand why Rick chose to remake songs almost identical to their originals. I really did not enjoy his version of The Dream Academy's \"Life In A Northern Town\" or Foreigner's \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\". I did not understand why he got Richard Page of Mr. Mister to redo \"Broken Wings\". I mean, why get the vocalist of the song to do the song again? His version of Human League's \"Human\" also failed. However, there was something likeable about his version of The Church's \"Under The Milky Way\" and John Lennon's \"Imagine\". The only original song, \"Cry\", cannot hold a candle to the other classics on the disc. Why is that Rick would do an album of covers not even two years after releasing his first album of original material in five years? All I can say is that I am glad he got this out of the way so he can move on to better things.","classification":3,"fold":9}

It is hard to categorize the style of the music as Farish has come up with his unique presentation, but if forced to pidgeon-hole the presentation, you could say it is easy listening yet in no way sappy (sort of mellowed out Tangerince Dream) -- it is just spacey enough to create  wonderfully dreamy landscapes or to play as relaxing background music.

Highly energized RNB covers such as BOBBY DAY's OVER & OVER, CHRIS KENNER'S I LIKE IT LIKE THAT, and THE CONTOURS' DO YOU LOVE ME mingled alongside rowdy, cock-sure band originals GLAD ALL OVER, ANY WAY YOU WANT IT, and BITS & PIECES, all earmarked by lead singer MIKE SMITH's ferocious howl and the group's beat-heavy stomp 'n whomp sound. Among the non-smashes here are GOOD OLD ROCK & ROLL MEDLEY, the same set of fifties classics that CAT MOTHER & THE ALL NIGHT NEWSBOYS had a smash with, and a decent cover of NA NA HEY HEY KISS HIM GOODBYE by one hit wonder STEAM.

{"text":"Aesop Rock, the man with the largest vocabulary in hip hop (or so states New York data scientist Matt Daniels), has returned with emcee Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz (who combined make up the group Hail Mary Mallon) for Bestiary, the trio's second LP. Released by Rhymesayers Entertainment, the same label that released HHM's first LP, Are You Gonna Eat That?, Bestiary contains a more digestible form of its fore- album's bizarre, complex lyricism of wacky, oddball imagery and situations. Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are unruly, aimless badasses, rapping all over the place and in all directions. With their ill rhyme styles, they explore the nature and philosophy of life and death, and their wild, artful rapping accurately mimics the chaos of the world. Taking its name from the word meaning a written account of real and fantasy animals, Bestiary contains some animal imagery but just lots of other imagery too, like art gallery-scale imagery. Despite all the craziness and a few dark undertones, there is a sense of purpose, hope and levity in Bestiary thanks to the \"fund raiser concert\" skits and their do-it-yourself subtext. Coupled with the intelligent, left field lyrics, the samples, scratches, diverse synths and hard rocking drums make Bestiary a truly eccentric specimen of underground, alternative hip hop. It marks a new level of comfort for Hail Mary Mallon that just might prove comforting to audiences as well.","classification":3,"fold":9}

Besides Rehab, my favourite track is called Love Is A Losing Game, a gem of a song in the lost love tradition with a beautiful melody. Another great one is You Know I'm No Good with its powerful sax. And Me & Mr Jones is a stunner. The music gains a distinctive flavour through the use of samples from classic 1960s pop songs, while the lyrics are intelligent and mature. There is a certain authenticity to this seamless blend of funk, torch, R&B and pop music that reaches the heart and soul. And it's rare to find an album these days where every single track is memorable; Back To Black has thus been a very pleasant surprize. I am sure Winehouse wil prove to be a major talent in the years to come, judging by this excellent CD.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Who doesn't already know the charming story of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, the creative (and for a while, romantic) couple who acted and performed in that indie film gem from Ireland, \"Once\"?  It was a bit of an underdog triumph when they won the \"Best Song\" Oscar last year for \"Falling Slowly\", arguably the best romantic ballad of the decade.  Now they follow up that success with a new album under their collective name, The Swell Season.  It's a more polished affair than either their debut album or the \"Once\" soundtrack, but it's also much more cohesive.  You won't hear Hansard's raw, shouting vocals that punctuated the songs from \"Once\", but that's not a problem.  This is definitely a mellower affair, and the songwriting is every bit as strong and more mature. It's not as cathartic as some of the songs from \"Once\", but it's still quietly moving.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Battle Studies, to its defense, followed the Grammy-winning juggernaut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Continuum\/dp\/B000H0MKGK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Continuum<\/a>, arguably Mayer's `crowning achievement.'  Born and Raised has less pressure than Mayer's previous effort and ends being a stronger effort, comprised of solid songwriting with well crafted, thoughtful production. Born and Raised won't deliver many if any additional chart topping singles (\"Shadow Days\" dented the charts), but it marks a solid addition to the Mayer discography.\n\n\"Queen of California\" opens Born and Raised brilliantly, instantly unveiling the folk-rock sentiment of the album.  The vocal production is superb here, and the vocal harmonizations soulful and beautiful.  The songwriting is top-notch, matching the quality of Mayer's previous album openers easily.  \"The Age of Worry\" follows \"Queen of California\" capably, opening with acoustic guitar and breaking into a folk-rock driven sound that reminds one of Bruce Springsteen (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wrecking-Ball\/dp\/B006ZCWTV0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wrecking Ball<\/a>).  Vocally Mayer sounds clear and polished and the ultra efficient length aids in making \"The Age of Worry\" another winner.  \"Shadow Days,\" the first single proceeds, featuring Greg Leisz on pedal steel (he also appeared on \"Queen of California\") aiding to the `roots' rock timbre.  The musicianship continues to allure even if \"Shadow Days\" does not captivate as much as the excellent opener.\n\n\"Speak For Me\" finds Mayer playing into an acoustic-based folk sound and delivering effortlessly.  The songwriting continues to impress and \"Speak\" is quite pleasant.  While it is path already tread by the singer\/songwriter, the cut stands out amongst the rest of the album as one of the best. That said, \"Something Like Olivia\" is arguably the album's best cut, adding some `grit' and extra excitability to Born and Raised.  That isn't to underwrite the folk-rock rumination of earlier cuts including \"Speak For Me,\" but \"Something Like Olivia\" shakes up the formula adding an extra dimension of soul, courtesy of vocal harmonizations and use of organ.  \"Something Like Olivia\" sounds organic and bluesy, not unlike Mayer's critically acclaimed effort Continuum.\n\nTitle track \"Born and Raised\" adds David Crosby and Graham Nash to the vocals, creating some stunning vocal harmonies with Mayer's lead.  The harmonic progression itself is solid and provides perfect underpinnings for the folk-rock cut.  The pace is relaxed which allows the title cut to breathe and impress.  \"If I Ever Get Around to Living\" is a bit long and lacks a bit of direction.  That said, the cut is pleasant and feels as natural as everything else.  \"Love is a Verb\" proceeds atoning with its two-and-a-half minute length. The sound is bluesy and lush, lyrics are simple yet `telling, and Mayer's vocals are clear and desirable.\n\n\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\" features jazz trumpeter Chris Botti.  Botti injects his smooth trumpet sound into the introduction, mixing with piano and rhythm guitar.  By the :40 mark, the groove solidifies.  \"Walt Grace\" features many positive facets including harmonized humming background vocals and solid songwriting.  The quibble might be that the cut is a bit `sleepy' despite being pleasant.  \"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\" has a slower pace with a country-folk feel.  Mayer's vocals are clear as a bell, though emotive enough to sell the cut.  Harmonica featured in tandem with rhythmic acoustic guitar and piano is a highlight.  The cut is a bit too static at times up until some punctuations by guitar around the 3:00 mark. \"A Face To Call Home\" features a more rock driven approach as the cut progresses, which contrasts the more folk aspects of Born & Raised.  Closing \"Born and Raised (Reprise)\" is a nice way to cap off a solid album.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Born-and-Raised\/dp\/B007MAETA8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Born and Raised<\/a>&nbsp;is a solid, well produced, and well written effort.  Born and Raised certainly has an elevated profile over Mayer's previous effort Battle Studies and even at times rivals the magic achieved by Mayer on Continuum.  Vocally, regardless of voice troubles, Mayer sounds top notch as if he never missed one beat.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I can't help but feel that Magma is one of their weaker albums, it's very average on the whole. And this is just in terms of the album as a stand alone work. It would be a bit unfair to compare it to their old material, even though I love those early albums. They brought some different sounds to the album overall but it's certainly toned down in terms of heaviness and technicality. And where as the previous album had strong tracks all around, Magma only has a few. Silvera is a highlight because it gives the album a much needed punch and succeeds in being hooky while also maintaining a fair bit of heaviness. Pray is a good representation of the atmospheric tone of this album, it's a good, haunting, and well crafted track. After that it gets a little bare bones in terms of highlights. Shooting Star, The Cell, Stranded, and Magma are all mildly decent songs, however they mostly kind of plod along and don't really go anywhere, save for the end of Stranded. I'm not seeing anything that great about any of them. And then there's Only Pain and Low Lands which I find forgettable and uninteresting. Yellow Stone and Liberation are short instrumentals that feel like tacked on ideas instead of fully composed pieces.\n\nI'm really not agreeing with the critical acclaim and rave reviews Magma has received. I guess I could say that at best it's an average diversion for the typical Gojira fan, or maybe it's just me not being able to really connect with the material. It's a very subjective review because if you're an older fan this simply might not do it for you. And on the other hand if you like the direction they've been heading in, you might love it. Either way though for me it's an underwhelming album that I don't really swing one way or the other with. It's not bad by any means, theres a couple pretty good songs here but I'm not feeling it as a whole. And it's actually kind of repetitive and lackluster. I think 3 stars out of 5 is a fair score for Magma.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era. In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him. He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit. Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list. With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement. Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute. Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute. And it is a virtuosic display. Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This song begins with a full orchestra playing a classical movie sound track. Drums enter along with an ominous bass synthesizer. It is punctuated by distant bird-like synthesized sounds, along with an odd, semi-guttural synthesized sound. I don't like the last sound as it seems distracting but it only lasts for a minute or less. The orchestra makes an occasional return. In the middle there is a melodic classical piano solo. The drums and bass synthesizers begin again with a return to the opening sequence which is a reprise of the first half. It ends with the return to the piano solo with faint violin triplets (possibly synthesized).\n\nOverall the song has a progressive feel with a bit of techno electronica pop overlay.","classification":5,"fold":9}

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"There is honestly a lot that I do love about Sam Smith. One thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul. He has balance where there has been a severe overexposure of flimsy singers like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. They have not had strong songs, and instead felt more pathetic and products than people at all. I liked a lot of his songs from the beginning because they are heartfelt, and definitely sincere. He showed it at the beginning with Stay With Me last year, and it has been continuing for him very nicely His latest song, Writing's On The Wall, actually works very nicely into his heart. At first when I had heard the song, it felt like hearing the theme to a James Bond film. But honestly, it works very nicely for him at the heart of his voice. Sam definitely has shown no sign of faltering down, and I recommend this song for your music library.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":9}

Not sure if I feel like going to a hoedown, or square dancing, but its definitely toe tapping. The rhythmic beat cant help but pull you in, moreso than \"Hey Brother\".  The Lyrics just get me mine wandering and thinking about bigger\/grander things.  For me, thats a good thing.  But for the most important question, would I put it on my MP3 player?\n\nBig question, does it pass the MP3 test (would I put it on my MP3 used for running)\nYes.  its on there.\n\nWhy 5 stars?

She tried so hard and was so diligent and serious.  And the risks she took!  Sure she could have sung opera or inspirational music, and got laughed at far less (actually probably ignored) - - but whether or not her recording career was a joke on HER, the fact that she accepted the challenge to record such unlikely (then) pop and rock and roll material is what made her GREAT.\n\nIn the end, Mrs. Miller was definitely the ED WOOD of vocal-dome period.

{"text":"This is a great collection of the music of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, which shows the complexity and depth of his compositions.\n\nMendelssohn's music can still suffer from a reputation of superficiality. Most of this can be traced back to the anti-Semitic ravings of Richard Wagner, who made Mendelssohn a prime case in point in his pamphlet \"Das Judenthum in der Musik\" (Jewishness in Music). Wagner wrote that Mendelssohn's music is \"sweet and tinkling without depth\". This became practically official goverment policy in Germany under the Nazis -- one of the first actions at the Berlin Philharmonic after the Nazis came to power was to take down Mendelssohn's picture from the concert hall.\n\nWagner's views took hold in England, and thus indirectly in the US as well, through critics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially George Bernard Shaw. Shaw was the author of \"The Perfect Wagnerite\" and an unabashed Wagner aficionado. He criticized Mendelssohn's \"conventional sentimentality\". Mendelssohn was eventually linked in the public consciousness with the values and culture of the Victorian era, and thus suffered neglect when those values were outgrown.\n\nEven after World War II, Mendelssohn was rather on the fringe rather than the core of performance in most of Germany, except perhaps in Leipzig, where he was remembered as former conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra and founder of the music conservatory.\n\nThe result of all this is that a few key pieces, like the Overture and Wedding March from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and the Violin Concerto, have become overplayed staples, while others works were often second-string concert fillers. His chamber works are performed quite a bit, but these draw smaller crowds than symphonies.\n\nBut I think one of the reasons criticisms of Mendelssohn gained so much traction is that there is a kernel of oversimplified truth to them. Mendelssohn's music is indeed fairly upbeat a lot of the time. Today we would call it \"accessible\", which can be a dirty word in many circles. He was certainly not a brooding musical soul, pouring out his pathos like a Mahler, or a musical ideologue like Wagner. His music is easy to like and easy to listen to. But you can say the same of Mozart.\n\nDespite all this, the compositions in this collection show, starting out with the first track (\"The Hebrides\"), that Mendelssohn really was a composer of depth with tremendous ability and a broad emotional palette -- including a good dose of melancholy, if not pathos. Check out the 5th Symphony, or the 1st. Or the concertos for one or two pianos. Or any number of chamber works, such as Piano Trio No. 1, early String Symphonies, or the sonatas. There is emotional range and depth to burn.\n\nThe orchestral works are perhaps the heart of the set, with all but one of Mendelssohn's five symphonies included. Except for two symphonies performed by the Bamberg symphony Orchestra under Austrian conductor Han Swarowsky, they are by different orchestras and conductors. I really enjoyed the 1st Symphony performed by the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra under Maxim Shostakovich (Dmitri's son). The omnipresent Violin Concerto is performed ably by soloist Jaime Laredo and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and the lesser-known Concerto for Violin and Strings is also here. There are good performances of both Piano Concertos as well as both Concertos for Two Pianos. Only the double concerto for piano and violin is missing among the concertos.\n\nThe set has a broad and satisfying selection of chamber music, including the Clarinet Sonata, the two excellent String Quintets, Piano Trio No. 1, the 1838 Violin Sonata, and two of the 12 String Symphonies he wrote as a child. There is also a nice selection of organ music, with the Three Preludes and Fugues for Organ, and two of his six Organ Sonatas.\n\nThe parts of Mendelssohn's work that appear underrepresented are sacred and choral works, and songs. Psalm 42 is included in its entirety, and selections from \"Three Psalms\" and \"Sechs Spr&uuml;che\" for Choir. These offer a glimpse into this part of Mendelssohn's work. But as with all these collections, it is always possible to argue about what is included and what is left out -- there is no way to satisfy everybody.\n\nThe performances, as with most of the collections by X5 in its \"Most Essential\" series, are first rate, but are generally not by the most famous names. I have listened to extended samples from all the works here, and was impressed by the overall performance quality.\n\nBitrates vary from 184 to 247 Kbps, with most in the 220s or 230s. Only two tracks are below 200 Kbps. I haven't come across any disappointing encoding artifacts or distortion so far -- quality seems good from a technical standpoint too. Total download size is a humongous 1.08 GB.\n\nOverall, this is a great collection of excellent music by a composer that deserves a lot more credit and attention than history has given him. Highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"It has been a very long time since we've heard anything from Maxwell musically and personally. After 2009's Blacksummers' Night album, many welcomes his soulful voice and swooning heart brilliantly. Nevertheless, many have welcomed him back and awaited to see what he would sincerely conjure up with next, as he promised to make a trio of albums. Well, now with his similar titled album blackSummers' Night coming out soon, many in soul and R&B have waited for him to swoon all over again. His returning single is absolutely no exception that he has not lost what he had shown musically for years. Lake By The Ocean is a more upbeat and soulful song that still brought out the best of his voice and charming sophistication in music. Maxwell delivers a lot of heart into his work nicely, and this song flows well with a lot of the songs he had released for the past several years like Fistful Of Tears and Pretty Wings. It is a very upbeat song that takes your breath away. I recommend this song for any die hard Maxwell fan, and a nice listen to for any die hard fan of neo-soul and R&B.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"First, I don't listen to too much rap\/hip-hop\/whatever. Mostly because I can't get too excited about the raps (too much repetitive boasting with a limited vocabulary), but also because the performers seem to take themselves way too seriously.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is some timeless music in the genre, and the highest profile rappers are genuine pop stars. For perspective, I continue to like Jay-Z, Kanye West, Blackalicious, Eminem, Fat Lip, Cypress Hill, De La Soul, Eric B & Rakim, and more. For my money, these are smart artists with a sense of humor (well, maybe Cypress Hill is just fun).\n\nWith all that in mind, I have to say that Lil Wayne may be the king of the hill. Like many many people, I've been following him through the unofficial mix tapes (\"I Feel Like Dying\" is genius). This recording is the work of an artist at the top of his technique, with creativity and imagination overflowing. I won't begin to describe the wordplay, other than to say Lil Wayne throws away phrases that lessor artists would put in their hook. This is the work of someone who clearly loves words.\n\nIf you only listen to this one time, it will be worth the cost!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"In 2013, Stryper made a huge statement with No More Hell To Pay  no longer would they be content to wallow in the mediocre world of popular rock. That collection of original rockers resonated with the history of this band, their sound and their mission  to rock the hell out of you! The fans loved and embraced it, but when queried via social media, requested heavier and louder. So in response the band delivered Fallen, which is in essence, the perfect sequel to No More Hell To Pay. Many of these songs are indeed bold, riff-heavy, filled with shred and, yes with a few exceptions (Love You Like I Do and All Over Again) they even rock just a bit harder. One aspect that really jumped out of the speakers at me was how absolutely perfect the huge punchy bass drum sound projects  that live kick that literally thumps the heart  and also how the mix really has a metal edge. As a band these guys are gelling in every aspect and that is certainly exciting to see at this later stage of their career. Too many highlights here, but the first 3 tracks, Heaven, Let There Be Light, and King of Kings really do it for me, as does the cover of Sabbaths After Forever.\n\nLyrically Stryper is delivering the same message\/good news that theyve been singing about since their buzz saw guitars first carved out their niche in the Hollywood metal scene over 30 years ago   and they do it with a humble conviction and sincerity that is unrivaled. I have to say, though, that Im a bit cautious of those touting this as the best and most important Stryper release ever. The enthusiasm over this release is without a doubt well-earned but a classic is defined by more than just a great start out of the gates and only time will tell how well these songs hold up. Consider how many lives an album like Soldiers Under Command or To Hell With the Devil have impacted? Still, there is no denying the positive push Fallen generates. Those who have been ardent fans since the beginning can take comfort in knowing that not only is Stryper committed to the metal cause and to their fans, but most importantly, they are still following their calling.\n\nCan't wait to get my white vinyl version next month!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Hmmm. Where to start. In my opinion if you're a die-hard fan that likes the Call of the Mastodon, Leviathan, Remission era sound then this album will be a shock to you. It certainly falls in the Hunter footsteps of them becoming more accessible and radio-friendly with each release. There are zero growling vocals everything sounds almost a higher pitch type of singing and Brann;s drumming is impeccable as always but lacks that craziness he is known for. Very straightforward beats in the Mastodon realm. There is no crazy parts like in \"the Last Baron\" of \"welcoming war\" . I agree with the other reviewers comment about the 'cheerleader' type of back vox on the 8th track. Not what you're used to hearing from mastodon and in my opinion it didn't exactly work.\nI liked the 2nd and 9th tracks, the rest is somewhat unremarkable. That first single \"high road\" is a great example of what to expect from the entire album. For some reason I keep thinking to myself that this is comparable to Metallica \"black album\" in the aspect of what you hear isn't exactly bad but it isn't what you wanted from your fave band that used to thrash and speed like no one else.\nMaybe Mastodon, Warner bros and the producer all want to change the fan base a bit and get some new blood instead of old.\nAn overall basic affair in my book.

{"text":"Neither of Lenny's first two post millennium releases said anything all that new about his artistry. By the time the 2000's were nearly a decade old however Lenny was beginning to make a change. He decamped to New Orleans and recorded this,what wound up being his final Virgin album after two decades on the label. He also produced some songs on Labelle's reunion album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Back-to-Now\/dp\/B001E2PTIG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back to Now<\/a>. This showcases he was developing the same interest in the music of the Crescent City that inspired many rock stars of the past to develop their sound into a funkier form. At the same time Lenny himself was pushing the beginning of middle age by this time and apparently felt the need to reassert himself as a rocker. It happens to most people. But of all people,at all times Lenny would probably have been wise to do something a bit different.\n\n  This album by and large possess the same problem as it's two predecessors. It's chocked full of too many similar sounding guitar rockers-most of which I won't even care to mention. At the same time there are signs of greatness as well. \"Love Love Love\" and \"Will You Marry Me\" are both driven funk\/rockers-heavy on the groove and the riffs comes in more in a rhythmic than noisy sense. On \"A Long And Sad Goodbye\" we find Lenny lamenting over his fathers passing and the effect it has on his family. It's amazing how no matter ones age one still feels like something of an orphan in the world when a close family member passes. I know-been through it. \"Dancin' Til Dawn\" takes an excellent turn at that slow,bluesy grinding rock\/disco hybrid The Rolling Stones embarked on during the late 70's\/early 80's. Actually Lenny takes it his own way with just a little more fuzzed out guitar. \"The Moment Is Still There\" brings him back to that Charles Stepney\/EWF styled place with this wonderfully chorded rhythm guitar melody.\n\n  While pieces such as \"Love Revolution\" along with anti war protest pieces \"Back To Vietnam\" and \"I Want To Go Home\" say their mouthfull's lyrically,the music accompanying them offers nothing at all new for Lenny. True that seems to be a partial holding pattern for much of his career. That each step forward is accompanied by several steps back or more. He seems to be one of those people who revels in a \"pastime paradise\" and when he comes out from under that,he has a hard time staying out. In terms of any art,be it music or anything else the past can hold a certain comfort when the creative environment seems weakened. Also being a musical revivalist might be the best way in which Lenny feels best showcases his humanitarian\/Bohemian messages. Either way one cuts it,fact is his messages and songwriting tend to work better when he creatively stretches himself. Especially on the R&B\/funk end of things. And on this album it's more than clear he's done about all he can do on the retro rock end.","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"When Uncle Kracker decided to go solo after a long association with rap\/rocker, Kid Rock, you would have expected some of the same edginess that characterized Rock's music.  Instead, \"Follow Me\" resulted.  This is a piece of soft-rock swill that belongs as a track on one of those laughable \"AM Gold\" albums that used to be sold in informercials late at night, instead of on the top of the pop\/rock charts.\n\nHowever, this sappy love song no doubt appealed to fans who are suckers for this type of music.  In addition, I think there was another group of fans who were wary of another Kid Rock-style singer and embraced Uncle Kracker when they realized exactly how soft his music was.\n\nReally not a fan of this song and I change the radio whenever it comes on.","classification":1,"fold":9}

{"text":"In his 50+ year career Dylan has gone through many different styles of music. Of course everyone remembers Dylan starting out as a folk singer. From there his career when electric then country then religious and most recent years bluesy and even Christmas music. With the most recent release however we find Dylan as a crooner singing pop standards. Not a musical direction you would expect Bob to make but then again he had done that a few times in the past so really nothing new here. The difference is the style of music he chose this time around to sing. I don't think most of us Dylan fans expected this.\n\nAnd what do I think of this album? I really don't know. I have heard \"Shadows In The Night\" a few times now and I am still not sure what I think, if I like this or not. Let me do say this is not a bad album by any means. But at the same time this album hasn't wowed me the way some of his other recent albums like \"Time Out Of Mind\" or \"Modern Times\" has. Bob is in good voice here but even so one problem I have with these songs is that his voice doesn't sound right for this kind of music. His voice was perfect for the kinds of songs he was singing on those two recent albums I previously mentioned but it sounds kind of out of place here. Still there are moments to this record where Bob, the music and the arraingments come together briefly making for a pleasant experience. He does have a feel for the songs being performed. There are moments too though where while Bob hits the notes it almost seems like a struggle for him to hit it.\n\nThis is definitely a record where I can't recommend one way or another if you should get it. You will have to get \"Shadows In The Night\" and listen for yourself and see what you think. What reviews I have read is pretty mixed between people loving it or hating it. You will have to decide for yourself on this one.","classification":3,"fold":9}

Sadly, that honestly is the case with Beyonce' Knowles, and her music right now. She has became so overexposed, she feels more like she is a product than a real human being and talented singer. She has let her talent absolutely go to waste in her music right now. When she had came out with a surprise record last year, it might have became as a sales buying spree, but honestly the songs she has came out with for the Beyonce' record, feel more like they are absolute trash, than strong of a singer suppose to be of her calibre. 7\/11 from the Platinum Edition of the Beyonce' album is absolutely terri blue, and not even worth the voice singing. She had made a song that is absolutely so poor, it is really her worst dance song. Even Get Me Bodied and Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It) seems more like blessings than garbage after hearing this song. She is absolutely not worth listening to anymore, and if she keeps making bad songs like this, I would say it should be time for Ms. Knowles to retire from being  real singer, and end her career.

{"text":"My summary says it all - Johnny Cash was never in 'better voice' than when he recorded this song - that includes his 50's and 60's songs.  He has more range and smoothness in this song than any other - perhaps it's the message that he's trying to send to all believers, and his convictions are well made in the lyrics of this song; quite spooky when you listen to what he has to say, as it applies in the current age as much as it did in 1990, 2001, and now.  I put this song right up there second only to \"Ring of Fire\".  This is Johnny Cash at his best.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Move over Britney, now there's something meatier - and I mean that in a good, tasteful way!!!  This album is HOT, plain and simple.  I heard Jewel's new and unique \"Intuition\" on the radio today, and my ears are still trying to adapt!!  Was that really a hip-hop drumbeat I heard?  And is Jewel trying to go the way of Britney, totally cool, totally dance and TOTALLY pop?  Looks like it!!  And I, for one, am enthralled that Jewel is maturing and reaching out to be different.  Let's face it, people, this is a pop world, and to not be pop is to not be cool.  Like the Spice Girls and Madonna of a different age, Jewel is coming to grips with herself and her music through pop, and I, for one....oops, sorry - I just said that...\nWell, as I mentioned before, it takes true courage to be yourself and try a different sound.  From what I've heard of this album so far, there's lots of trip-hop, lots of dance, and totally lots of fun POP!!  I'm glad Jewel is no longer an Alaskan hippie, and is instead a girl with a new attitude!!\nYou go, girl.....the days of your white van are loooong gone!!!!\nSEE YA' LATER!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":9}

She was in a recored band \"Blue Angel\" that sold nothing. She found herself in finding song writers that fit her fairy tale. A classic 1980's LP\/Cass\/CD \"She's So Unusual\" had 4 (Four !) hits  \"Girl's\", the cover of Brains' punkish \"Money Changes Everything\", the Hooter's cover of the ballad, \"Time After Time\", and the winking smirk of female masturbation, \"She Bop\".

{"text":"I have been listening to this show for almost 30 years now as it was one of the prizes of a very large cassette collection of Grateful Dead concerts that were the focus of my listening attention for several years via my Walkman and headphones. This was one of Dick Latvala's favorite shows and he wanted it released during the Dick's Picks era,  but better late than never as we have it now at last to help close down 2014.\n\nSet one is off and hits fire fast as this is a quite fine \"Bertha>Good Lovin\" combo that lets you know they (the band) are ready to soar. This Fall tour started in Seattle, Washington in late September and after a solid month of shows from the Pacific to the Atlantic the band by this time was more than ready to play...They were at a peak of their playing skills and quite the beast it was.\n\nAfter the finish of the opening thunder Bobby tells the crowd: \"Thank You...Happy Homecoming!\" to an huge cheer from the party-goers. \"Brown Eyed Women\" and \"Cassidy\" both have that extra punch and power thanks to Phil shining in this great HD mix  Dave has presented for us. \"Sunrise\" is a fine spotlight on Donna and she sings it fine at this show.  \"Minglewood\" is a crunchy as it will ever get and \"Dupree's\" that is played next is even better with Jerry in his very best voice. The opening part of set two is tacked upon the first disc with the Jones Gang introduction from Phil that is followed by \"Sampson\" and even before Sampson finds it's normal end Jerry moves right into \"Cold Rain And Snow\" and even though it was rare to hear this one in the late 1970's as part of the show Jerry is going at like he performs it every night...Classic!\n\nDisc two features the big jam of: \"Playing>Eyes Of the World>Estimated>Drums>Iko Iko>Stella Blue>Playing\" that is one the band's finest 75 minutes that you are gonna find anywhere. For as great as Jerry is playing, Bobby never let's up and Phil is on top and at the bottom of everything found here. Don't let me talk about it....Just listen to it!\n\nDisc Three features some highlights of the November 2 show from Seneca College in Toronto, Ontario but as a proud owner of the tapes of that show I have got to go on record here to tell you about what you are missing.....The best version of \"Lazy Lightning>Supplication\" I have ever heard on tape. A wonderful \"St. Stephen\" and a crazy cool version of: \"Around And Around.\" Disc Three is kinda a burn to be released in this fashion as you NEED the full show from Toronto presented in it's complete form.\n\nDave (and Dick) have closed down 2014 in proper style as this is such an excellent collection  it gives me hope for the 50th anniversary sets that will be coming forth next year.\nFIVE STARS!!!","classification":5,"fold":9}

However,  after researching info for a college project (around early 2010) about military conflicts between military forces from Russia and citizens in Afghanistan (during 1980s) and how it tied into the  2000s era of Afghanistan and U.S. military affairs leaves me wanting to avoid publicly saying more.

You may literally feel yourself taking deeper breaths as the world's chaos quietens.\n\nPiano, flute, harp and acoustic guitar create a magical warm melodic perfection.

In a few songs there are lyrics and they were beautiful and meaningful.\n\nThis CD also comes with a DVD which features photographs from the award-winning oceanic photographer Susan Saibara.

I heard a lot of their music during the decade, but frankly, they were old hat.  For whatever reason, move forward 10 years and I perchanced to buy \"The Beatles Rarities\" after spending the decade buying KISS, Tony Orlando & Dawn, The Bee Gees,  and Stevie Wonder, as well as assorted disco records, and the solo recordings of former Beatles.\n\nWhat I heard on this record made me buy all the others.\n\nInside of four months, I was a total Beatles freak, playing them and listening as if they were a brand new group.\n\nAll because of the stellar selection of songs and the versions represented on this album, I began a love affair with the world's greatest rock group, bar none, whose mystique still holds me in its grasp.\n\nThe track selection is listed on the page above, so I need not repeat it, merely point up that the versions included on this marvelous album are indeed different, enough so that they must have seemed newly fresh to me at the time.\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend this album to ANYONE who loves the Beatles.

Sadly, she has been more oversaturated than most other female singers, and the quality of her own voice has been weak than strong with each and every album she has made. When it has came out to they hype around her self-titled album, as a surprise release, she unfortunately has made music that has been weaker with each and every note. Pretty Hurts didn't actually ignite as one of those singles that didn't actually shine.

Sadly, it has also drowned out her talent she had in her, and made her one of the most overexposed artists of the past several years. Her latest song We Found Love from her album Talk That Talk, feels like it is a weak mouse, that lacks in the polish she brought in when she came out in 2005 with Pon De Replay. I really felt it showed poorly just like the songs from her Loud and Rated R records had shown. I think personally for Rihanna, she should take a long break and find herself all over again. Then, she could fins a way to talk that talk for her fans, and for herself.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":9}
{"text":"This is not an album you want to take seriously on any level ... though having said that, this is not an album you can avoid on any level either.  Crazy For You is a stunning collection of lo-fi jangle boy-crazy pop songs presented in a lushly upbeat manner, filled with enough sweet \"ooohs\" and \"ahhhs\" to give give you a sugar rush, harking back to the girl groups of the 50's and 60's, when the ladies stood up and proclaimed their undying affection for summer, and the love of their boyfriends.\n\nOf course back then the girls didn't play their own instruments, nor did they have tattoos ... what they do have in common is a passion for catchy tunes, hooks that unshakably float in your head, and songs that exist somewhere between disappointment, and the agony of life.  At 59, the numbers are a bit shallow, but then the days of peering over an open school locker door, or around the corner to catch a glimpse of the guys smoking at lunch, was a very long time ago.  Though in the same breath I must confess that the smile Best Coast has given me, reminds me how utterly brilliant life was, before things turned serious, and these silly emotions slipped between my fingers like so much summer sand.\n\nThere's only one real sin you can commit, and that is to have forgotten what it was like to be young and in love ... luckily Crazy For You is out there to remind you.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":3,"fold":9}

It's more rock and has much more energy.  I believe that if he had recorded it the way he does the song with Queen, it would have been extremely successful.  I love Adam's voice, the honesty in his lyrics and his performance style.  He changes with every album, always doing something new.

{"text":"The Bear's Choice Expanded Edition focuses on the Grateful Dead live in concert. Four additional tracks are added to the original seven and the late Ron McKernan(Pig Pen) sings on six of them.\nThe opening five acoustic tracks are warm and intimate if not overly spectacular. The Pig Pen sung Katie Mae stands out a bit from the rest. The Smokestack Lightning jams are a bit excessive even though they can be a bit mesmerizing if you merely have them on in the background. However, the highlights of this disc are Pig Pen's stylish singing on Big Boss Man and Hard To Handle. Old Piggie sure knew how to sing the blues.\nAnyway, definitely like Jerry Garcia's interpretation of Sitting On Top Of The World. Again, Good Lovin' is another bonus track on this CD as it was on Europe 72. The jam is somewhat excessive although the drum solo is pretty captivating.\nAgain like Europe 72, several good moments and I like the idea of both acoustic and electric sides of the Grateful Dead. However some of the jamming certainly goes off the deep end. My only advise is know how much endless instrumental noodling that you can take.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nOver the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), with a glossy front cover, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white on a green background and gold-embossed \"Christmas Carols\" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the \"Dot\" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white and \"Christmas Carols\" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The Bach Guild returns from our summer vacation with two of our signature \"Big Bach Sets\", where we attempt to scale the symphonic heights. We did think about combining both of these sets into one, but when we start to conceive boxes that are over 20 hours long...we think it's just too much at once. And at Amazon's great price, a second helping doesn't hurt too much.\nAnd time limits is what birthed this box - the Bach Guild\/Vanguard catalog has a vast library of recordings of the standard repertoire - but not all of it fits neatly into the categories we've created over the past 18 months.  So the symphony stalwarts of classical music have been not included in our Big Bach Set. Without a composer-based theme, we're able to include some of the recordings not seen for decades, which is one of the most enjoyable reasons we release these boxes.\nIn Volume 1 - we've covered works chronologically - we're bringing the Viennese connection to the front of the line. We've written about how early music and Vienna are intertwined in the history of Bach Guild, but the Vienna State Opera Orchestra paid the bills. For informational purposes, the Vienna State was simply the Vienna Philharmonic, minus the first chair players. In post-World War II Vienna, these musicians would work for pay, and work they did. Vanguard\/Bach Guild made hundreds of records in about a decade, providing the catalog backbone of the label that eventually became more than just a classical music recording company.\nSo the Vienna boys provided hours of repertoire - and we feature them in this box, providing Mozart's last two symphonies, a selection of Haydn's London symphonies, and making their digital debuts, Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 (From the New World) and Mendelssohn's last three symphonies.\nAnd one note about a perhaps long forgotten artist - Vladimir Golschmann.  On the wall of Seymour Solomon's home are two ads, both autographed, both featuring Vladimir Golschmann.  As conductor of the St. Louis Symphony, and a regular feature of New York recording sessions, he cut a figure that definitely impressed Madison Avenue. He was first featured in an ad for Calvert, holding a glass of \"The Aristocrat of Highballs\". And he was also \"The Man in the Arrow Shirt\". And a quick web search finds Arrow shirt ads, right next to reviews of his concerts.  Golschmann made over 30 recordings for Vanguard, and was conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra for over 20 years.","classification":5,"fold":9}

When it has came out to releasing a surprise album, it has been more like a joke than anyone who has a real sentiment for their voice. The songs that she has came out with, sound overall more pathetic than show a real sense of her voice.

Beyonce' and Jay-Z do not ignite, no matter how much the song. They have done so many collaborations like Deja Vu and Crazy In Love, that they do not connect in music and song.

She sings \"All Through the Night,\" one of my favorite songs that is not often considered a Christmas song, but my family has often played it at holiday time, \"Sleep my love & peace attend thee all through the night, guardian angels God will send thee.\"  It's such a gentle lullaby with Colvin's tender reading.  \"Love Came Down at Christmas\" is another sweet track, \"Love be yours & love be mine, love to God and all of us.\"  This quiet CD is soothing and gentle, a perfect disc to play while watching the lights twinkle on the Christmas tree.

{"text":"I would add this light, upbeat version to play along side Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams and similar classic Christmas music, although this is a little more modern version.  The voices are very \"soft\" and perform in a gentle harmony.  Contrast that with other versions that may have richer or bolder harmony; this, however, stands well on its own merits.  There are some jazzy riffs here and there, some soft, jazzy hi hat\/drum rhythm in the background.  I don't think any one voice stands out on this piece, but together they work very well. Not quite the Lennon Sisters (if you know who they are), but along the same vein.  Personally, I enjoyed this piece and am pleased to add it to my Christmas music collection.\n\nIf Lawrence Welk was alive today and continuing his show, I think you would hear this group performing this piece on his show.

{"text":"Josh Groban has clearly taken time to choose just the material he wants to showcase his abilities and delight his listeners with \"Illuminations.\" He sings with warmth, grace and dexterity, not to mention technical precision and prowess that cannot be credibly argued against.\n\nSome prefer a singer who show signs of exertion when they perform. Josh Groban is not that kind of singer. His technical gift is so obvious and great that he never seems to break a sweat. He runs the risk of seeming less than sincere or earnest as a result, since he so obviously never has to reach high to achieve terrific results, which he does here.\n\nFortunately, the songs are often very strong - and his enthusiasm for them so great - that getting lost in his rich, lyrical baritone is inevitable from a single spin.\n\nHe soars especially on the non-English material. \"L'Oro D'ell Addio\" is wall to wall high-flying rapture, with Groban's voice going deeply low and marvelously high with undiluted grace and beauty. \"Au Jardin Des-Sans Pourquoi\" is similar, with seamless, breathtaking orchestration and Groban's impassioned vocals pouring over it like melted butter.\n\nHe will not be recording duets with Rihanna or Katy Perry anytime soon.\n\nA couple English tunes stand out because they are, succinctly, not good enough.  They sound pleasant - everything Groban has wrapped his voice around is worth hearing - but it is hard not to feel that they are a waste of his sprawling talent. He sounds remarkably invested in \"Higher Window,\" which is gorgeously orchestrated and arranged, but its lyrics border on banal and its melody is not imaginative or engaging. The same goes for \"Hidden Away,\" which sounds formulaic and predictable, even if his voice is -indeed - stunning and huggably warm.\n\nHe does display imagination as a song writer on \"War at Home,\" which focuses on domestic troubles without sounding trite or earthbound. It is not jarring, even as it as immediately follows the uncontainable, deadly serious \"Voce Existe en Mim,\" a Portugese tune.\n\n\"Straight to You\" is epic and grandiose without sounding stuffy or insincere - a heartrending finale that finishes the disc ideally.\n\nFans of Groban will relish this album and wear it out like an old cliche. True, not every tune is worthy of his pipes, but then that sets the standards unfairly high. Voices like his are rare, and song by song \"Illuminations\" proves that.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Finally free from record companies, contracts, and the like; Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor has unleashed \"Ghosts I-IV\", an entire album of instrumental work.  As a longtime NIN fan, I personally was a little apprehensive when I first approached \"Ghosts\", but thankfully, I ended up being pretty satisfied.  Tracks 22, 24, and 28 in particular are the most memorable moments to be heard here, as there are some great uses of the piano (!) to be heard that are peppered throughout the album.  Although at times \"Ghosts\" borderlines on self-indulgence, as a whole, the album is a real treat, and is a welcome departure from Nine Inch Nails' usual brand of discontent.  Clocking in at under two hours in length, \"Ghosts\" moves along without ever really feeling that long at all.  All in all, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is a more than welcome cry of freedom from Trent Reznor and co., and with more \"Ghosts\" promised to be appearing in the future, here's hoping that Nine Inch Nails continue to climb new heights of creativity.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The obvious: This album is quite different than Simpsons previous two releases.  The two constants are Sturgill's voice and the trippy guitar work.  It will be interesting to see his live show and how he interplays with his older music.  Hopefully this album will lower the number of drunk cowbow-wannabes who show up rowdy at Sturgill's concerts.  Unfortunately, they'll likely be yelling catcalls during Simpson's slower songs (i.e. Sarah).\nFrom the get-go, I really like the cover of In Bloom.  Yes, it could be argued that it's over-produced.  I'm glad that Simpson is not simply doing the same album again and again, just because he found a 'formula' that listeners like.  This album, like it or not, tells me that Sturgill Simpson is here to stay, as he's not resting on his laurels and that he's able to generate his creative juices from more than one source.\nBrace For Impact and the slide guitar work on it are more along the lines of what we might have expected for this album from Simpson and his band.  For me, the final cut on A Sailor's Guide to Earth is the high energy, come to life song, Call To Arms, which will have Sturgill's audience bouncing off one another as he kicks ass!\nBeing someone who likes a variety of good music, I like that Sturgill is willing to take a chance with his music, even at the risk of losing some of his recently added audience.\nI just wish I could understand his vocals easier, especially when he's in concert.  For all I know, the guy doesn't sing in English. ;->","classification":4,"fold":9}

It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Unclassified is Robert Randolph's second album, but his first studio effort. His first album, Live At Wetlands, showed that Mr. Randolph plays one mean steel guitar. The question would be if that same sweat and fire could be recreated in the studio. The answer is a resounding yes. Mr. Randolph cut his teeth playing in a Pentecostal church in his hometown of Orange, New Jersey and the album has clear gospel roots. But the band is really more of a funk and roll band in the Parliament-Funkadelic mold. Mr. Randolph's steel guitar is often counterbalanced by popping bass lines and wailing organs. \"So Refreshing\" has a funky bass and buzz saw steel riff and \"Squeeze\" has fiery organs that perfectly contrast the wicked steel guitar. \"I Need More Love\" has a call and response chorus that sits atop a hard funk groove that is very Stevie Wonder like. \"Smile\" slows things down and features tender harmonies. \"Calypso\" has a Latin-jazz-rock Santana vibe and \"Run For Your Life\" closes out the disk on a full-out Jersey bar sound. Robert Randolph is one of the most gifted guitarists to come around in a long time and his music demands your attention.","classification":5,"fold":9}

If it was, surely a club song like 'Papi', 'Invading My Mind', or 'Hypnotico' from Jennifer's 'Love?' album would have been chosen to follow the success. Instead, this summery single is just pleasant without ever catching fire, immediately inferior but less polarizing than the aforementioned songs.\n\nLil Wayne's feature surely had much to do with this choice of a single, though many flop singles in the past have shown that an artist doesn't necessarily equate to success. This song will likely crack the Top 40 or 30 on Billboard, but it's a shame if this stops the 'Love?' campaign. Jennifer has recorded some spectacular pop songs for the album, this being simply middle of the pack.\n\nBottom line: If you like what you hear in the clip, you'll surely enjoy the song, since there's not much else to it.

{"text":"When I first heard this album, I was a bit disappointed. After all, the band indicated this might be the best thing they'd written (which always makes me a bit skeptical). \"Happy Idiot\" was a great lead single that demonstrated the band certainly still has what it takes to make a great album. However, on first album listen, Seeds seemed too tame and lacked the innovation and surprises that make earlier TV on the Radio efforts so good.\n\nYet I found myself drawn back to this album again and again. It has quickly grown on me as a well-balanced and emotional effort that delivers more and more upon each listen. These aren't songs that are going to punch you right away, but they are going to stick with you if you give them the chance to grow. Tunde Adebimpe's vocals have never been so strong, and there's plenty of innovation on this album if you are willing to look for it.\n\nIt's not the best album in TV on the Radio's catalog, but it's the best they've done in awhile. Just make sure you give it a chance.\n\nEdit (December 4th): I finally got my vinyl copy of this album, and I'm upgrading my review to 5 stars. The artwork and packaging are beautiful, and the record sounds loads better than the mp3s. It's a much fuller listening experiencing, and the mastering is much better. This is now a candidate for album of the year for me.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"In 1992 P.J. Harvey released her debut LP. The Album Dry was released on an indie label and the budget was just around 5 thousand dollars. Often proclaimed to be one of females rawest and toughest albums this album took me as a suprise it is nowhere near the desription I read. Dry may be perhaps PJ.\nLess accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to. Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it's follow-up Rid Of Me. Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella, Victory, Happy And Bleeding, Sheela - Na - Gig, Hair, Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable. And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver. It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it doesn't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden. It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums.\nHowever PJ. Harvey's Dry has indeed something special about it and lyrically it is very good much better then Rid Of Me but musically it is less compelling and challenging then any of her other albums but it is her debut and if this had only included these 7 songs it would have been an artistic triumph and something that polly jean would be proud of all her life.","classification":3,"fold":9}

As I got lucky and saw AC\/DC twice during their most memorable 'Black Ice' 2009-2010 World Tour. Both times had a two-song difference in the set lists - so Angus Young and crew definitely does ~not~ play the same songs at every single gig they do. Didn't bother with the DVD - maybe later. Four tunes off the acclaimed 'Black Ice' CD - the frantic opener \"Rock 'N Roll Train\", \"Big Jack\", title track \"Black Ice\" and \"War Machine\". Can't get enough of those Bon Scott gems - that you might not hear every day - like \"Shot Down In Flames\" and the ass-kicking \"Dog Eat Dog\". Plus all the AC\/DC live staples we have come to know [and love] \"Back In Black\", \"Shoot To Thrill\", \"Whole Lotta Rose\" (complete with giant inflatable blow-up woman), one of my all-time favorites \"Let There Be Rock\" and the grand finale \"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\".

{"text":"Shame on me for being late to the party on this one now that it's five months after Hanukkah and Xmas - not that this album isn't merry enough to enjoy all year long.\n\nThe vast majority of Xmas LPs feel uninspired, perfunctory and bland, verging on being little more than cynical cash grabs and catalog fillers that exploit the artist's fans.  But then, out of nowhere, there is \"It's a Holiday Soul Party\" by Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings (backing vocals by the fantastic Shaun & Starr) to restore our faith in total musical integrity by an outfit who are genuinely feeling the spirit of the season.\n\nThe festivities begin with a joyous and energetic, brassy and raucous Dap-Kings original celebrating the \"8 Days (of Hanukkah).\"  It is appropriately the lead-off number, since Hanukkah precedes Xmas on the calendar (plus, Hannukkah songs are rather few and far between).  Now that the album has your full attention, here comes the brand-new Xmas soul classic-in-the-making, the gripping, reality-based \"Ain't No Chimneys in the Projects,\" penned by Sharon Jones and producer Bosco Mann.  With the superlative support of Shaun & Starr, \"Just Another Christmas Song,\" whose lyrics name-check a string of well-known titles, sounds like Jones is fronting some stellar girl-soul group from 1969 on this midtempo sweetly funky gem.\n\nSome familiar seasonal songs are here in the form of \"Funky Little Drummer Boy\" (the title tells the story!); \"White Christmas\" as it has never been heard before - sizzlingly fast and furiously funky; \"Silver Bells as a gospel-funk hybrid; and a sensationally rendered \"Silent Night\" as a slow blues.\n\nSpeaking of blues, Charles Brown's \"Please Come Home for Christmas\" might seem a bit too obvious an inclusion, but this has to be one of the best covers of it ever attempted.  Jones, as she is throughout this album - no matter what the style - is deep into her vocal sweet spot.  The off-the-wall \"Big Bulbs\" features magnificent trumpet and multi-tracked vocal harmonies.  The outstanding production values elevate the fun quotient considerably.\n\nThis set winds down with the mellow sixties sound of \"World of Love,\" with its essential theme of making a better world for the children; and then comes to a close with the Dap-Kings' soul-jazzy, horn-driven instrumental take on \"God Rest Ye Merry Gents.\"\n\nThis album really packs a wallop in its 34 minutes, as it joins the ranks of great soul holiday LPs of all time.","classification":5,"fold":9}

When she had came out with her surprise album in 2013, it felt more like a publicity stunt than a shocker, largely because she has not had the strong songs that have been worth it. Honestly, she did not take her time in her work, like the lackluster 4 album, which was more poorly made, than the sense she is a more built diva that has a voice, than a product. Her song Blue, from her self-titled album, was written in regards to the change in her life, becoming a new mother and having a new-found sense of a serenity. The song is one of her better ballads, but not really anything that is worth driving at the heart of the matter. Beyonce' Knowles needs to do better with her songs through the heart, largely because this song wasn't worth it.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"In late 2001, Cher had released, yet, another album. No, this one is not a compilation; it is a studio recorded album. No, you did not read this statement wrong. This album is, indeed, another studio recorded album for Cher. The album is entitled, LIVING PROOF, and is her best album since that of  1998's BELIEVE. The album is jam packed with great songs, including four hit singles that were released. Read on to find out more.\n\nSONG FOR THE LONELY\n\n  The first single from the album. When I first heard this song, I was really amazed. I could not believe how incredible this song was. The lyrics are so strong and motivating, as Cher's voice is strong and powerful. I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1) It is the first song on the album, and 2) Cher has dedicated this song to, and I quote from her album thanks, \"...The courageous people of New York, Mayor Gulianni, Governor Pataki, and my friend Liz...\"\n\nA DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG\n\n  The third single from the album. This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get-together parties. This is definitely a kick-a** tune.\n\nALIVE AGAIN\n\n  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome tune.\n\nTHE MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU\n\n  The second single from the album. \"A Different Kind Of Love Song\" is not the only song that should be played in clubs; this song would also fit into that of clubs, where people can immediately get their groove on. This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a** on the dance floor.\n\nRAIN, RAIN\n\n  Not bad.\n\nREAL LOVE\n\n  Not bad.\n\nLOVE SO HIGH\n\n  Incredible\n\nBODY TO BODY, HEART TO HEART\n\n  Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember. She has written such songs as, \"Who Will You Run To\" for Heart, \"Love Can Move Mountains\" for Celine Dion, & \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" for Cher. This was another one of Diane Warren's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane's lyrics with her music and voice.\n\nLOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU\n\n  Great.\n\nLOVE ONE ANOTHER\n\n  Back in 2000, when Amber released her self-titled album, she had originally recorded this song. Cher took the courage to cover the song. The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version, even though her version kicked a** as well. If you listen to both versions, you'll notice that Cher had re-written the second verse for her version, as well as re-writing the last two lines of the song's bridge.\n\nWHEN YOU WALK AWAY\n\n  Not bad.\n\nWHEN THE MONEY'S GONE\n\n  Not bad.\n\n  This is an album that I have enjoyed from start to finish and I do encourage each and everyone of you, who have not yet heard this album, to buy it and listen to it. I guarantee you all that you will enjoy every song on this album from start to finish. If you do not like it, than I've done my part, while receiving the wrong response.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Eightball & MJG have long been staples in the Southern hip hop scene, flying just under the radar of national acclaim with every release.  Even with a handful of singles and guest appearances and years of making classics and hits they still haven't 'blown up'.  Now seems to be the time for them as they have the marketing talent of P. Diddy and Bad Boy South this time out.  And this time there's no excuses.\nRight out the gate Eightball & MJG show that these are the same ol boys from Memphis with 'You Don't Want Drama', a menacing club track with aggressiveness we haven't heard from them since 'Lay It Down'.  Now THIS is a comeback track, letting people know that can hang in today's industry.  They get down with Bun B on 'The Streets', which is arguably the best song on the album.  Eightball delivers the tightest verse and the beat is beyond greatness.  Shot Off feat. Ludacris is also a 5 star track with another magnificent beat and gangsta flows from everybody.  Look At The Grillz has Twista, TI, and Eightball & MJG completely ripping it up; especially Twista.  They spit over a thumping Lil John beat (no adlibs).  THis is destined to be a classic down south.  Forever feat. Lloyd is insanely tight.  When I first saw this collaboration, I thought it would be sappy because Lloyd is kind of a new school Ralph 'Sensitivity' Tresvant.  Not that that is bad, I love some Ralph Tresvant, but it didn't seem like it would work for the album.  But it does...perfectly.\nEvery friggin song is off the chain.  Just check the gangstaness of When It's On, or the crunkness of 'Don't Make', or the flyness of Trying To Get At You, or the introspectiveness of Confessions.  Whatever these boys touch on the album is pure gold.  This album ranks as one of Ball & G's best, right up there with On Top Of The World & In Our Lifetime Vol. 1; it's that good.  The only problem I have is the interludes and the fact that they didn't rap over the 'Get A Kit' beat, that would have been a vintage, classic Ball & G ridin track.  What were they thinking?  But Anyway, this album is easily a must have for 2004 and beyond.  One of the year's best! 5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":9}

I haven't checked out most of her previous work but I was really interested in \"We Are Born\" because it had two of my favorite songs from her, \"Clap Your Hands\" and \"You've Changed\". I'm glad to say that this album as a whole, is stellar! Sia has an awesome vocal range that's so soulful and complex yet she knows how to balance it amidst an electronic sound landscape. She has a lot of strength in her voice but isn't afraid to use it lightly when the time is right. Her lyrics are fun, never too heavy-handed and she takes subject matter that's been done a million times but makes it feel completely new and fresh, you can't help but be swept into the playfulness she exudes with her arrangements. It's a very electronic sound, so if you don't like that, you might not like it all that much. Still, Sia's voice is worth taking a listen. It's crazy to think that no-talent hacks get more play than an accomplished artist like Sia but alas, that's sometimes how it works. Anyway, I highly recommend this album to any and all who want something divine to listen to.","classification":5,"fold":9}

When she released her greatest hits album, there were a lot of songs she had came out with, some good and some bad. But she did have  some excellent songs she recorded for the record. Could I Have This Kiss Forever, with Enrique Iglesias honestly one of those few songs that have showed her sensual voice heart and soul. While it hasn't had that longevity as other duets that Whitney had made for years whether it was the great Teddy Pendergrass or her ex-husband Bobby Brown on Something In Common. Still, it honestly is a electrifying song that still delivers so well.

{"text":"There is always a lot riding on a music act after a very successful debut album. When the follow up is released it will truly be the make or break.\n\nIn the case of the popular band Imagine Dragons, Smoke + Mirrors is a very well made second attempt. You definitely know it is them thanks to the vocals, but the songs while some are nothing great the album as a while is a very good listen. I absolutely love the first track 'Shots', it is a real perk up and powerful. 'Gold' is great as well as 'I Bet My Life', but I am concerned that those to films have the chance of becoming those 'overplayed' ones on the radio. Still, I am very happy with the over all album and I am glad. The reason is because this is one of the better music acts today and I am glad to know that the outcome of this album will lead to a third release in the coming years.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"There is a soulfulness to Alex Clare's voice that cannot be ignored.  In fact, when I first heard `Too Close' I actually thought it was James Morrison trying his hand at a more rock centered sound.  Yes, Alex Clare delivers some depth to the proceedings by allowing a grovel and an honesty pierce his music.  It isn't always enough to keep the album relevant, but for the most part `The Lateness of the Hour' proves to be a worthwhile endeavor for both Clare and us.\n\nWhile `Too Close' certainly got our attention, it is in the softer, quieter moments that this album truly shines.  Songs like `Relax My Beloved' and `Whispering' allow Clare to develop a deeper sound and more personal connection through the subtle music and his entrancing tone.  Songs like `Up All Night' and `Humming Bird' develop the rock sound Clare is trying to establish (a notch below `Too Close' with catchier elements) and they prove successful as a whole.  `Hands Are Clever' breaks up what feels like an almost too routine sound with some jazzy Southern charm.  But there is where my main complaint for this album lies; it does sound very `matchy matchy'.  The album sounds so `put together' with almost every track leading into the next with a sound that is very similar.  While I understand that this can be a plus (at least it doesn't feel disjointed) it can also lead to a feeling of monotony.  It doesn't help that some songs, namely `Tightrope', feel devoid of life.\n\nStill, the highs here are worthy of note and really, Alex Clare does offer something interesting to modern music.  His vocals have a very aged soulful sound, and his musical direction has a very modern progressive pop rock sound, so marrying the two together can produce something interesting.  I look forward to where his career takes him.  Despite some aforementioned issues (and the way he says `Sanctuary') I actually like this album, at least in parts, and recommend taking a peak!","classification":4,"fold":9}

It would best to do the last way first, but sometimes we need to train the ear. Hence, I had doubts initially but at the end realized that this is a very fine, not perfect, group of recordings. Paper Moon and Fever are stunningly good and most others are nicely interpreted, with performances that grab attention. The band has its particularly rich moments, and special kudos to bassist Kevin Axt's key lines. Although several tunes do not succeed for me, the album grows on you, and if you have other Tierney Sutton recordings, you will need to obtain this album where Sutton stretches into the slow, thoughtful ballad.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"When it has came down to Sting's songwriting, he has shown a lot for his solo work, but that also worked very well with the intimacy of The Police, and the way they captured a beautiful sound. The songs from Rock and Pop still have stood the test of time, nearly 30 years after their last record Synchronicity. But out of all the songs the trio had done, the one that has stood the test of time and beyond in Every Breath You Take. It is definitely one of the most iconic songs of all time that has put words beyond what could ever be said. I like the song not only because of the rhythm, but it really takes me back to a time when music was really becoming all about fads in the 80's, but this songs goes beyond the fads, and stays true to the song. Sting may have wrote it in regards to a divorce, but the song is definitely a must download for any Police fan, or for anyone who had never heard their music before.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":9}

There is a solid group of producers, a more than solid group of lyricsts, and it just does not come together.  There is a variety of producers, delivering a bunch of uninspired beats that stray from Slaughterhouse's usual feel; a lot of the beats sound uptempo rather than hardcore, dark, and\/or grimey.  The lyrics are on point but not as strong as their previous releases.  The extra flair and different atmosphere takes away from their lyrical performances, as the content is better suited for Royce only.  Content has changed a quite a bit but there ia still a bit of raw spitting and substance sprinkled throughout.  The strengths are muddled by the more uptempo feel and uninteresting hooks.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"This unusual narrative of the love-gone-wrong song is a creative stab at showing a bit of\nthe other side of the story. It uses the call and response technique to help round out\nwhat appears, at first, to be a one sided view.\n\n\"...you felt so happy you could die...\"\n\nThe male makes his usual complaints with some standard phrases. After two sets of lyrics\nand the refrain the woman's point of view is inserted but once. She then interjects her\npoint of view as the Response to the man's Call...\n\n\"...you didn't have to cut me up...\".\n\nThe notes that are repeated through out the song most importantly, in between the lyrics,\nseems almost sour in their presentation. I am not sure what instrument is being used but\nit is effective and gives the song an initial quirky feeling that evolves as the unusual\ninterdiction of the female part is played out. The xylophone is a nice touch in the intro and\noutro.\n\n\"...you can become addicted to a certain kind of sadness...\"\n\nThe title of the song is a failed attempt at being casual even while the alleged protagonist,\nthe guy, makes his bitter complaints. With that technique, the introduction of the woman,\nin essentially the middle of the song, makes this piece a wonderful left turn as an enjoyable\nlook into a failed relationship. Go figure.\n\n\"...now you're just somebody I used to know...\"\n\nYou can hear the woman's continuing Response to the man's Call echoed as he repeats,\n\"you're just someone I used to know\". Who is he trying to convince?\n\nThere is a poignancy to this song in so much that I didn't take sides and need to remember\nthat there is at least two sides to every story.

{"text":"Though Janiva Magness began her music career in the 1980s, she didn't move to Los Angeles and start recording until the 1990s. By that point, radio had fragmented, and the opportunities for soulful blues-based vocalists to break into the mainstream were a great deal more limited. Had she jump-started her career a decade (or two) earlier, she might have ridden the wave of popular blues that found Bonnie Raitt establishing herself commercially. But even with that ship having sailed, it's surprising that none of Magness' work broke through alongside the popular neo-soul success of Amy Winehouse, Adele and others. Her award-heavy career has made her a star in the blues world, though, and perhaps that's the best place for someone who wants to have a long career that stays true to their soul.\n\nMagness picked up a lot of life's grit at an early age; orphaned in her teens, she spent time on the streets and became pregnant at 17. But she was saved by the blues, and working in a recording studio she graduated from technical work to background singing and eventually to the spotlight. She turned out performances that were tough, sultry and soulful, retooling other people's material (often surprisingly, such as her version of Matthew Sweet's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Thought-I-Knew-You\/dp\/B0072Z4ED0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Thought I Knew You<\/a>\") to meet her artistic needs. But with her latest, she's dug into the emotions of recent turmoil (divorce, the deaths of friends, family and pets, and a neck injury that almost ended her career) to create her first full album full of original material.\n\nMagness doesn't spare herself in the analysis, opening the album with an admission of fault and a quest for solid ground. She gives pep talks (\"Twice as Strong\" and \"The Hard Way\"), most likely to herself, but still feels loss and longing (\"When You Were My King\" and \"I Need a Man\"). The album's steps towards recovery include hard truths, commiseration and the slow return of trust. There are moments of bargaining (\"Mountain\") and recrimination (\"Badass\"), but the songs are surprisingly light on bitterness. The closer, \"Standing,\" is sung with a vocal waver whose aching vulnerability brings to mind Ronnie Spector and Patty Scialfa.\n\nProducer Dave Darling frames Magness' earthiness in arrangements that recall the warm instrumental voices of classic soul, but with a few production touches that lend a modern air. The music seems to buoy Magness willingness to expose herself firsthand, rather than through interpretation. It's a big step for someone who'd long-since talked themselves out of writing, a step that began with 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stronger-for-It\/dp\/B006V7RJXC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stronger for It<\/a>, but became a necessity with the past few years' personal trials. Perhaps she was too busy living her life to think about it as subject matter, but as she demonstrates on this new album, there's a unique connection to be found with one's own story.

{"text":"The Bach Guild's new releases -- The Big Great Symphony Box Volume 1 and 2 -- both offer a mix of re-releases from their previous offerings plus enough new material to keep loyal followers of the series (like me) interested. If you haven't been buying these boxes in their composer-focused releases, these sets are both no-brainers.\n\nI have been buying the sets from the beginning, so for me there are a lot of repeats here. But I still found enough tantalizing new material to get me to happily plunk down 99 cents apiece for these collections. (My happiness may turn to chagrin later if the Bach Guild repackages the Sibelius and Ives on offer here with the missing elements of the respective symphony cycles they have in their vaults, but even then I don't think I'll miss that dollar too terribly.)\n\nHere is a track listing of this set, Volume 2, with an indication of composers and repeats, where applicable:\n\n1-4  Brahms No. 1 (repeat from Big Brahms Box)\n5-8  Brahms No. 2 (repeat from Big Brahms Box)\n9-12  Brahms No. 3 (repeat from Big Brahms Box)\n13-16 Brahms No. 4 (repeat from Big Brahms Box)\n17-20 Tchaikovsky No. 4 (repeat from Big Tchaikovsky Box)\n21-24 Tchaikovsky No. 6 (repeat from Big Tchaikovsky Box)\n25-28 Sibelius No. 2\n29-31 Sibelius No. 5\n32-35 Mahler No. 1 - \"Titan\" (repeat from Big Mahler Box)\n36-40 Mahler No. 2 - \"Resurrection\" (repeat from Big Mahler Box)\n41-45 Mahler No. 5 (repeat from Big Mahler Box)\n46-49 Mahler No. 9 (repeat from Big Mahler Box)\n50-53 Ives No. 1\n54-56 Ives No. 2\n57-59 Ives No. 3 - \"The Camp Meeting\"\n\nSo for me, the new material included five symphonies -- the two Sibelius works performed by the Utah Symphony under Maurice Abravanel, extracted from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-set-of-the-complete-Sibelius-cycle-on-Vanguard\/dp\/B005IY3DDO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this set of the complete Sibelius cycle on Vanguard<\/a>, and the first three symphonies by Charles Ives, performed by the New Philharmonia Orchestra under Harold Farberman. I know this combo also recorded the fourth and final Ives symphony as well, because it was released on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-album\/dp\/B00000E9BC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this album<\/a>.\n\nI really enjoyed the Sibelius, but I still think you can't get much better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-bargain-set-on-Bis\/dp\/B004Z4ZN4A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this bargain set on Bis<\/a>&nbsp;for Sibelius. I was most excited by Farberman's Ives. I really like Farberman's take on Mahler's symphonies so was eager to hear what he would bring to Ives. My first reaction is that these revolutionary works seem disappointingly tame here, but there are so many ways to read Ives that I need to give these recordings a few more spins before forming a firm opinion. And just doing that -- listening to and thinking about Ives for a few hours -- will be more entertainment for my 99 cents than I would have a right to expect.\n\nThe previously released symphonies are mainly winners -- all by Utah\/Abravanel, except the Tchaikovsky. Check the excellent reviews of the earlier Big Boxes for more on those recordings.\n\nTechnical quality is good (although I have only listened to the new-to-me tracks -- I trust the others are the same as in their original releases). Bitrates are variable and average 236-263 kbps. Total download size for those foolhardy enough is 1.13 GB for 10.9 hours of music.\n\nRecommended for anybody at the introductory price. A good deal even for Bach Guild followers -- unless you can't stand Charles Ives and already have a bunch of great Sibelius.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Commonly known as the \"Blue Album\", the 2LP vinyl set \"1967 - 1970\" became an instant classic when it was first released in April 1973 (as did its \"Red\" counterpart \"1962-1966\"). When they were finally reissued onto the new CD format in 1993 however, they caused consternation because of their extortionate full price.\n\nSo is this newly remastered 2010 mid-priced 2CD reissue on EMI\/Apple 5099990674723 any better - the answer is an emphatic 'yes'.\n\nPACKAGING:\nThe first thing you notice is that the clunky double jewel-case of the 1993 reissue has been dumped for a three-way foldout card sleeve. The centre and right flaps picture the photograph on the inner gatefold of the original vinyl double album (St. Pancras Old Church in London, 27 July 1969, The Beatles with the public looking through the railings - it's the same photo on the \"Red\" album). It also houses the two CDs - CD1 has the full Apple label (14 tracks, 51:15 minutes) and the 2nd CD has the half Apple logo (14 tracks, 48:43 minutes). The vinyl set is yet to come, the Digital Download versions are available from 25 Oct 2010 and there's also an issue that lumps both the Blue & Red reissues together as one package in late November.\n\nThe left flap houses a new 32-page booklet. The lyrics are intact from the inner sleeves of the original album issue, there's new liner notes by BILL FLANAGAN the MTV Executive and author of \"Evening's Empire\" (a book on Rock in the Sixties) and there's plenty of superb colour photos from the period - it's impressively done. Downsides - some complained that the 09\/09\/09 card digipak sleeves for The Beatles reissues were easy to smudge once out of the shrinkwrap and worse - the inner flaps easy to tear as you removed the disc. I'm afraid these are the same. I suppose I would have been nave of us to think that EMI would actually listen to the complaints of 2009 about packaging, but they haven't - the need for these issues to look the same as the preceding ones has overridden all considerations... Having said that, I still think they look great - substantial even...\n\nPLAYING TIMES:\nUnlike the \"Red\" issue which could easily have fitted onto 1CD (and even included bonus tracks), as you can see from the playing times provided above, it would not have been possible with this set. Anyway - EMI would of course argue that a single CD issue of this most `iconic' of double albums would fundamentally alter the aesthetic of the original release. At least this time, this 2CD reissue is at mid price, so we're not being charged for the privilege of separation.\n\nTRACK CHOICES:\nThe compilation itself is basically the A-sides of all their UK 7\" singles releases between 1967 and 1970 in chronological release date order with a few key album tracks thrown in for good measure. Eagle-eye fans would therefore note that up to and including \"Get Back\" - ALL Beatles UK 7\" singles for that period were issued only in MONO (\"The Ballad Of John & Yoko\" was their 1st STEREO single in the UK). So the tracks on the album should reflect that - the MONO single mixes. But EMI did nothing of the sort. They're all in STEREO (there's 4 MONO on the \"Red\" set) and i would argue that accuracy's loss is the listener's gain, because the STEREO versions used here are awesome.\n\nSOUND:\nAlthough the compilation is copyrighted to 2010 (released Monday 18 Oct 2010 in the UK and 19 Oct 2010 in the USA), the liner notes don't try to hide that these are the 2009 remasters by the same team who did the much-praised Beatles catalogue of 09\/09\/09. The sound quality is fantastic - breathtaking clarity on instruments - the piano and guitars on \"Lady Madonna\", the jet screeching in at the opening of \"Back In The U.S.S.R\", the brass on \"All You Need Is Love\", Billy Preston's superb keyboard work on \"Let It Be\", the wonderfully loose live feel of \"Don't Let Me Down\" (best B-side ever?) - and so on.\n\nCONTENT:\nBut what impresses most is the actual listen itself. Even now, it's truly shocking to hear just how accomplished The Beatles became during this ludicrously productive period. And diversity of writers crept in too. There's the 4 Harrison gems \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Old Brown Shoe\" and the magical double of \"Something\" and \"Here Comes The Sun\", while Ringo gets the witty \"Octopus's Garden\". Leaving the rest as Lennon-McCartney originals. And what an embarrassment of riches they are...\n\n7\" perfection comes twice - \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" b\/w \"Penny Lane\" and arguably the greatest single ever released - \"Hey Jude\" b\/w \"Revolution\" (melodious Paul on the A with rockin' blistering John on the B). Most bands would kill a close relative to get anywhere near this level of genius. And by the time you get to the ballads at the end of Disc 2 - \"The Long And Winding Road\" and \"Across The Universe\" - adjectives begin to fail you... Were The Beatles really 'this' good - the answer is yes - and always will be.\n\nTo sum up - the sound on these new reissues is fabulous; the packaging better than the 1993 versions and each is being sold at mid-price - available in most places for less than the price of a single new album. You can't help but think that millions of people globally will take one look at these beauties on a shelf somewhere and slap them straight into their shopping baskets. And rightly so...\n\nI've loved re-hearing these classic Beatles songs in this beautiful sound quality - I really have - and despite some minor packaging quibbles - the 2010 version of the \"Blue\" album is wholeheartedly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"4 stars for what it is in the history of metal, 3 stars for how it now\ncompares to what it was back in the day.\n\nIn short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a \"tune\" or two). I love true heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.\n\nBut Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.\n\n  That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.\n\n  This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it?

{"text":"Picking up where \"Highway 37\" left off, Train keep up their winning streak with \"Picasso Cadillac.\" Pleasing pop rock, a variety of styles and Pat Monahan's easy on the ears voice. From a far back place, he cries out \"hey baby\" on the opening \"Cadillac Cadillac,\" like he's vying for your attention, and he keeps it for the album's 12 songs. They also keep the harmonies intact, especially the opening to \"Angel In Blue Jeans,\" which is downright soulful.\n\nThere's even some toying with country western, as the typical country topic \"I'm Drinking Tonight\" finds him pining for a lost love. What's the way out? \"The only thing stronger than you is whiskey...poison's the cure.\" Reminded me a little of Chris Isaak's high lonesome, just without the falsetto. Speaking of falsettos, Pat gives his some running room on \"Give It All,\" which veers in the direction of Maroon 5. There's plenty of romance and life lessons to go around, especially on the make up song \"Baby, Happy Birthday,\" where a chastened Pat sings his heart out for forgiveness. Or the sweet acoustic \"Don't Grow Up So Fast,\" this time sung as a reminder of parenthood to keep the growing years precious in your hearts.\n\nStill, there's lots of playful and catchy material here. The bubbly duet with Marsha Ambrosius, Wonder What You're Doing For The Rest Of Your Life\" even has the band in giggles at the start. While I think \"Highway 37\" has the edge as the better album, \"Bulletproof Picasso\" mines the veins from party to pathos and keeps the Train comeback ride alive.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I can't stop listening to this album on my iPod. It's fun, energetic & addictive! Hair Mary Mallon consists of Aesop Rock, Rob Sonic & DJ Big Whiz & somehow they flew under the radar for me (I'm really into Underground Hip-Hop) but I am so glad that I discovered & sampled them on Amazon. I remember seeing the cover somewhere & I thought that it was a hardcore\/metal album so it got overlooked (don't judge a book by its cover). The beat selection is more electronic (think Run the Jewels) & is definately influenced by El-P. Aesop & Rob work so well together & these dudes can rhyme. I can't stress how much fun it is listening to this album. It's like audio dope for your ears. Do yourself a favor & check this album out now!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"There was certainly a lot to praise about Parlet's debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pleasure-Principle\/dp\/B00D6ZCTX2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pleasure Principle<\/a>. On the other hand it certainly didn't gain as much recognition as a lot of recognition that the somewhat more popularly focused P-Funk girl group Brides Of Funkenstein would. This entire idea of intense competition among the many satellite groups coming out from under the P-funk banner took an enormous toll on George Clinton's entire concept. And by the time Parlet were about to unleash it's second album in 1979, this became more than obvious. In addition to that newcomers Shirly Hayden and Janice Evans were just breaking into this chaotically conceived group. On the other hand,with further help from Ron Dunbar and a rather larger group of musicians playing on this album Parlet did gain a new and vital musical focus on this album that more than had the potential to push their momentum forward.\n\n  \"Ridin' High\"is actually my favorite Parlet number. It has one of the strongest dance-funk beats around,right on time horns and bass lines and a great hook exploring the songs themes of \"disco highs and disco lows\". \"No Rump To Bump\" continues the concept with a heavier Parliament type funk groove again-working a classic school yard taunt into the intro and refrains. \"Don't Ever Stop (Lovin' Me,Needin' Me)\" blends the vulnerable side of the sexual revolution that stands as an interesting contrast to the \"free from the need to be free\" Clinton attitude through a well arranged dance\/funk ballad. \"Booty Snatchers\" makes it clear P-Funk's outlook on the disco scene-to a stomping 4\/4 beat the albums concept is illustrated through a perception of disco dancers as \"body's who need bootys\". \"You're Leaving\" gets into some deep bluesy flavored funk-again exploring need in context of a human journey. \"Huff-N-Puff\" is a rocked out funk epic-using the Three Little Pigs concept of the liberated women dealing with hirsute male figures.\n\n  In a lot of ways this album betters Parlet's debut. Not only is the vocal mix quite a lot tougher, but the music-even the disco friendly aspects, are much higher on the funky groove quotient compared to the sleeker jazz influences of the previous album. Mojo magazine once proclaimed this to be Parlet at their best. And since they only recorded three albums in as many years, that is saying a lot. At that time anything from the P-Funk satellite groups were only to be found on vinyl and extremely difficult to locate. Luckily Real Gone Music has made this renowned and Iconic P-Funk album available for those in the digital age. And its worth hearing especially now. This album caught P-Funk and the funk era in general in an interesting transition as the 70's were about to spill over into the 80's. This was a time when many felt they would have no choice but to pimp the pleasure principle to gain creative and commercial recognition. And even at this point,both musically and lyrically,this album seemingly seeks out to try resolving these temporal conflicts within its own context.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Jim Croce was a singer\/songwriter\/guitarist from Philadelphia who burst onto the scene in the summer of 1973 with a #1 single \"You Don't Mess Around With Jim\".  Jim achieved his success the old fashioned way.  During the day he drove a truck and swung a hammer to support his young family and at night he played his music at bars and clubs all over Philly.  His first three singles all made the national Top 40 and in then in the spring of 1973 his 4th release \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\" would become his first #1 hit.  It appeared for all the world that Jim Croce was going to be a fixture on the American music scene for a very long time.  Here was an artist that the average Joe could relate to and root for.\n\nThen on September 20, 1973 tragedy struck.  Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in Natchitoches, LA.  He was just 30 years old.  Jim Croce had a backlog of unreleased material in the can and his label ABC continued to release a new single every few months.  His final Top Ten hit was released in February of 1974.  While I loved all of his singles I think \"I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song\" is my favorite.  The song spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart peaking at #9.  This is the original hit single recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Katharine McPhee's 2nd effort is a much-improved follow up to her self-titled debut disc.  I was pleasantly surprised upon listening to this album, as McPhee does a complete 180 here.\n\nGone are the made-for-radio Pop\/R&B\/Urban cuts & slick production of her debut.  'Unbroken' retains Pop-like characteristics, but tones down the production in favor of a quieter, more laid back sound.  McPhee trades in the glossy, candy coated tracks\/production for a throwback-sounding '50s\/'60s-inspired album (of course, throwing a cover song - the classic '60s novelty tune \"Brand New Key\" - into the mix doesn't hurt either; a smart move by McPhee\/her team.  Including that track [\"...Key\"] solidifies the retro vibe sprinkled throughout the album.\n\n...nice to see that there are a few more ballads on here as well, but not to the point where 'Unbroken' feels like a sob story or soap opera.  McPhee mixes it up with a variety of tracks, both uptempo & ballads.\n\nFavorite tracks:\n\n1. \"It's Not Right\" - favorite track!\n\n2. \"Had It All\" - fun melody(:\n\n11. \"Lifetime\" - sounds a little like Leona Lewis' \"Best You Never Had\".  Has a vintage-sounding vibe to it.\n\nOverall, McPhee's 2nd album is: nice, pretty, delicate, quiet, calming, relaxing, mellow, easy-listening.\n\n...Such a shame that this album didn't fair well commercially\/this album didn't get the recognition that it [& Katharine herself] deserve, as 'Unbroken' was a fresh (& much welcomed!) change :)\n\n-Chloe","classification":5,"fold":9}

Sure it's not very original, but it's at least fun for a small period of time. On it's own, the Kevin Rudolf part of the song gets 4-stars.\n\nHowever, like when Andy Dick walks into a room, when Lil' Wayne raps on a song, everybody seems to run out of the room screaming \"CRAP-ALEART!\" All those however forced to listen to the party killer are forced to endure annoying torture not seen since the days of \"MmmBop.\" Hopefully, if Barack has to dismantle Gitmo, he'll take Andy Dick, Lil' Wayne and \"MmmBop\" with it. Lil' Wayne = -2-stars.\n\nOverall, a potentially 4-star effort downgraded to 2-star, which is probably what the whole song would deserve in a month or two.

{"text":"For Gorillaz fourth album, Damon Albarn went New Wave by using mostly an iPad. This is an innovative idea that is not new, as in the late 70's and early 80's there were many other artists who did the same thing, just without the iPad. At first listen, \"The Fall\" seemed flat, with nothing interesting to offer. However, with repeated listening there are several good songs, but not enough to push this album past three and a half stars. The song titles do not match the lyrics for the most part, thus after repeated listens you might find yourself scratching your head as to which song was which.\n\n\"Revolving Doors\" and \"Bobby In Phoenix\" stand out while \"Little Pink Plastic Bags\", \"California & The Slipping Of The Sun\" and \"Seattle Yodel\" seem pointless. There a far more instrumental tracks on \"The Fall\" than any other Gorillaz album. This alters the feel of this Gorillaz album to where it's more like a chill-out album rather than the eclectic mix you've come to expect.\n\nSo, \"The Fall\" is for fans only. It won't win new fans, and it might alienate some fans. \"The Fall\" is an interesting idea that ultimately feels unfinished--snapshots and sketches of ideas that never seem to fully materialize.\n\nHere is how \"The Fall\" compares with previous Gorillaz work:\n\n2001 Gorillaz: Three and a Half Stars\n2002 G-Sides: Three Stars\n2005 Demon Days: Four Stars\n2007 D-Sides: Three and a Half Stars\n2010 Plastic Beach: Four and a Half Stars\n2011 The Fall: Three and a Half Stars","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"The title was taken from the bumping track \"Front, Back, & Side To Side\". I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day. Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK, except for a few songs here and there. Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job, because I told them that I'm from the A, their recent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Underground-Kingz\/dp\/B000K7UFL2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Underground Kingz<\/a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned. So I ended up buying this the very next day.\n\nSuper Tight is a very southern style album. Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in '94, than they do today. A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then. \"It's Supposed To Bubble\" is one of them. Bun B drops a solo track \"Feds In Town\" which sounds real good. \"Pocket Full Of Stones 2\" and \"Protect & Serve\" are other good songs. \"Stoned Junkee\" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3-2. The final track \"Three Sixteens\" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album.\n\nSuper Tight is an excellent album. Some of the production sounds dated (although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production), but it still bumps here today. It's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar, especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\/dp\/B0000013GB\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Diary\/dp\/B000000W6Z\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Diary<\/a>&nbsp;dropped the same year. But if you're a fan of 90's southern rap (mainly groups like E.S.G., UGK, or anyone from Rap-A-Lot), don't hesitate to get this album. I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ('00-'04), and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas.

{"text":"\"Zipper Catches Skin\" may be the most unbalanced Cooper disk recorded. It has some fantastic songs like \"Tag, You're It\", a tribute to 80's slasher films in which Alice sings as if directing a B-Movie. \"Adaptable\" is a really fun song that will stay in your head after just one listen to the album. And you have \"I Like Girls\" and \"Remarkably Insincere\" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser. \"I Am the Future\" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album. But, on the flip side you have what may be Cooper's worst song ever with \"No Baloney Homosapiens\". I am sure at the time, Cooper thought this was pretty clever, but musically it just does not flow, the lyrics are choppy, and forced into a rhyming scheme that just doesn't work. \"Make That Money\" is another forgettable ditty, with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper. But outside of those two songs Alice I think \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is a really good album, but still the weakest of the early 80's New Age Alice. I prefer \"Flush the Fashion\", \"Special Forces\" and the best of this era \"DaDa\". Still, it's Alice Cooper and worth the price for the import, if for nothing else than to own the entire Cooper Collection.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"It is so surprisingly that Justin Timberlake has made some really good songs after he had left N'Sync. Honestly, there are some that had been a little overplayed like Sexyback and others that have been more underrated like Not A Bad Thing. But when he came back to making music after a few years away from the public eye, he really had to find himself all over again, as a character actor, and trying to find Mrs. Right. Which he actually did when he married Jessica Biel, after having a set of numerous gal pals from Britney Spears, Cameron Diaz, and others to have close relationships. But he has been making some really good songs after he came back from the hiatus. I just heard his latest song, Can't Stop The Feeling, and honestly the song is pretty good, after a set of songs that really had been both good like Suit & Tie, and others that haven't liked up to the hype, like the Luther Vandross sampled Take Back The Night and TKO overall. His song from the Trolls is actually better than what has been out there from products like Rihanna and Beyonce', whom had been all hype, no heart. Hopefully, Justin can really keep up the pace, and make more good songs like this one.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Nearly 40 years on since its debut Dreamboat Annie, this Heart may never need a pacemaker, if Fanatic is any indicator.  Led by a guitar riff choked with percussive crunch, Ann Wilson kicks off the title track with demands:  Dont try to tell me the world is changing \/ hearts getting stupid \/ that is a strange thing, leaving the listener no doubt that Heart is still hot.  Dear Old America follows, lulling with pleasant strings, only to blow open into a levee-breaking Led-Zeppelin sound-alike that erupts into a double-time race in the songs middle.  Walkin Good, a country-ish trifle with Sarah McLachlan, leads into the Jack-White-like blues of Skin and Bones.  Then the album takes a left  a brand-new sound for Heart, as layers of delayed guitars ping-pong off one another in an Edge-y rhythm that percolates and bubbles beneath Anns wail on A Million Miles.  While producer Ben Mink may have deliberately dirtied many of the guitar tracks, Nancy Wilson still provides beautiful finger-picked figures when needed (e.g., Rock Deep (Vancouver).  Theres really just one weakness to Fanatic, but its minor:  the songwriting itself doesnt seem quite as strong.  The riffs may pound you silly (59 Crunch), but fewer songs match with a memorable melody.  Still, nineteen albums ago, Dreamboat Annie wasn't making waves, either.  Given time, Fanatic may convert you again.  Just don't miss A Million Miles.","classification":4,"fold":9}

It's supposed to be \"country\", but has a pop element in addition to a little orchestral flourish toward the middle to the end. For fans of the show \"Nashville\", this has got to be a favorite, as Juliette's character is at the height of maturity and strength while singing this, and simultaneously through the lyrics- revealing how vulnerable and devastated she is. For someone who has never seen the show; listen to this song! And the rest of the soundtrack. I was never a fan of contemporary country, but this music is better than what I hear on the radio. It's almost a shame that a song this good was relegated to a tv show, although associating it with a character whose story you know makes it that much better. She's singing about her mother, and the great universally relatable thing about this song is the lyrics work for anyone who's ever had their heartbroken in any sense.

{"text":"Its been a long time since I found an album that is such a polar opposite of itself.  It wouldnt even be fair to call this album all over the place so much that it bounces back and forth between some very good and some very bad songs, with a couple of middle of the road songs thrown in.\n\nThe album starts off with promise with the title track, Black.  Its a good song and reminds me a bit, thematically, of Bentleys early hit, Come a Little Closer.\n\nPick Up, by its title alone, conjures that this song is about to be about a pickup trick.  However, a pickup truck is only mentioned in passing in the chorus (and theres no indication that its jacked up, either).  The song begs a lover to pick up the pieces, to pick up where the couple left off, to pick up the phone and to show some kind of emotion, love or hate, and not leave the singer hanging on wondering whats going on.  I actually really liked this song.\n\nIll Be the Moon is a duet with Maren Morris and is another strong offering.\n\nIts after this, however when the album begins to show signs of wavering..  First, Ill admit that What The Hell Did I Say may be my guilty pleasure on the album.  Admittedly, its not a good song and I wouldnt want to see it as a single, but Bentleys charismatic and enjoyable delivery prevent me from outright hating it (much like with Drunk on a Plane).\n\nSomewhere On a Beach is awful.  Many people hoped this song was just Bentley playing the game: releasing a radio friendly single to pave the way for an otherwise strong album.  Unfortunately, the song is not an anomaly on the album: Mardi Gras is exactly what youd expect from a song of that title,  Roses and a Time Machine takes a promising concept and some decent lyrics and wastes its potential: sonically it doesnt work.  It has aspects that could work: in fact, if done right, it should have worked as an up-tempo song, but added unnecessary pomp and circumstance turn it into a mediocre song, at best.\n\nThat doesnt end the albums different ends of the spectrum, though.  Before you know it, Bentley is back with another strong offering, Different For Girls.  The album also closes with another two strong songs: Light It Up and Cant Be Replaced.  Cant Be Replaced, along with Ill Be the Moon, is a favorite of mine on the album.  Its a very mature and relatable song.  Anyone whos ever experienced any significant changes in their life will be able to connect with this song: it took me back to college days at my fraternity house and the good times I shared with great friends: no matter how many times I go back and visit, those times cannot be recreated or replaced.\n\nI wanted to like this album a lot more than I did.  Bentley is capable of so much better than the album he offered.  The album is far from terrible: it has some really strong moments.  It just should have had a lot more strong moments and a lot less songs readily created for country radio.  Itd be hard to accuse Bentley of completely selling out, but I did expect a lot more from him.\n\n2.5\/5 stars.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"There is no denying Wolfmother.  Mike Patton of Faith No More ridiculed them as I mentioned on other Wolfmother\/Stockdale solo CD's, but frankly, I didn't ask Mike Patton and really don't give a s*** what he thinks.  \"Victorious\" is the fourth CD from a fine classic oriented but fresh true hard rock and roll band in the vein of the classic rockers, echoing just about everybody from the late '60's and early '70's without being a rip off of any of them.\n  Stockdale, the leader of the band has often stated that he was influenced by the best rock music of the aforementioned era, and I concur that no time in rock and roll history had the variety, totally independent styles and approaches as the time from the Beatles to the early 1980's.  This is because up until then, record companies often were clueless to what the \"kids\" listened to, competition was fierce, and frankly, rock fans demanded a lot more from their favorite bands and performers than the simple minded hip mentality does today, settling for so little in the name of style as opposed to quality.\n  We can be glad Stockdale is delightfully ensconced in the heavy rock and roll ideology.  \"Victorious\" is a riff crazy rock and roll album, full of the energy and references to a time in music history that he understands.  While I remain stubborn and consider the debut the best Wolfmother album, there really is no reason not to have their music.  I do think the production could have been a bit ballsier, and compared to the other CD's, it's a bit short and could have used another killer rocker or two, hence the one star deduction, but it's still damn good rock and roll, as is the solo LP Andrew Stockdale released a few years ago.

Not only has she really delivered with each and every album, but her voice really has ignited in the way that divas have done before like the great Whitney Houston or British legendary divas like Dusty Springfield. When she came out with 21, she really ignited a fire that really has been more authentic than the joke divas name Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, because she has had altogether the voice, and the songs to match at the heart and soul that work better than met the eye. When Adele released 21, she made everyone listen because she had a great set of songs at the heart, and Someone Like You, the second single from the album is no exception. The song is really one that ignites from the soul and the mood. Adele really delivers with each and every withering note of the song, and it does not get tiring or overplayed, unlike product divas like Nicki Minaj or Britney Spears.

{"text":"It was surprising to me that I saw this album in my local music store without hearing a song on the radio, or hearing one word mentioned about its release.  I wondered how that could be, when I considered \"No Name Face\" one of the best 25 albums of all-time.\nAnyway, this album is good.  It's no \"No Name Face\", but it's good.  I wish I could say it was great, but I can't.  There's too many holes in the album, and too many weak songs.  But there are a good number of quality songs, and a few very good ones, including \"Spin\", \"Wash\", \"Am I Ever Gonna Find Out\", and \"Just Another Name\".\nThe only major problem I have with this album is track number 7, called \"Out of Breath\".  This song sounds identical to \"Hanging by a Moment\" in every way.  The music is almost karaoke.  I can't understand why Lifehouse would make a song sound identical to their only smash hit song.\nAll in all, a good effort from Lifehouse, but something was missing here.  It's like a jigsaw puzzle with a few pieces missing.  It just isn't complete.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"And I should know because I was 12 that year and music was great! Let me think...\"Brothers In Arms\", \"Dream Into Action\", \"Be Yourself Tonight\", \"The Head On The Door\", \"Little Creatures\", \"Nervous Night\", \"No Jacket Required\", \"Afterburner\", \"Knee Deep In The Hoopla\", \"Once Upon A Time\", \"Here's To Future Days\", \"Welcome To The Real World\", \"Around The World In A Day\", \"The Dream Of The Blue Turtles\", \"How To Be A Zillionaire\", \"To Live And Die In L.A.\", \"Fables Of The Reconstruction\", \"Hunting High And Low\", \"Whitney Houston\", \"Mike + The Mechanics\", \"Heart\", \"Silvertone\", \"Play Deep\", \"Astra\", \"Tao\", \"Southern Accents\" and the list goes on and on and on. But I digress...\n\nBack in 2009 when Passion Pit (which is essentially 28 year old Michael Angelakos) released their debut, \"Manners\", they were a blast from my past. You see, I grew up with New Wave\/Dance music from the 1980's, and Passion Pit is definitely a child born from that era (heck, Michael Angelakos was born in 1987). \"Manners\" remains the best album from Passion Pit. There has been something missing ever since then. I couldn't tell you what it is exactly, but 2012's \"Gossamer\" was just slightly less exuberant, and now 2015's \"Kindred\" is just slightly less than \"Gossamer\".\n\nAt first listen, \"Kindred\" hits you like an excited preschooler, running up to you, grabbing your attention, keeping you dazed as you try and figure out what they're saying to you. Then, as you begin to relax, and re-listen to \"Kindred\", the music starts to slightly annoy. I don't know if it's the high pitched vocals or the overzealous keyboard swaths throughout the album.\n\nThere are some good songs here like \"Lifted Up (1985)\", \"All I Want\", \"Five Foot Ten (I)\", and \"Until We Can't (Let's Go)\". There are other tracks that, after repeatedly listening, just become bothersome like \"Whole Life Story\", \"Where The Sky Hangs\" (talk about 80's sounding!), \"Dancing On The Grave\", \"Looks Like Rain\" and \"My Brother Taught Me How To Swim\". By far, the most obnoxious track here (and it really didn't need to be here) is \"Five Foot Ten (II)\". That is a quintessentially annoying track that you should just skip over.\n\nI get the feeling that Michael Angelakos really put a large portion of himself into these songs, not just from a musician's standpoint, or a producer's standpoint, but from a writer's standpoint. One look over the lyrics and you can tell they're personal (not general). The problem with \"Kindred\" is, to make a mental health analogy, like being with someone who is in the manic state of bipolar disorder--it's all high energy and ebullience, and removed from the sobriety of reality. Like a party without end (but with semi-serious lyrics--because, let's face it, I've heard personal music, and artists such as Tori Amos, John Mellencamp, Fiona Apple, and even Madonna, write very personal songs that somehow hold up better than what you will find on \"Kindred\". There's a lot of relationship songs and mental health songs, but they don't quite reach a broader audience.\n\nAll this being said, Passion Pit is surely a band with a great deal of potential. After three albums, the focus should be on song craft, and making an album that is rock solid, with a variety of sounds. I understand Passion Pit is classified as \"Indietronica\", what ever the hell that means, but even working within the confines of that musical label you can still make a landmark recording (just look at \"The Downward Spiral\", \"Touch\", \"Boomerang\", \"Chorus\", \"Technique\", \"Dream Into Action\", \"The Flat Earth\", \"Heartbeat City\", \"Kick\", \"Man Of Colours\", \"Disintegration\" and \"Violator\". All done with a heavy use of electronics, if not entirely electronic albums.\n\nHere's how \"Kindred\" compares to Passion Pit's previous works:\n\n2009 Manners: Four and a Half Stars\n2012 Gossamer: Four Stars\n2015 Kindred: Three and a Half Stars","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Jimi Hendrix took this Bob Dylan tune and turned it into his own monumentally panoramically spaghetti westernly classic. Brian Jones on the vibraslap at the end of each opening bar, makes me think of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef calmly sizing each other up in some dusty lawless town. I never knew Brian Jones played on this, what a bittersweet discovery. Wow, Dave Mason too? Argghhh, can't believe I didn't know this...well, glad to know it now.\n\nThe story unfolds....the joker speaks to the thief about his troubles. The blues. Life is a drag. He finishes his words at 0:52 and Jimi cranks out a nice solo in solidarity. At 1:09, the thief 'kindly' speaks. He can sympathize and says there are 'many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.' But he says, let's not talk about this tonight, it's getting late.\n\n1:43 - so the joker and thief wander off into the night, Jimi blazing a trail for them to follow. At 2:00 they fall asleep and are swept off into some sort of dream land (my favorite part). At 2:17 they wake from their slumber and realize they aren't quite sure where they are. A wah wah chaos of tumbleweeds and dust encircles them as they attempt to get their situation in order. 2:33 - back on some trail, with a growing sense of urgency.\n\n2:50 - The joker and the thief have traveled over distance and time, and now out of nowhere they approach a fortress of princes, damsels, servants, possibly various other court attendants, who may have been aware of them for awhile, observing them from the watchtower. But they are not there yet. They must deal with growling wildcats and howling winds. I've always preferred a happy ending - they finally make it to the castle and are welcomed with hearty meals and bowls of mead.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I own most of Jaheim's music and this man never releases a bad album.  When he records an LP, he obviously brings his A-game because one can hear it in his voice: He is focused when he sings and he means every word he belts out.  He is one of the best male artists of today, easily.  Why?  Foremost, because he has a beautiful tenor singing voice and knows just how to use it.  He does not over-sing and he stays on key so well!  \"The Makings of A Man\" is one of the best albums of 2007 because it is consistent and there are some great tunes on this album.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo and about women and relationships.  Also, there are twelve songs so the album is not too short and not lengthy either.\n\n Jaheim will find some way to tell you that he is a reformed thug on each and every album.  I know he is serious, but it's a little funny that he feels the need to continually remind us.  This time, his thug story is found on \"Life of A Thug.\"  He exposes some of the malicious things he did during that juncture in his life, and if you listen closely, he was a pretty bad guy.  This song is nicely produced; I particularly like the horns.  Also, the hook gives it replay value.  \"She Ain't You\" and \"Voice of R&B\" are great tracks.  Vocally, he does a splendid job.  The lyrics are meaningful, especially to Jaheim fanatics.  He informs his listeners that he is very important to the genre of music called R&B, and he is.  Keyshia Cole is my boo and she did well on \"I've Changed\", but that is one of the weakest songs on the album.  The song is average at best.  The hook isn't too good and neither are the lyrics or the production.  Jaheim has included quite a few songs about his mother on his albums.  Here, we have a song called \"Back Together Again.\"  This heartfelt number has an emotional Jaheim singing about how his parents are united in heaven.  It's a lovely moment on the album.\n\n I hope I have convinced you to pick this album up, download it from iTunes, do SOMETHING!  I enjoyed it all the way through.  Be advised, this is a laid back album.  There aren't any dance tracks, just ballads and mid-tempos, but truly worth your time.  4 shining stars.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Just Don't Have a Clue\"\n2. \"Back Together Again\"\n3. \"Life of a Thug\"\n4. \"What You Think of That\"\n5. \"Lonely\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Natasha Bedingfield has shown herself to be a very savvy pop artist.  When her second CD (\"N.B.\") underperformed critically and commercially in Europe, she scrapped its planned U.S. release and quickly recorded a new CD (\"Pocketful of Sunshine\") that she thought would do better.  The first two singles from that new CD fit seamlessly into current American pop radio: \"Love Like This\" peaked at #11 and \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" went all the way to #5.  The third single, \"Angel,\" is a beautiful ballad-tinged song likely to become a big U.S. hit.\n\n\"Angel\" is a bit more R&B leaning than her usual single; producer Darkchild has produced numerous hits for R&B artists like Destiny's Child, Mary J. Blige, Pussycat Dolls, and Beyonce.  The single starts as an atmospheric piano-driven jam, somewhat reminiscent of Nelly Furtado's \"Say It Right.\"  The song becomes progressively more up-tempo, culminating in a rap-style bridge by Natasha.  What I like most about the song is that the production sounds so current yet it really incorporates Natasha's style as well - she sounds really great vocally here.  A real winner that likely will vie for the top 10.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"When it has came down to girl groups, there aren't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within. Musically, it has been much harder to see one that will ignite afire in the way that groups like En Vogue and Destiny's Child had been able to do the past few generations. When Fifth Harmony came out the past few years, I honestly was not very thrilled at the songs that they had been able too come out with in heart and soul. I was not excited of the songs Sledgehammer and Worth It, which showed the gals were not very strong at the soul, and sounded more like they were little children at the mike for the first time than divas at the heart. Their latest single from their second album 7\/27, tries to bring in more of a reggae feeling to their songs, but it didn't work overall. All In My Head (Flex) their latest single, doesn't actually deliver at the heart of the matter to what they really could've deliver, as a more sultry and seductive song to turn to the kids, into sultry songstresses. I really was not very impressed with the song, and hopefully, when the gals grow further into their music, Fifth Harmony will have much more down the road to sing about.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"For Katy Perry, over the top is just the tip of the iceberg, from her original\/strange lyrics, to her outrageous outfits\/stage presence, she's truly an original figure. It's this strange newness that turns you off at first, but eventually it'll overtake you i.e. Hot N' Cold. Waking Up In Vegas is lyrically original, has a great melody taking a building up approach, and the song is possibly even more catchy then any of her previous singles. \"Shut up and put your money where your mouth is, that's what you get for waking up in Vegas. Get up and shake the glitter of your shoulders...\" It's crazy...\n\nOverall, this song should not stay in Vegas, and could be Perry's best effort thus far. Still not amazing, but good enough for your iPod.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Unique to \"Killer Queen\" is how is lifted Queen up as a bad in a new place in rock.\n\nWith this song, they became more than a rock band. They were now art rock, classic rock, opera rock, and more. You'll find a touch of lounge, harmonies, a great solo by Brian May, tight drumming by Roger Taylor, and everything else you'd expect in a Queen tune.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Quarterflash was formed in Oregon in 1980. The singer and sax player is Rindy Ross, wife of Marv Ross, guitarist. What makes this band different is the fact that the front vocalist also plays the saxophone. Rindy stated at one time that she uses the saxophone as an extension of her voice enabling her to put more feeling and emotion to a given song which her voice alone, in her opinion, would not be able to achieve. The self-titled album was released in the latter part of 1981. Almost a year later it went Platinum, meaning more than a Million copies sold. This song is performed impeccably, very well arranged and executed. It is a true classic of the '80s. I like this song very much. Their other songs are not bad either, but this is the tune that put Quarterflash to a #7 slot in the charts. The MP3 sound quality is better than what I had expected.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"When North Carolina based Rapsody made her debut several years back, she was originally a member of the collective Kooley High. It was there she first worked with 9th Wonder, where he would invite her to appear on the interludes to his sophomore album \"The Dream Merchant, Volume 2\". When 2010 rolled around, she released her first mixtape \"Return Of The B-Girl\". The following year, she emerged with two more mixtapes- \"Thank H.E.R. Now\" and \"For Everything\" as well as the EP \"The Black Mamba\". At this point in time, she was dangerously close to signing a recording contract with Def Jam, but things stalled to a screeching halt and she went back to being independent. 2012 saw the release of her formal debut on 9th Wonder's label It's A Wonderful World Music Group with \"The Idea Of Beautiful\". It's an album that shows she was cut from the same cloth as earlier female rappers like MC Lyte, Bahamadia and Jean Grae.\n\nNot much has changed for her in terms of style and sound- in fact, her album picks up where her mixtapes left off. She reunites with the production team The Soul Council, who has produced virtually everything she's done since she embarked on a solo career. Opening up the album is the aptly titled \"Motivation\" which features a treademark opening monologue from Big Rube of the Dungeon Family. She teams up again with her labelmate Heather Victoria on the jazzy feel of \"The Drums\", where she explains on how people relate to personal lyrics in music. She talks openly about love and relationships on \"Precious Wings\" and \"Good Good Love\". She criticizes the music industry on the first single \"Believe Me\" and wishes to meet her idol Jay-Z on \"Destiny\". Rapsody talks of a sad story of young girl's downward spiral on \"In The Town\" and thanks everyone who supported her during her humble beginnings on \"When I Have You\". She collaborates with Raheem DeVaughn and Black Hippy's Ab-Soul on \"Non-Fiction\" and teams up again with Mac Miller and The Cool Kids on \"Round Table Discussion\". Rapsody's \"The Idea Of Beautiful\" is a great debut outing from the critically acclaimed female rapper. While the album is rather lengthy, it's a great listen from beginning to end.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Having slow-cooked a career built on massive hooks, anthemic choruses, top-shelf production and the charismatic presence of frontlady Emily Haines, Metric very well could have kept producing slight variations of their established formula and been just fine for another decade or so. But just like any band who makes it six albums into its career, the band have decided to tinker with the sound that endeared them to so many to begin with. Call it boredom. Call it chasing a muse. Any artist worth their salt needs to stretch its legs every once in a while, and lo and behold, the men (and lady) in Metric have reached that point themselves.\n\nOn \"Pagans in Vegas,\" Metric double-down on the new-wave leanings of 2012's \"Synethica\" with unfortunately diminishing returns. What the band gains in lusher soundscapes and a broader scope, it loses in punchiness. The songwriting feels sterile and alien, with typically charming Haines sounding oddly removed from the rest of the band. There are still flashes of \"old\" Metric to be found. \"The Shade\" and \"Celebrate\" in particular feel like a natural progression, while for better or worse, \"Too Bad, So Sad\" fits alongside previous single \"Lost Kitten.\" But so much of the album feels stuck in the middle, as if the band themselves are going through a mid-career crisis. The closing pair of tracks -- \"The Face Part I & II\" -- gain some traction while breaking new ground. Unfortunately, these nice, subdued instrumentals with minimal vocals are too little too late. By the time the album wraps up, it leaves one feeling like they've consumed empty musical calories.\n\nIt's not that \"Pagans in Vegas\" is a bad album, per se. But the most damning compliment one could offer would be that it makes perfectly fine background music. But that's not what Metric is about. Their music is meant to be big and bold, to stand out from the crowd and command your attention. History tells us that this is likely just a detour in Metric's career, one that will make the next release that much more satisfying. But in the meantime, it's a bit of a bummer to find Metric as we know them to be missing in action.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Radiohead never follows expectations, whatever that could even look like given their varied career path. Post Kid A, most of what they've released has been a challenge to get into, not immediately likeable the first brush through. Moon Shaped Pool is no different in that regard. I've taken nearly a week to digest and form an opinion. Bottom line, it's a rare work of brilliance.\n\nThe lead song Burn the Witch kicks off with what could almost pass as the beginning of an Enya song, skidaddles around for a bit, then lands on Thom Yorke's beautifully hypnotic chorus. Then it closes off with an eerie Hitchcockian string crescendo. Witch is an impressive work among their best. And a great kick-off for the rest of the album.\n\nPool plays out like an intricate puzzle of sounds ranging from orchestras, choral arrangements, mumbled yet soaring melodies, random echoes and reverb, and impressive guitar work (Infinikit the real culminating highlight).  It feels like a tour through the dreamland that is Radiohead's infinite imagination.\n\nFor my personal tastes, Pool is their most important work since Kid A. Far more accessible than the aforementioned, yes, but also worth revisiting in the same way Kid A and Ok Computer were. There's much to absorb and dissect and taste again and again here, and I'm thrilled with Radiohead in a renewed way.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs \"Smoke\" and \"Fade Away\". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard \"Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.\nI did appreciate \"Just Fine\" a little more than when I did initially. \"Grown Woman\" I love and \"Work that\" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After \"Just Fine\" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher \"Shake down\" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The latest from the Bach Guild series is a reprise of one of its most popular offerings - an all-new, chock-full of never before available recordings Big Box, doing what we do best. We proudly present The Big Baroque Box, Volume 2. (We can vouch for the fact that the music is better than the title.)\n\nThis box is great for a number of reasons. This set combines all the aspects that you love about The Bach Guild's .99 Big Bach Set series. And they are:\n\n  We revive long out of print, highly supportable and unjustifiably forgotten recordings, at a great price.\n\n  We create a fantastic, multi-hour listening experience, at a great price.\n\n  We pay homage to the \"DNA\" of the Bach Guild, at a great price.\n\nOur last releases, the Big Great Symphonies Box Volumes 1 & 2 ruffled a few feathers because it included quite a bit of material that had been released on other Big Boxes. This time, The Big Baroque Box, Volume 2 is comprised of almost all never-before-released-to-digital materials - just an hour or so of this set was ever previously available in the digital realm- and then we heap on unreleased recordings like toppings at the frozen yogurt stand.\n\nAs we've said in the past, The Bach Guild was started as a devotion to the master of the baroque era, and the label quickly morphed into a leader in making recordings featuring the pioneers of the new \"historically informed performance\" movement. And so most of these recordings demonstrate those principles. Even someone who might quibble with the inclusion of the recordings of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra should know these recordings represented the US recording debut of the works presented here.\n\nBut if it's baroque and The Bach Guild, you'll discover some unforgettable moments. A quick list: two hard to find Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Concentus Musicus Wien recitals, two exceptional recitals by harpsichordist Anton Heiller and a treasure trove of lost recordings (three LPs worth) by Edmond de Stoutz, featuring concertos of Tartini and music once attributed to Pergolesi (as it was on the original Bach Guild LP). Of course, we can finally release the last of three recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos, this time performed and conducted by Josef Suk and his chamber orchestra.\n\nAnd for the first timer, we've liberally mixed in some of the baroque ear candy that is very familiar - the Mouret Fanfare, the Albinoni Adagio for Strings, and Gluck's Dance of the Blessed Spirits...and we've put them right up front, where you can either listen to them first and most often, or skip them entirely and move on to the juicy bits that the baroque music student will truly savor.\n\nWe also included one real goody for the fans of Bach Guild\/Vanguard Classics. A famous 2 LP set featuring the baroque and renaissance instruments, narrated by New York classical radio legend Martin Bookspan, is included here - available digitally for the first time. A limited release of the recording on CD sold very well, indicating the fond memories that many collectors had for this fine guide to the styles and performance practices of the renaissance and baroque era.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"If this is indeed the last Pink Floyd release of new (sort of) music, then Gilmour and Mason have gone out in style. It's 98% instrumental, and reminiscent of their very early work in movie soundtracks and extended instrumental breaks in classic songs such as Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Echoes. The music is leftover from the Division Bell sessions with more recent overdubs.\n\nI hesitate to call this ambient music because ambient music doesn't hold my attention like this does. It's interesting ambient music that ebbs and flows enough to catch your ear. It's certainly not for the casual PF fan. If The Wall is all you know about Pink Floyd, you probably won't like this. But if you are familiar with PF's output between the Syd Barrett era and Dark Side Of The Moon, you will certainly understand.  Even the song titles harken back to an earlier time. The songs are titled as \"sides\" like the sides of a vinyl LP, with names for individual movements.\n\nThe only true vocals are found on the final movement, Louder Than Words. The title itself sums up the entire album. The lyrics were written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson. While it will never be regarded as an essential Floyd cut, thematically it sums up the album quite well.\n\nTotally unexpected, but once you hear it, it's a fitting tribute to the late Richard Wright and a fitting end to Pink Floyd.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Shown as Progressive Metal, in your ears vocal over clean rocking band. Guitar licks and old style harmonic vocals very nice.\n\nRunning For cover by Dimage. Another defunct band playing classic heavy rock song. Clean semi-soaring vocal over subdued rocking band. Nice, sounds dated.\n\nThis Unholy War by Forte (acute accent over the e). Great high speed hard rock song with clean vocal over thrash & faster band. Nice.\n\nUp From Beneath by Uncle Slam. Defunct thrash metal band playing tight neat song w\/punk roots. Great speed guitar play and vocal, 5 minute song rocks.\n\nTrack 6. The Secret by Confessor. Nice Doom metal opening, shrill vocal over same play, nothing fancy.\n\nDown The Drain by Cyclone Temple. Defunct Trash Metal band, wordy vocal, band mostly in the background until their instrumental interlude which rocks, they sound great. Good song.\n\nDon't Talk About Love by Casanova. Sounding very familiar this song rocks as a 90's rock song which it is. Great strong & some screaming vocal over excellent band. Classic hard rock song, love it.\n\nTransmogrified by Solstice. Death Metal track that rocks. Speed play, guttural vocal, busy band & song. Song rules.\n\nInspired Hatred by Elysium. Melodic Death Metal is the band's tag, this song rocks & slows sounding cutting edge and then jaded in the same song. Thrash metal roots, repeated riffs, soaring guitar, & then more. I love it then I love it less, 6 minutes. Like it.\n\nDementia By Design from Forte (same e). Brilliant speed metal (or Thrash Metal) song, soaring vocal, fast guitar playing more, slows to breath then zooms. Love it.\n\nParadise by Line of Fire. Soaring vocal, guitar and rocking band bring to mind Journey w\/o Mr Perry taking all the limelight. Excellent song, superior vocal, great band.\n\nResurrected by Dominance. Reminds me of early Atari Teenage Riot. Chatty vocal and spoken words that never sound good after a few plays. Nevertheless, classic Thrash metal play, 5 minutes.\n\nWorld War Three (Crack Party Weekend). Similar to previous track, intense high speed play (very ATR like) political lyrics, rocking band, drums & noise.\n\nReunion by Widow. Great old style hard rock song, Iron Maiden\/Judas Priest-like, cool guitar rocking song, great vocals love it.\n\nVictimize by Fly Machine. Progressive Metal song that stumbles along, jerky play and uneven vocal, you may love it.\n\nFinal track Witches & Warlocks by Oracle. Long gone heavy metal band playing classic metal track. Clean vocal above strong pounding band. Heavy and safe.\n\nReleased in October 2011, nudged into and immediately dropped out of the Amazon Top 100 Free mp3 downloads this week, this sampler from Divebomb Records hard rocks.\nDivebomb Records is the division of Tribunal Records used to reissue old material. This sampler has been released to highlight nearly every band on this sampler has a release of old, many remastered songs and entire albums due out.

Then before you know it,you're singing along with it. Wonderful song brings back happy times of years ago. Get your copy now!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"You'll laugh!  You'll cry!  You'll sing along!  \"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\" is a good reason why writer's strikes should occur more often.\n\nJoss Whedon, creator of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Firefly\" and various other cult favorites, drafted up this little gem while on hiatus during the writer's strike.  Even if you're not a fan of Whedon's, the songs are insanely catchy and Neil Patrick Harris is awesome as always as the title character a.k.a. \"Billy\".\n\nNathan Fillion stars as Captain Hammer, Dr. Horrible's nemesis.  He will stop at nothing to annoy Dr. Horrible, from thwarting his evil plans to trying to steal the girl of his dreams, Penny, (Felicia Day).  Penny spends her time trying to get people to sign a petition to help the homeless.  Dr. Horrible's main goal is just the opposite, of course: to get into the Evil League of Evil.  And to possibly hook up with Penny somehow in the process.\n\nDr. Horrible spends his days working on a device that will help him bring down Captain Hammer for good, which will hopefully also gain him entrance into the ELE at the same time.  He also spends a lot of time in the laundromat, washing his clothes but really trying to chat up Penny.  The jokes in this film are golden, like when Penny tells Billy that Captain Hammer is on his way over to the laundromat and Billy looks at his wrist where his watch should be and exclaims, \"wow, look at my wrist!  I've gotta go!\"  Another great moment is when Captain Hammer clarifies for Billy just what the \"Hammer\" in his name actually is.\n\nDr. Horrible will stop at nothing to be in the ELE.  But will it cost him in the end?  And what will become of Captain Hammer?  Will Dr. Horrible finally have his victory?\n\nBecause this is a \"sing-along blog\", the soundtrack would have to be something of mention...and it is.\n\n\"My Eyes\" is a very strong track.  If you have never heard NPH do Broadway or sing at all, you will be blown away by his vocal talents in this strong.  Day has a pretty voice, but it's a bit flat and kind of reminds you of the girl who sings the \"Portal\" theme song.\n\n\"Brand New Day\" is another great song.  Captain Hammer has just whisked Penny away and Dr. Horrible sings about how he will destroy him.\n\n\"My Freeze Ray\" is very cute.  Billy sings about how he'll stop the world with his freeze ray and make Penny fall in love with him.\n\n \"Everyone's a Hero\", Captain Hammer's solo, is a bit annoying but that's probably because his character is supposed to be irritating.\n\n\"So They Say\" is a comical track--you will be singing \"we do the weird stuff!\" for a while after hearing this.\n\n\"Slipping\" and \"Everything You Ever\" are touching, resonating tracks, especially the latter.\n\nTo avoid possible spoilers though, you should probably check out the film before listening to the soundtrack.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Billed as Bjork's \"break-up record\", \"Vulnicura\" leaves little to speculate. The cover image of Bjork with a gaping chest wound, provides a visual representation of the album's thematology. As for the curious title, when broken down, the latin words \"vulnus\" and \"cura\" respectively translate to \"injury\" and \"healing\". Though hardly a novel concept, Bjork takes this personal and introspective matter, and skillfully renders it universal, by creating an album in which to find solace, despite its heartbreaking content. After a long period of philosophical (and often pretty inaccessible) albums, she returns with the most human-centered album of her career, which, to those familiar with her work, is some kind of apocalypse. Especially, when considering that the record leaked, and was rush-released, a fact that seems to have done Bjork an inadvertent service, thus, allowing listeners to focus purely on the actual material. The album's 9 songs, chronicling the story of a relationship, are almost inextricably linked with one another. However, special mention has to be made for the album's glorious centrepiece, \"Black lake\", and the dramatic opener \"Stonemilker\". Reaching further than ever before, with \"Vulnicura\", Bjork proves that she is a phenomenal artist: wacky, weird, wondrous, wonderful.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"50 Cent's flagship team, G-Unit, is back after releasing 2014's The Beauty Of Independence EP, the group's first release since 2008's Terminate On Sight LP. Ironically, 50 hardly even appears on this The Beast Is G-Unit EP, aside from one: a wooing autotune bit opening the introductory \"Ballin,\" and two: the chorus of \"Boy Boy.\" G-Unit's six year hiatus proved their best marketing tool for The Beauty Of Independence, which overall performed well. The guys were gallantly back on their gangsta schtick with some renewed and newfound spirit. The same is true for The Beast Is G-Unit, except this one suffers the fate of coming after Beauty.\n\nIn relation to before, the repetition in content includes the gangsterism, pimping, worship of big boy toys, and various other infractions of the law that the five-piece crew commit on this round's excursion. The mostly-complete gang of Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Kidd Kidd (50 Cent barely contributes) are satisfactorily lyrical for the most part, relegating their gifts to street life matters and proving to fans that they can still band-up after all these years. Notwithstanding that fact, Lloyd Banks, out of all the members, gives the EP the brightest signs of lyrical virtuosity, throwing in different rhythms and tempos and basically just showing the most free-spirited character of any in the bunch.\n\nAside from needing to be there and appealing to a new class of hip hop listeners, the beats walk a thin line between relevancy and redundancy, harnessing the nervous, temporal energy of drill- ticks and a few sounds from G-Unit's past, i.e., organ, wavering electric guitar and ringing piano. Although The Beast Is G-Unit is lyrically on par with anything from the group's past, it still remains skimpy on intelligent, advanced art, making the biggest impact by being stunning, shocking and thrilling as opposed to the aesthetic of being fascinating and intriguing from an intellectual standpoint.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Last month I had the opportunity to hear BACK TO BLACK by Amy Winehouse courtesy of a co-worker of mine. Normally my musical preferences is at the opposite end of the spectrum (darker and more aggressive) but in Amy's case I loved what I heard. I finally got a hold of my own copy of BACK TO BLACK. I have been listening to the cd non-stop. I really don't care for r&b music. Today's r&b is slickly overproduced. Amy's music has a vintage Motown influence with a splash of jazz thrown in to the mix. The production is gritty like a lot of old school r&b\/soul music were back in the day. I like how unique Amy's vocals are. They have a slighty whiney, raspy edge but without being annoying. I think the standout track on the entire album is the hilarious \"Rehab\". Gotta love the lyrics. Another great track is \"You Know I'm No Good\". For some odd reason the song sounded like it would have been great for the great Shirley Bassey to sing. Not wild about the rap on the remixed version of the song. I wished the album wasn't so short but on the other hand it left me very eager to hear more from Amy.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"As much as I wish this were a full album, I realized over the course of this EP that it is certainly better to have four amazing songs than twelve mediocre ones. This is a wonderful return for Fleetwood Mac, four beautiful songs, played as only FM can.\n\nIt's really Lindsey's show, the songs feeling very much like his recent solo work, but with the air-tight Fleetwood\/McVie rhythm section and Stevie Nicks's harmonies complementing Lindsey's playing and singing with absolute perfection.\n\nI can imagine the arguments the band had (Lindsey probably wanted a full album; Stevie thinks it's all about singles now) before they compromised on releasing an EP. Well, whatever brings these four people together (or if ever by some miracle Christine rejoins the group, though I doubt we'll ever see that), it was worth it. You can't compare it to classics like Rumours or Tusk, but this is an outstanding set of songs from the 2013 version of this great band.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours, vocally, \"Sexual Healing\" is a prime example. For starters, that hypnotic \"Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up\" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track. Marvin's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom. I can picture hips gyrating, beautiful women dancing in the background, red satin sheets, candles, rose petals and the whole bit.\n\nIn all my years of listening to music, never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth. Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner (or partners) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song. The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly.","classification":5,"fold":9}

It is like they took a gigantic leap between their first tenous steps and then finally realized their potential and started making some of the best rock music ever.  The book-let is very nice and the lyrics are typed in an easy to read font. They look dreadfull though and those haircuts make them look like hobos. Apart from this is a work of true genius and they set a standard for rock muisicans that have been met by very few artists indeed, roling stones being one of them. This collection has some of their best tracks ever written and I could go on and on about it but if I had to pick a few then it is strawberry fields forever, across the universe and here comes the sun.

I'm trying alternative medicine to see if I can get rid of it.  It's hard to find an oncologist, who will monitor my condition while I try to alternative method for 3-6 months.

I think this is the thinking around Thompson using Wilco's The Loft Studio , taking himself out of his comfort zone & adding something unpredictable to the process.\nQuite polish, slick & sophisticated, being recorded in loft I thought it would be more rough n ready (I suppose he already done that with Dream Attic).\nThe usually mix of themes, being in good & bad relationships, curious characters & an homage to the guitarists that have influenced Thompson throughout his career (as always there is some great guitar playing on the album).\nThe songs on the deluxe version of the album are all good & worth paying the little bit extra (I find it amazing how Thompson can keep on banging out so many songs).\nSo yet another fascinating record (Thompson seems incapable of releasing a bad album) my an artist who still has a lot more to say.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully...They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's\"Nickel Romeo,\" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (\"Something That You Said\", \"I Will Take Care of You\", \"Grateful\"). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles work, period, on \"Ask Me No Questions\" and \"Here Right Now,\" and Vicki sounds great on \"Single by Choice,\" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock.\" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \"Mixed Messages\"? As for \"The Rain Song,\" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!\nThe ensemble vocals on \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Stealing Rosemary\" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch. My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened _Doll Revolution_ by dropping \"Lost at Sea,\" \"Song for a Good Son,\" and \"Between the Two.\"  I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to _Doll Revolution_. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","classification":5,"fold":9}

Here they are played with startling by Paul Zukofsky. Daniel Shafran, the famed Russian cellist provides the best performance of  the cello concerto I have hear (and I have heard many). The wondrous voices of Loraine Hunt and Arleen Auger, two women who left the earth much too early, are included. There are some surprises as well; the Brahms Schumann variations and the piano sonata and piano concerto of Clara Schumann.\nIt is hard to complain about anything here.

{"text":"I saw \"Sing Street\" in the theater this past weekend (more on that later). As is the case in a John Carney movie, \"Sing Street\" also oozes music from start to finish, and I couldn't wait to check out the soundtrack after having seen the movie. My search led me to this, which combines both the original songs (performed by the movie's fictional band Sing Street), as well as a bunch of the other classic 80s songs that we hear throughout the movie.\n\n\"Sing Street - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" (17 tracks; 57 min.) is an equal opportunity provider for both the original songs and the 80s classics. We get 8 of each (the soundtrack starts off with a very short snippet of the movie's dialogue). Let's take a closer look at those original songs, all written by John Carney and\/or Gary Clark, and performed by studio session players (including, yes, Glen Hansard, the star of \"Once\"). If you wonder what a \"Futurist Band\" might sound like, it sounds remarkably like Duran Duran-meets-Franz Ferdinand. Check out the first song (and one of the movie's key scenes) \"The Riddle of the Mode\", with its irresistible melody and instrumentation. It is clearly the best of the 8 original songs, and should be a hit on mainstream commercial radio (if that was any good, which of course it isn't). The other must-have original song is \"Drive It Like You Stole It\", with a clear Hall & Oates influence, and sounding oh so good. Of the others, I also like \"Girls\", short and sweet, as well as \"To Find You\", the only slow song of these 8 originals (and playing towards the end of the movie, not midway as it is sequenced here). As to the 80s classics, there isn't a single weak one here (save, perhaps. Motorhead's \"Stay Clean\"). Duran Duran's \"Rio\" plays prominently in the movie (including the song's video), as does Hall & Oates' \"Maneater\" and M's \"Pop Music\". Maroon 5's Adam Levine's new song \"Go Now\" (not a cover of the Moody Blues' song of the same name) plays in the movie's concluding scene and over the end titles. The other songs included here such as The Jam's outstanding \"Town Called Malice\" only plays a few seconds in the movie (even though it played prominently in the trailer). Inexcusably missing from this soundtrack is Flash & the Pan's \"Walking In the Rain\", which plays prominently in the movie. How is this not on here? The last 2 tracks on the digital release are bonus tracks of some sort: I don't recall hearing The Score's \"Up\" in the movie, and then there is an unnecessary repeat (and note-for-note) rendering of \"Drive It Like You Stole It\" by Hudson Thames (who?).\n\nAs to the movie itself, it is the spiritual prequel to \"Once\", and a delight from start to finish. I found myself with a smile on my face pretty much the entire movie, and love its sheer exuberance. Ah, to be young! If you liked Carney's \"Once\" and \"Begin Again\", you will love \"Sing Street\", I guarantee it. \"Sing Street\", both the soundtrack and the movie, is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.\n\nWhile her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.\n\nOverall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"I've never been much of a Dixie Chicks fan; I really can't say why, as I respect them as musicians, but just never got into their music.  But when I heard that Emily Robison (lately divorced from country singer\/songwriter Charlie Robison, a contributing factor here) and Marty Maguire were creating a non-Chicks album, I got interested.\n\nCourt Yard Hounds is an interesting band\/album.  They create breezy folk\/pop (think Sheryl Crow, but with better lyrics).  The sisters are easily at their best when they're not taking themselves too seriously; the raucous \"It Didn't Make a Sound,\" the angry \"Ain't No Son,\" the charming \"Delight\".  \"The Coast\" is an uncomplicated, lyrical, beautiful pop song--one of the best of the genre I've heard in a while.  \"See You In the Spring\" is a marvelous duet with Jakob Dylan (lately of the Wallflowers, and also of Bob Dylan).  Even the ending track, \"Fear of Wasted Time,\" is beautiful, and some of the more serious songs--\"Fairytale\" and \"Skyline,\" for example--strike the right notes.\n\nEmily Robison has a strong lead voice, and both sisters are accomplished musicians.  As I'm not familiar with the Chicks' music, I can't say how it really compares; but I can tell you that, if you like uncomplicated, well-written pop music, this is the album for you.  Whether this duo will manage to stick it out over multiple albums (the Chicks are already back on tour) remains to be seen; perhaps COURT YARD HOUNDS will go down as a one-time fling, but at least it'll be a memorable one.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I have always listed Gojira as one of my favorite metal bands, yet I've realized that I don't listen to them much. I like their music, but in some ways it is just too exhausting to listen to for any prolonged period. It's heavy, bludgeoning and usually kind of a downer lyric-wise. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. With Magma, Gojira has made the perfect album for me! For one, it is relatively short with only 8 \"real\" songs, several under the 4 minute mark. But mostly, this is \"easier listening\" Gojira - not to say it's not heavy - it definitely is, but there is more room to breathe, there are breaks from the action and for the most part, clean vocals. This album was self produced and recorded in their new studio in NYC and definitely still sounds like a Gojira album. I knew that the subject matter was about the Duplantier brothers losing their mother to cancer, but I generally don't listen too much to lyrics, so didn't think that would affect my impression of the album. Well, it's hard not to hear what's going on lyrically and my take on Magma, is that it is in many ways a concept album. You can hear the shift amongst fear, anger, sadness, resignation and ultimately, peace that the brothers experienced while dealing with their mother's illness. \"Low Lands\" is the most obvious of the bunch - near the end of the album, it is a sweeping, haunting, majestic masterpiece that carries a ton of emotional heft. Joe is asking his mother to describe the afterlife, \"Tell me what you see, when you are everywhere\", and you can imagine a spirit flying across the earth, seeing everything at once. It is heartbreaking, yet also comforting and at least for me, hopeful. The title Magma perfectly describes the energy of the album - not a huge explosion, but more of a hot, propulsive force that oozes and bubbles out of the speakers. There are machine gun riffs on \"Pray\" that sound very Meshuggah-like, and some squeals used in the verses of \"Only Pain\" and \"Stranded\" that pay homage to Dimebag (maybe?). The title track has some really cool pinch harmonics in the verse that give it an otherworldly sound - Joe mentioned to Guitar World that he may have a hard time pulling this one off live - we'll see! The overall sound is more straightforward than other Gojira albums - not a lot of wacky time changes or over the top guitar antics. The focus is on the songs - the writing is more mature and streamlined than on previous work, and it seems as though the brothers Duplantier are not interested in showing off their chops, they want to simply make good music. Mario Duplantier is arguably one of the sickest metal drummers on the planet - the guy is ridiculous. On Magma, he plays to the song - not a lot of flashy fills or crazy polyrhythms for the sake of letting people know he can play. Listen closely though, there is a lot of subtle stuff going on that is pure genius - things that may seem deceptively simple, but probably only Mario could ever have come up with. His drumming on \"Pray\" is absolutely hypnotic, just awesome. It is often more impressive to me when a guy with chops can restrain themselves and focus on enhancing the song - there's nothing worse than overplaying when it is inappropriate. Mario nails it here - can't say enough about him. In summary, this will certainly divide Gojira fans - some will complain it's not heavy enough and too mainstream and not death metal enough and the vocals aren't growly etc. Those things are all true, but the bottom line is that this is Gojira, they are good, they make good music and write good songs, so if you can appreciate their efforts and take the time to let this one sink in after 4 or 5 listens, you may come around to acknowledging that no matter how \"heavy\" this is, it is still worth listening to.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The endless \"news\" coverage of Amy Winehouse's personal problems somehow made me interested in checking out her music. When B-list pseudo-journalists prop themselves up by making fun of Amy's struggles, they occasionally throw in an actual snippet of the music, revealing that Amy deserves credit as a truly excellent singer. Sure she sounds a lot like classic soul divas such as Billie Holiday or Etta James. But she's much more than a mere imitator, showing the raw talent that adds attitude and understanding to her inherent technical abilities. That attitude and understanding can be heard in this album's biggest winners, like \"You Know I'm No Good,\" \"Back to Black,\" and the great Ashford & Simpson update \"Tears Dry on Their Own.\"\n\nBut while Amy is not the imitator some claim her to be, the musical backdrop of this album is definitely derivative, rarely straying from basic 60s Motown sounds (though at least the music here isn't the limp semi-R&B that's all most pop producers can come up with these days). This album is also quite undeveloped, with only half an hour of original material, propped up unsuccessfully with a horrendous second version of \"You Know I'm No Good\" that calls itself a \"remix\" but only turns up the bass and adds an unwelcome rap from the annoying Ghostface Killah (we can probably blame the record company for the anemic track listing). Regardless, Amy's talents as a singer and lyricist shine through, but unfortunately she appears to be gifted with that type of genius that comes with a streak of self-destruction. She might have a true masterpiece in her future - if she can pull herself together. [~doomsdayer520~]","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The product info; Elysium Limited Edition comes in a sturdy box which includes lyric & credit booklet, two cd's one of the entire album and the second with the instrumentals of the entire album housed in cardboard sleeves.\n\nThe content: Elysium opens with \"Leaving\" which sets the overall atmosphere for the rest of the album. The songs and arrangements are soothing as they are sharp and incisive in lyrical content in tracks such as \"Your Early Stuff\" ,\"Ego Music\", or breathtakingly heartbreaking on tracks such as \"Invisible\" and \"Breathing Space\". There is also upbeat tracks like \"Face Like That\" which is vintage PSB and should please that faction of the PSB fan base. However PSB steer clear from the vintage disco electronica and gets back on track with Elysium's pastoral and down-tempo musical arrangements and themes. This album finds the PSB very introspective and meditative on subjects as aging, relevancy, pop celebrity culture,personal shortcomings and death. In other words this is a release meant more for the head than the feet. Although not as intricate and varied as \"Behavior\" \"Elysium\" has the same melancholic execution in theme and sound.  The second CD of instrumentals provide \"Elysium\" another dimension of beauty and provides musical gravitas. I disagree with people reviewing this album as \"phoned in\" by PSB. This is a deliberately themed and musically arranged album to invoke another response from the listener and that response is to listen sit back and enjoy an album that is a perfect soundtrack for the change of season into Fall metaphorically and literally speaking. There have been rumors this may be the last PSB album and those rumors have been exacerbated by the the track \"Requiem in Denim and Leopard Skin\". I for one perish the thought! So for all complaining enjoy PSB while they are still around.","classification":5,"fold":9}

I love all their music though, and even enjoy the early seventies more hard rock priest. I already had the first remaster of this one , but this was worth the upgrade, it has four more songs and a whole dvd of the u.s. festival show from 1982. Priest did everyting right here, they should have never tried to do speed metal , which is a inferior brand of metal. (see painkiller) but even that was superior to most bands in  that genre. This one though is filled with classic tracks from the band: 'screaming for vengeance', 'electric eye', and many others. This one had not a weak song on it and it is one of the finest examples of harder melodic metal ever made. GEt the newest version. Frankly if record companies had brains they would have released lots of packages like this back in the 80's. Why wait 30 years? ten years was long enough , and now many of the people who first bought this are middle aged. Young people though should be happy to grab this one.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"In their seventies heyday, Earth Wind and Fire were one of the hottest touring acts in the world and an unstoppable singles machine. Band leader Maurice White and main singer Phillip Bailey had a chemistry that was almost unbeatable, and top notch musicians brought the chops. White eventually hit a supple groove that was both funky and popular, and when the hits started coming, like \"Shining Star\" and \"September,\" they helped make disco into a bit less of a dirty word.\n\nThey had another secret weapon in the EWF Horns. Punchy when they needed to be, smooth jazz when required, they often provided an 'x' factor in the band's best work. The band mixed these elements into a dynamite stage show that rivaled George Clinton's Mothership era for sheer audacity and showmanship. While there are no live tracks here, if you've ever seen the camp classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band\/dp\/B00009APB6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<\/a>, you'll see a tiny fraction of the excitement when the band performs \"Got To Get You Into My Life.\"\n\nListening to this CD several years after what EWF tunes had been trimmed from my library is a real trip down memory lane. From the opening Black Pride Themed \"Shining Star\" to the road-trip classic \"Getaway,\" these are all memorable hook-fests that livened up many an AM radio in the 70's. White often had a Utopian vision that he emphasized in his lyrics making these tunes both danceable and uplifting. Bailey's distinguished falsetto livened the ballads (like \"After The Love Has Gone\"), but EWF's real genius was making songs that were irresistible funky grooves. If you don't find yourself bopping to \"Boogie Wonderland,\" check and make sure your feet are still attached.\n\nOnly frustration - missing \"Love's Holiday,\" \"Magnetic,\" \"System of Survival\" or anything post 1983. Could have been a double disc, easily. But really, even without them, this single disc EWF CD is indispensable if you're an oldies buff.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"On this album Pat Travers is doing covers of blues compositions from the 1920s and 1930s. Some of these songs are standards in the blues genre, others are less well known.\n\nTravers does some interesting covers of some of these classic blues numbers but on many of them he misses the nuances and subtleties in the originals. Instead Travers treats many of these classic songs as straight out rockers. Pat Travers is good at straight up rockers; he's been doing that style of music successfully and well for decades. I like Pat Travers doing straight out rockers but, to my way of thinking, these old blues classics need a more subtle treatment than that.\n\nAs an example, the song \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out\" was covered by Eric Clapton back in the 1970s and by Peter Green on his 2001 release, Blues Don't Change. Both Clapton and Green understand the nuances of this music. Listen to Eric Clapton's version, listen to Peter Green's version, and then listen to Pat Travers doing this song as a rocker; you'll immediately hear the difference between Clapton and Green versus Travers.\n\nThese classic blues tracks are great material and deserve the attention of modern listeners and the ongoing interpretation\/re-interpretation of modern musicians. Pat Travers does some interesting things with these great old songs but I don't think he truly understands the blues in the way that people like Eric Clapton, Peter Green and others of their calibre do.\n\nOverall, a decent album. If you like Pat Travers, you'll like this album. But having heard covers of many of these blues classics done by musicians with a deeper understanding of the original material, I give this album 3 1\/2 to 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This is one of those albums that I really wanted to like, or least wanted to like more than I did. Not sure what the problem was for me. This \"type\" of music is normally the sort of stuff that I love. It's a very soulful blend of music (pop, rock, R&B, whatever you want to label it) with some definite retro roots in the old Stax and Hi Records sound. Great organ playing too. And yet, two dozen plays later, it never left a strong impression on me.\n\nHonestly, it really bothers me that I didn't get into this album that much. I had such high expectations after reading so many glowing reviews and positive articles about the band and I'm truly disappointed. The vocals of the lead singer aren't bad, but neither are they particularly distinct or memorable. While I admire the group's obvious love of old soul music, the overall sound is a bit derivative and nothing special. And that sums up most of the songs too. Clearly, this band has their hearts --- and soul --- in all the right places, but it feels, and sounds, like something crucial is missing.","classification":3,"fold":9}

I loved Israelites immediately, especially the guitar scale that ends the chorus (e.g., 0:32), it seemed comically out of place to me, it went in this direction that wasn't completely unexpected but seemed unusual, it felt awkward in a playful way. Plus there's this weird low voice moaning right before that so I'm already about to laugh. Anyhow, totally cool guitar riff.

Only with Chris Brown and others just feel flat, and her collaboration with Beyonce' Knowles on Feeling Myself, absolutely is a flop for both of them. I feel that Ms. Knowles absolutely didn't even come close to delivering her strongest A-game, considering of her collaborations with her husband Jay-Z like Drunk In Love delivered to her fans, but overall didn't ignite at strength. Nicki really didn't show it. Like the other songs on her album such as Pills N' Potions, it sincerely is a absolute waste of time. Perhaps, she need to find better in her own rapping, and Beyonce' should take notice for her next collaborations with her husband. Hopefully, they can deliver better than this song did.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Like Rush, R.E.M., The Cure and Radiohead before them, Arcade Fire seem bent on making unintelligible college-rock music that while often times musically engaging, is lyrically obtuse. One criteria that I use in determining whether an album is classic or merely just good. \"The Suburbs\" continues Arcade Fire's reach for artistic merits, but the album falls short--somewhere between good and very good, but not great or classic.\n\nWhen I see 16 tracks on an album I get nervous. Very few artists can pull off a lengthy 16 track opus, but Arcade Fire do a reasonably good job of it. The album is not boring overall, but there are a few tracks that could have been left on the cutting room floor, or as b-sides. The quality of the musical arrangements, melodies and compositions fit together well as a whole entity, but not individually. There are no really memorable tracks here, they all kind of compliment one another.\n\nThe standout tracks to me were \"Modern Man\", \"City With No Children\", \"Half Light II\", \"Suburban War\", \"We Used To Wait\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains\". The rest of the tracks were serviceable. I have been listening to pop\/rock music for so many years now that I could not help but notice a few riffs borrowed from other pop\/rock songs. For example, \"City With No Children\" has a guitar riff that comes dangerously close to The Rolling Stones' \"Street Fighting Man\" just change up slightly. \"Sprawl II\" has a synthesizer riff that's very similar to Julian Lennon's \"Stick Around\".\n\nBut it's the lyrics that I really come back to. Arcade Fire has, from the very beginning, been an intangible entity. Like R.E.M., you have to revert to the lyric book just to figure out what they're singing about, but even then you are left with a rather oblique picture. It wasn't until later in their career, that R.E.M. started writing songs that were more accessible, and their popularity grew exponentially. For their first four albums, they were relatively obscure and mainly college rock. Fellow countrymen, Rush, had their first seven albums filled with fantasy\/sci-fi themes that really didn't connect to a larger audience, and it wasn't until their eighth album that they really hit their stride combining lyrics and music as a whole. I feel that same issue plagues Arcade Fire. \"The Suburbs\" is not accessible. No matter how many times I reviewed the lyric sheet, I found my mind wandering off and listening to the melodies and arrangements instead.\n\nMusically, the band has changed slightly from album to album, but they are still recognizable as Arcade Fire. I guess what I am getting at here is that the band has room to grow. They are not a winner right out of the gate like some bands, nor are they one dimensional like some other bands. They sit poised to be as great as R.E.M. or Rush or even Radiohead, but they are not quite there yet. They seem to feeling their way still, but I believe they are capable of great things musically--it's there, when you listen to what they are doing, they just need a producer to harness and capture their essence.\n\nHere's how \"The Suburbs\" compares to Arcade Fire's other works:\n\n2004 Funeral: Four Stars\n2007 Neon Bible: Three and a Half Stars\n2010 The Suburbs: Three and a Half Stars","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"I'm pleased to say that this is a good album. I have been very fortunate to have had access to an advance copy and I've listened to this a lot over the last few days; it's varied, unexpected in places and contains some very good tracks.\n\nPaul Simon has always been a very fine musician who has developed and experimented throughout his career. He once, for example, set himself the challenge of using every note of the chromatic scale in a single song: the result was Still Crazy After All These Years, which is a magnificently beautiful song and a true classic. Not all his challenges have been met so successfully and I'm not sure that there's anything of quite that stature here, but this is a fine album nonetheless.\n\nSimon incorporates all sorts of styles including rap, jazz and many others. Several tracks are very rhythm-driven (like Wristband and The Werewolf), but beautiful melodies are still in evidence in the title track and Proof Of Love, which I think is a truly lovely song. The album is very varied in instrumentation, feel and style and I'm delighted to see Simon still stretching the boundaries in his seventies  but this is still recognisable a Paul Simon album and collection of really good songs. His voice is still in good shape and he's a real master at putting a song across.\n\nSimon's lyrics have always been outstandingly good, and they are as sharp as ever here. There is a good deal of rage against social injustice as well as profound expressions of personal emotion. Take this, from the Werewolf, for example:\n\n\"The fact is most obits are mixed reviews\nLife is a lottery, a lot of people lose\nAnd the winners, the grinners with money-coloured eyes\nEat all the nuggets, then they order extra fries\n\nIgnorance and arrogance, a national debate\nPut the fight in Vegas, that's a billion dollar gate\nRevenues, pay per views, it should be pretty healthy\nThe usual deductions, and it all goes to the wealthy\"\n\nStrong stuff  and it's good to see that real social bite still remains in at least one veteran songwriter.\n\nI've loved Paul Simon's music since Kathy's Song was among the first songs I learned to play and sing, almost half a century ago. He hasn't always hit the spot with every album, but this is a really good one and I like it a lot. I don't know whether everyone will agree  I have always thought Hearts and Bones was quite brilliant, but it wasn't one of Simon's biggest hit albums, for example  but I think there's real quality here, and I would recommend it warmly.\n\n[By the way, the Deluxe Version contains \"bonus material\" which is actually well worth having, including a fine live rendition of Duncan and the excellent title track from Dion's (also good) recent album New York Is My Home, which Dion and Simon sang together. It's not always worth getting the Deluxe Version of albums, but I'd recommend this one.]","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"In his fifteen year career as a solo performer, Eric Benet has stayed in his lane for most of his career. He has done the retro soul thing with few contemporary updates within that window in time. He has amassed a somewhat impressive body of work, even if his personal life has gotten him more noteriety than his music (See: His marriage to Halle Berry, for example). He has done six studio albums- five released and one shelved- including his recently released \"Lost In Time\". On this new album, he forgoes his longtime producer Demonte Posey in favor of George Nash, Jr.- who, along with Posey, produced Eric's 1996 debut \"True To Myself\". This time around, Eric goes into the territory of live instrumentation as well as live recording- to give it an 'old school' feel. Joining him on this recording are Ledisi, Chrisette Michele, Eddie Levert of The O'Jays and Faith Evans, who makes her second appearance on an Eric Benet album, having previously appeared on his 1999 sophomore album \"A Day In The Life\".\n\nThere are some good songs on this album, but upon listening closely, one can instantly notice how a great deal of the songs sound noticeably similar to classic soul songs of yesteryear. The song \"Feel Good\" sounds a lot like Cheryl Lynn's \"Got To Be Real\". The ballad \"Always A Reason\" is basically The Stylistics' \"Break Up To Make Up\" with more chord progressions. The recession themed \"Paid\" is The O'Jays' \"Backstabbers\" played in a different key. On the title track \"Lost In Time\", he channels Blue Magic's \"Sideshow\". The musical arrangement to \"Good Life\" sounds eeriely similar to Sister Sledge's \"We Are Family\". While Eric means well in his effort to bring back traditional soul, he ends up looking like a copycat in the process. With that said, this album could have been a lot better if he used retro soul music as an inspiration and not straight out plagiarism.","classification":3,"fold":9}

There is a bit of hip-hip mixed with R&B here but once you get past the good tracks and to the second half of the album it's full of excellent songs that are mid-tempos and beautiful ballads. Some of the highlights of the slower songs are \"That's What Love Is\" (my favorite song), \"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\",  \"Talk To Me\", \"If You Love Me\" (which sounds like it could have fit right in on her previous huge hit of a CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>) and even \"Come To Me (Peace)\" which ends the album on a slightly more upbeat and inspiring note. I think out of all of Mary's albums this is one of the most misunderstood. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Life\/dp\/B0000AQS8W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;some people just weren't digging this one. Honestly, L&L is one of my favorites by Mary. It was very downbeat for the most part and I think that's what people didn't like. Same thing happened here. More than half the album is slower and full of meaning and songs about relationship\/self-esteem up's and down's. The production on a few of the tracks is a little more Pop\/R&B than a lot of her earlier material too.\n\nSo even with certain differences I must admit that after listening again (just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Life\/dp\/B0000AQS8W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;album) I find that this is a great (and once again) underrated effort by Mary J. Blige. To me it's more even than her next outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stronger-with-Each-Tear\/dp\/B002UZ5G7U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stronger with Each Tear<\/a>&nbsp;(although that album was solid and upbeat) and is pretty much as great as her previous effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>&nbsp;believe it or not. It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads\/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts. I'm now not ashamed to say that. Beautiful effort.\n\n4.4 stars.\n\nDOWNLOAD:\n\"What Love Is\"\n\"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\"\n\"Stay Down\" &\n\"If You Love Me\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"At one point, Jordan Knight was a teen \"heartthrob\" in the 80's boy band New Kids on the Block. Face it, \"Hangin' Tough\" was blaring everywhere.  Now in 2011, Knight finds his career past it's critical and commercial peak.  That said, Knight contributes a solid, if `copy-cat' effort on 2011's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Unfinished\/dp\/B004TB6GGI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Unfinished<\/a>, which finds Knight putting his hand in a `grab-bag' of modern pop\/R&B tricks.  To his credit, most of the `tricks' work in his favor as his superb tenor and falsetto are both still intact.  Unfinished never pushes the envelope to be considered revolutionary, but how many people do push the envelope in 2011? That's rhetorical by the way.\n\n\"Let's Go Higher\" dabbles in electro-infused R&B production and auto-tune; typical.  That said, \"Let's Go Higher\" is a fine opening cut and superb choice for a promo single for this effort.  The songwriting is typical for modern R&B, including a co-write by electro-R&B star Colby O.  This cut does work for Knight, but would have been just as much (if not more so) suitable for Colby O, Jay Sean, Taio Cruz or Jeremih.  \"Unfinished,\" the title cut, demonstrates a fine vocal performance by Knight.  The chorus is catchy enough, but not the most memorable anyone has every heard.  \"Like A Wave,\" produced by famed songwriter\/producer Jonas Jeberg works reasonably well, without ruffling `many feathers.'  The bridge section is the highlight.\n\n\"One More Night,\" a Clinton Sparks\/DJ Snake contribution, again relies on auto-tune for `freshness.' The electro-pop groove is a strong point here, not to mention the nice use of synths.\n\"Stingy\" is as solid (or average) as anything else, however the spoken word part is a bit odd, though distinct to this cut.  \"Kiss It Away\" is a personal favorite moment of the album, perhaps lending the album it's most authentic moment since, well \"Kiss It Away.\"  Produced by Ryan Tedder (One Republic, produced \"Halo,\" \"Already Gone\"), this cut is the type of cut one would envision Knight would revolve to in 2011 as opposed to some of the more electro-centric cuts.  The songwriting is great, particularly the chorus: \"Cause everyday you're tearing me apart,  so everything I gave you from my heart (kiss it away), you might as well just (kiss it away) so turn the lights and put your lips like this, and close your eyes, it's time to kiss our love goodbye...\" Knight sounds exceptional without ever sounding schmaltzy or unbelievable.\n\n\"Inside\" keeps Ryan Tedder aboard, though it is a shade less enjoyable than \"Kiss It Away.\"  The production is smart, with a nice easy-going vibe given off from this cut.  \"O-Face\" is catchy enough, if somewhat risqu&eacute; - well as risqu&eacute; as a forty-something pop star can be.  \"Rockstar\" is a `B' cut at best while \"Up N Down\" exploits how gimmickry has taken over pop\/R&B in the 00's and 10's.  \"Believe\" closes the effort strongly, with excellent vocals by Knight.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Unfinished\/dp\/B004TB6GGI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Unfinished<\/a>&nbsp;won't be remembered as an `epic' effort, but it does keep Knight relevant.  Nothing strikes home as much as the Tedder assisted ballad \"Kiss It Away,\" but sadly most people will only be aware of this great cut if they purchase Unfinished.  3 stars.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"On this cover of  All of the Stars, Jackie Evancho's voice is drop dead gorgeous, even though she employs a much less classical voice than usual. To me, she has given this song a far more approachable treatment. She starts out in a pensive voice in her lower register, then she works her way up. She also sings her own harmony track, which is a clever addition to her styling.\n\nPeople who view the video of this song might feel Jackie has re-purposed this song into an anthem for a topic that has been getting some recent play, but until now, nowhere nearly as sensitively as her voice does. She has done this sort of thing in the past. She sang My Heart Will Go on from Titanic on the 2014 PBS Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington D. C.  In the process, her treatment of that song transformed it from one woman's private love and loss into an anthem of tragedy, heartbreak and healing for an entire country. Nobody can do this as well as she can, and she does it yet again with All of the Stars.\n\nI am very impressed with what she has accomplished in her short life. This adds to that.

{"text":"After loving most of the tracks from the last Warrant album, \"Born Again (2006)\" I was stunned that on that album the band had (and thankfully) gone back to playing hard rock music then that dumb idea they had to go in a grunge direction... the new warrant sound amazed me that it sounded so great, a bit of AC\/DC rawness and a few newer sounds to make it great for both new and old rockers. However, on this album, there seems to be little of that new spark they had on the previous album, it seems to have gone much softer, yet somehow 80's metal. So, with that said, keep in mind, I did like the last album, and I am not one of those fans who say this band is not the same without Jani Lane, because Jaime St. James may not have had the vocal range of Jani, but for that album, I think he did a fantastic job... but with that said, St. James has parted ways with the band and Robert Mason has stepped up to the mic to try and fill some rather big shoes.\nBut quite frankly, I was not very impressed with his vocals, nor the lyrics to this entire album.\n\nIt seems that the same song has been recorded 3 or 4 times on this album, mostly they where a balled, but it just seemed, like the rock music of this album is very generic. I'm not saying the music is bad, I'm just saying that everything seemed to sound like something you had either heard before, or it just sounded like standard way of recording something you can stand from start to finish, while not being memorable. I found nothing here that stands out above everything else.\n\nWhen I first heard \"Born Again\" there where riffs and lyrics I liked from the very first moment I heard it, but on this album, I think I heard one thing that sounded a little creative, and all that was, was two guitars playing scales together, but the band seemed to be jamming away rather nicely, but even now when I try to remember what track that was, and after a few listens, it's just not standing out as something more then \"it's the best track on this album\" (which isn't much) rather then \"that's an incredible unforgettable song\" if you know what I mean?\n\nIt sounded to me a lot of the time like Aerosmith fillers... it sounds like Aerosmith, but just not a hit song or a fan favorite sort of thing, if you follow what I am saying about this album... it surely isn't a bad album, but then again, it's far from ever going to be great, nor get any attention. I can't see any of these songs being played on the radio in future as some sort of \"classic\" that anyone will remember anything from this album, and I certainly did not hear anything here that someone could convince me would be welcomed into the listings of Warrants greatest hits. By the looks of things, it looks like the band is pushing for \"Life's a Song\" to become a hit single, but I really don't think it's good enough, especially when Warrant have created just such a thing in the past.\n\nI was really disappointed that \"Born Again\" didn't do much better for this band then it did, but this album here, I can fully understand why it will not chart, be memorable to really anyone but die-hard warrant fans, and I definitely can't see this album generating new fans or welcoming back forgotten fans to take an interest in this band again.\n\nThe overall sound of this album doesn't sound like it's something new, it sounds rather 80's metal... which I am not saying is a bad thing, I do love 80's metal, however I just could not help but compare them to Warrants 80's metal hits, and they just don't feel like they should be standing side by side against any of them. There was only a couple of times I heard that hint of the sound the band had on the last album, but for the most part, the songs here felt very empty, and no attitude or emotion was felt, neither love or hate. There was no great musical direction, great lyric writing, a melody that stood out, there just was not really much at all in the way of anything being memorable. There might have been 2 songs on here I thought where OK, but like I said, far from their best efforts, and very far from anything to be considered part of the greatest hits.\n\nI'm sorry to say this, especially since Warrant is one of my all time favorite bands, but this album has been a disappointing 5 year wait. I'm not sure if I would go as far and say this band need a new singer, because I am not too sure who wrote what in the lyrics department for this one, but if it was Robert Mason handling most of the lyric writing for this album, then the rest of the band should really try seeking other more creative writers to help with the lyric writing side of Warrant, because the ones here just seemed to keep repeating themselves, there was nothing at all special about them, and the phrase \"I love you\" was used way too many times overall. I kept rolling my eyes when hearing it, and thinking, \"Why bother to try and compete with 'Heaven'\"? If you have a masterpeice, why try to paint it again, especially trying to paint it this time with no colors?\n\nWell thats what I thought about this album, but I still have my hopes up that Warrant will bounce back soon with a great tune, great riffs, and great lyrics once again.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Like all Bach Guild 'Big Box' collections, this is a terrific value - in this case, 13 hours and 32 minutes (according to my iTunes tracklist) and 130 tracks of music, most of Shubert's most well-known symphonies (unfortunately lacking his Symphony No. 4 in C minor, D. 417 \"Tragic\", plus a good selection of his other works - songs, dances, sonatas, chamber music. Schubert wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Schubert for the first time.\n\nThe point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.\n\nI value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.\n\nThen, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.\n\nRegardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to. I've had this particular Bach Guild set since purchasing it in 2013, in fact, and it's about time I posted a review here to express my opinion on the worthiness of this set!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Rick Ross doesn't care. He doesn't care who likes him. He doesn't care who hates his fast cars and fast women rap lifestyle. He's just going to keep making music that he loves. And if you don't like it, oh well. That's confident, cocky & arrogant all at the same time. But that's Rick Ross. And he has a right to be. No matter how much people clown him, he bounces back (the \"Officer Ricky\" scandal, the beef with 50, the lawsuit with the real Rick Ross) All of that has fed him and now he has dropped his best album so far, \"Teflon Don\".\n\n\"Teflon Don\" is a good title for this album because just like John Gotti, nothing sticks to him. He keeps making street bangers and radio hits. Each of his albums has a hit song that gets heavy rotation in the clubs or radio. His first single \"Super High\", ft Ne-Yo is another radio hit (Similar to \"Magnificent\" from \"Deeper Than Rap\") Aston Martin Music\", could possibly be another radio hit (I don't know why Drake is on here. He just sings a little on the chorus) As with every Rick Ross album there are a slew of guest appearances starting with Jay-Z on the solid track \"Free Mason\". Gucci Mane has no purpose on \"MC Hammer\". Neither does Styles P on \"B.M.F (Blowin' Money Fast)\". Both these songs are bangers but they sound so similar. They should not have been put back-to-back on the album. I don't know what he was aiming for on \"Live Fast, Die Young\", ft Kanye West.  The same for \"No. 1\" with Diddy & Trey Songz. The epic \"Maybach Music III\", has the feel of a good movie. It has a sharp 16 from T.I. and a beautifully sung chorus by Erykah Badu.  Jadakiss verse almost ruins the song but then there's a build-up that sets up Rick Ross that's perfect. This might be the best production I ever heard from J.U.S.T.I.C.E League.\n\nRick Ross must be reading my reviews. After my criticism of \"Deeper Than Rap\", he has improved in all the areas I burned him on. He has made an album that could have been classic. I think if he would have combined the top 5 songs of \"Deeper Than Rap\" and the top 6 songs of this album, he would have had a great album. His voice over a banging J.U.S.T.C.E. League track is dynamic. He still has that Mafioso bravado. That \"Mayweather money, looking funny in the light\" rap style.  But this time we learn a little more about William Roberts. And no matter what you say to bring him down. No matter how many beefs he encounters. One thing is for sure, Rick Ross is living fast, spending money & loving his life.

Stone, despite commercial shortcomings (and being in her 30s when her first solo album materialized in 1999's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Black-Diamond\/dp\/B00001O2UV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Diamond<\/a>) managed two gold albums (Black Diamond and 2001's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mahogany-Soul\/dp\/B00005PJFV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mahogany Soul<\/a>), as well as some notable hits in R&B circles (\"No More Rain In This Cloud,\" \"Brotha,\" \"U-Haul,\" and \"Baby\" amongst them). 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rich-Girl\/dp\/B008D1RD5S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rich Girl<\/a>&nbsp;plays very much like your typical Angie Stone album, only there is a bit of a downgrade with the 'swagger.' While Stone has always had anachronistic tendencies, she usually pulls off this 'old with the new' extremely confidently off-setting the 'vintage' nature.  This independent release comes off too safe, too conservative, and lacks the 'excitability' and 'vivaciousness' that other Stone albums present.\n\nOverall the material is solid, though even the best cuts are safe. \"Do What U Gotta Do\" proceeds after a pointless intro, and is more notable in the context of this album than it was as somewhat of a bland, safe single.  It is not 'the second coming' by any means, but it stands out amongst such a safe set. Similarly, single \"Backup Plan\" showcases Stone's rich alto, but never 'captivates' the way the Gladys Knight sampling \"No More Rain In This Cloud\" or even Marvin Gaye cover \"Trouble Man\" did on her debut.  A gospel drawn out cut entitled \"Guilty\" is lovely, though a bit on the long side and by no means 'hip.'\n\n\"Rich Girl,\" the title track, is the album's best track.  Well produced, intact with Stone's signature supporting vocals, \"Rich Girl\" lacks flashiness, but suits Stone the best of any cut on the effort. \"Right in Front of Me\" is safe, but lays well with a vintage soul groove.  \"U Lit My Fire\" falls a bit short on the verses (Stone could assert more and bust a sweat perhaps), but delivers on a catchy chorus (\"The first time that I met you baby... you lit my fire\/you lit my fire...\").  \"Sisters\" closes somewhat 'schmalzy,' but the slow-paced anthemic cuts thematic material ('we are always sisters,' etc.) should strike some relatable chords with the audience.\nThe other tracks are solid with none bombing, but they don't stand out in particular. Even those that do save for maybe \"Rich Girl\" would have trouble superseding Stone's greatest hits.\n\nOverall, if you are a hardcore Stone fan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rich-Girl\/dp\/B008D1RD5S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rich Girl<\/a>&nbsp;will appeal to you because Stone's voice sounds as polished as ever.  If you prefer 'old-school' R&B in the soul, retro-soul, neo-soul, or adult contemporary R&B vein, this album will suit you. If you are a more casual fan however, you may find this album safe, humdrum, and a bit underwhelming. From a critical standpoint, the judgement is this is a solid and soulful album, though not exciting. Furthermore, it does not deliver Stone's best material, even when her vocals soar.  3 Stars.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Being a \"faithful and devoted\" Depeche Mode fan, I feel obliged to buy their releases, no matter how important or unnecessary. Music has become so bland, and CD singles so scarce these days, it is almost impossible to find interesting releases that are worth spending $6 for. Well, here is one, though I would rather have all 10+ mixes of \"Revolution\" in one disc, instead of having to wait until April 28 for the 2LP 12\" vinyl for the next instalment. Cannot but feel a little cheated, but noone is forcing me to purchase anything I do not want. This brand new CD single is a nice little DM addition to my collection, and I am happy to have purchased it. Truth be told, the song is nothing to get crazy about, though it is interesting to hear their ambiguous spiritual\/political message, trying to get both sides talking. I find even more enjoyable the video with the brilliant Lenin references. Nonetheless, this is a tasty appetiser for the upcoming \"Spirit\" album.\n\nCD single tracklist:\n\n1.

{"text":"The song itself is a bit \"drive on the coatails\" of \"We Found Love\". A definite club song, well engineered for FM, it's classic Rihanna in this stage of her career stating with Only Girl In The World. If nobody has noticed, radio is now more driven by the beats and Dance Hall\/House\/ Trance influences now, vs the heavy Hip Hop\/Rap that was a few years early. The european influence has finally moved into our top 40 frame of mind with a vengence. (take her work with David Guetta, Jump Smokers, etc).This is moving fast on the dance charts.\n\nThis will not be the blockbuster of lets say \"We Found Love\", but is a good 10 5 single. As many have stated, she may no be getting a bit overexposed, but it does not diminish her talents of the strength of her music. This is a good single, well worth listening to, and will be on many a DJ's list, But for the future, it's time to seek out other styles as well, maybe a few back to her Barbados routes, or more unique duets, (no more Chris Browns please). Also we have not really scenne a definitive ballad from her yet,.\n\nThis young lady is sooo talented...her management needs to look at her next 5 years more rather then the quick cash in. Her talent is just to damn good.\n\nUPDATES..now the single is of the \"past\" and the predictions were correct. While very popular. it did not achieve #1 (Billboard charts), and was a club favorite, especially the remixes. Her next album and singles as I hoped changed styles, the first a bit more mainstream ( Diamonds) , then R&B and raw (Rude Boy type)(Pour it Up), and now a top 5 excellent ballad, As usual with reviews of superstars, it you dare to not say \" excellent\" or \"love her\" you get negatives.  I do have all her releases, Club mixes included, and will continue to buy them. She is the type of artist that you can buy unheard, she is that good.","classification":4,"fold":9}

He sounds too much like any one of the cookie-cutter singers that fill the so-called \"hip-hop\/R & B\" charts today.  He's trying too hard to appeal to a younger audience, and in the process, he may be alienating his fan base.\n\nThe songs on \"Ridin' Solo\" just don't work because of their over-attention to an electronically-altered Sweat, too similar to the \"tricks\" used by the much younger Jamie Fox or T-pain.\n\nFormer GAP Band front man and solo artist Charlie Wilson is appealing to the young crown while maintaining his legion of older fans because he has not quite \"sold out\" his integrity and voice, balancing the two camps that are fans of his sound\/style.\n\nKeith, you need to give Uncle C a call.","classification":2,"fold":9}

Though \"Believe\" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does \"Living Proof\".\nThe songs are good dance songs my favorite is \"A Different Kind of Love Song\" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before \"Song for the Lonely\".\nHowever all the songs sound like the same vain of \"Believe\", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over.\nI don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, \"Living Proof\" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs.\nThe other strong cuts include \"Rain, Rain\" and \"Love One Another\" which sounds a lot like \"A Different Kind of Love Song\" which is a faster version of \"Song for the Lonely\" which is a slower version of \"Believe\"....Get the picture?\nThere is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however \"Living Proof\" is just the same old \"Beliefs\".\nCher does dance good, however if you want a really good dance album get Kylie Minoques \"Fever\" which is sizzling hot.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"New life has been breathed into the art of contemporary instrumental guitar with the first solo album of original material from veteran guitarist and composer Shambhu, aka Neil Vineberg. (Shambhu has a long list of impressive credits, having performed with Narada Michael Walden, Carlos Santana, and Clarence Clemons and recorded with Whitney Houston.)\n\nSacred Love is one of the most beautiful and most impressive guitar albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. One of the photographs on the CD, of Shambhu smiling meekly with his hand over his heart, might lead listeners to think that they are about to hear a collection of ponderous instrumental musings typically associated with New Age music. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But this is not that album. (Incidentally, the photograph is appropriate in that it conveys the sense of the music coming from Shambhu's heart and making its way into those of listeners, which it does).\n\nThe CD is brimming with masterfully played, boundary-crossing tunes touching everything from New Age and fusion to world music and smooth jazz. In fact, several cuts are radio-friendly and would be right at home on commercial jazz stations.\n\nShambhu wrote most of the compositions, co-wrote two or three, and plays acoustic and electric guitars. He also plays electric sitar, which reinforces the exotic Indian sounds of several tracks. This Southeast Asian influence is also reflected in the guitarist's name, a Sanskrit word meaning \"source of happiness,\" which is an apt description of his music as well. Shambhu's guitar and composing skills are comparable to those of Andy Summers, Pat Metheny, Lee Ritenour, and Larry Carlton, as well as fellow independent newcomers such as Devin Rice and Erin Aas.\n\nThe rich, full sound of the CD is fleshed out by an amazing lineup of musicians, among them - to name just a very few - Tony Levin (John Lennon, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, Andy Summers) on bass, Jeff Haynes (Pat Metheny) on percussion, Jeff Oster on flugelhorn, and Charlie Bisharat on violin, with enchanting wordless vocals provided by Claytoven Richardson and Noah Wilding. Album producer Will Ackerman of Windham Hill Records and Private Music fame also lends his guitar and piano talents separately to a couple of tracks.\n\nSacred Love is an album that will satisfy many musical palates, not just those of guitar music fans. Shambhu is an artist to keep a close eye on. Hopefully this is the first of many more wonderful new albums to emerge from his creative vision.","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"With all the controversy that sorrounds him, plus a roller coaster personal life, I wonder, how on planet earth does he continue to produce these kind of records for himself and others?. I think the blessings of GOD himself is upon him!!!.\nI own all of R.KELLY'S albums and this one is one of, if not, the very best of them all!!. From the instrumentless \"LOVE LETTER PRELUDE\" to \"YOU ARE NOT ALONE\" a tribute to MICHAEL JACKSON, the album is perfect from start to finish!!.\nStanout songs are: \"LOVE LETTER\", \"NUMBER ONE HIT\",\"LOST IN YOUR LOVE\",\"I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH\", oh I realy love this one, it have a MARVIN GAYE effect!.\"TAXI CAB\" didn't fare too well with me, \"RADIO MESSAGE\" is so pleading in it's essence, great work!. \"WHEN A WOMAN LOVES\" is in a school by itself!! it gives a PERCY SLEDGE effect, wow!! KELLS was singing his heart out here!!. I love this song with my entire bieng!!. \"LOVE IS\" with K MICHELLE is so heartwarming so classy, I love it too. \"JUST LIKE THAT\", \"MUSIC MUST BE A LADY\" are both supreme efforts, each song is absolute!. Oh my let's not forget \"A LOVE LETTER CHRISTMAS\" and \"the painful \"HOW DO I TELL HER?\" again, absolution abounds!!.\nAfter ten years, some artists vanishes or simply burn out, but for R.KELLY,after twenty years,like fine wine, he keeps getting stronger!!. I highly recomend this modern classic to all who want to feel great music!.It will take you way back,then brings you to the front!!!.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Adrian Younge and Ghost mesh well, and you won't find these kinds of sounds or this sort of narrative concept anywhere else in hip hop. I'm psyched by the level of creativity, originality, and general don't-give-a-f-ness that we're seeing in Wu veterans like Ghost and Inspectah Deck (via Czarface).\n\nAs a follow-up to part 1, I think this album falls a little short. Whereas a much broader cast of Wu-Tang players came through and crushed it on part 1, this time Raekwon is the only other Wu-Tang member to drop in. As a result, this album lacks the diversity and energy of the first. Go back to part 1 and listen to Deck and Masta Killa's verses. Listen to U-God just come out of nowhere and spazz out on \"Murder Spree.\" Although solid in their own right, none of the Rae and Ghost songs here achieve the same kind of freshness or vitality.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Let It Be Known, Oh You Bring, Journal\n\nWith her big, attention-drawing, booming voice, Casey J could make the reading of the phone book sing.  She could have opted for a sinecure by churning out yet another Gospel album.  And she could still be able to shift a truckload of CDs off the shelves.  Rather, with her debut live album released via Marquis Boone Enterprises \/Tyscot Record, Casey has taken to select worship songs that are embracing of her diverse audience.  Never one to be stymied in a genre, here you will find Casey J wrapping her India Arie-seque vocals around some soul-infused numbers, rising up to the rock infused sounds of worship, and thumbing out her best and the most spirited Gospel call-outs.  Further, unlike many worship leaders who see themselves more as rock stars indulging in their own compositions, throughout the record, Casey J gets the congregation engaged in two ways.  First, she made sure that her new compositions are interspersed with familiar worship anthems. Second, Casey J doesn't just sing, she leads.  She engages the congregation in worship such that we are not just spectators but she inspires us to worship along too.\n\n\"The Truth\" isn't the Casey J first exposure as a singer.  She started as one quarter of the gospel girl group 4LOVE.  Together, they were featured on The Brown Boyz' Top 30 hit \"Better Dayz\" in the spring of 2012. They also made some noise with the concept music video for their bouncy radio tune \"Praise.\"  Praise has been an essential part of Casey J's life from the start. Both her mother and grandmother Dorothy Mae sang in the gospel choir at Lily Hill Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.  \"The Truth\" is however Casey J's debut live album that she recorded earlier in the year live at the Fresh Start Church in Duluth, GA.  The night got off a good start as Casey J knocks off racial and international boundaries with her pulverizing vocals as she renders a rousing stadium rock version of British band Worship Central's \"Let It Be Known.\"\n\nThis is followed by the title cut \"The Truth,\" which is one out of seven cuts on the album co-penned by Casey J herself.  With a thumping beat and a bullet-train melody, \"The Truth\" is a doctrine affirming song that makes declaration some of the truths about Jesus articulated through the pages of Scripture.  Gospel artist Jason Nelson (who recently scored a #1 with \"I Am\") adds his grainy tenor to Casey J's multi-octave croon on the crescendo building prayer of surrender \"Have Your Way.\"  Most refreshing is Casey J's take of Hillsong UNITED's \"Oh You Bring.\"  While the original suffers from Matt Crocker's somehow muffled vocals, Casey J adds command and clarity to this ode to how God opens us to the truth of Christ's sacrifice.  Not never one to neglect her Gospel roots, Casey J throws back to the past when she invites her 84-year-old grandmother Dorothy Mae Choates to sing the hymn \"No Not One\" with her.\n\n\"Fill Me Up,\" a Jesus Culture original, finds Casey J taking her time to invoke God's presence calling to mind the awe-inspiring moments when the prophet Elijah called up fire to consume the sacrifices in 1 Kings 17.  Taking a recess from the big sounds is \"Journal.\"  On this piano ballad, Casey J gets introspective as she sings a personal love song to Jesus of how he pieced her life together despite her failings.  This is one ballad that will stop us in our tracks with Casey J's sobering honesty and heartfelt passion.  Thus, what gives \"The Truth\" depth and dimension is that this is a worship album that is upward reaching towards God, yet inward searching delving into our souls.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"OneRepublic hit it big when their song Apologize became the biggest song of the year; the track still gets prominent airplay even today, four years later. No followup single ignited quite the way that one did, with Stop and Stare being the only real success on Billboard. This time around, the band doesn't even try to replicate Apologize, which is a good thing. The beats are a bit harder and deeper, but not altogether dissimilar to Dreaming Out Loud. What results is an album that peaks high and doesn't so much dip low as just fade into facelessness.\n\nMade For You: The opening track is solid, though not all that memorable. The hook is catchy, but the added outro is unnecessary and doesn't add much. C+\n\nAll The Right Moves: The lead single sounds like nothing from Dreaming Out Loud, making it a great song to introduce this album. The vocals are urgent and the beat is great, but it's not particularly epic. B\n\nSecrets: The second single, and the best song on the album. The subtle beginning sparks and then ignites with the chorus, which is as catchy as anything OneRepublic has ever released. This should've been more successful. B+\n\nEverybody Loves Me: A very odd song for this band to record, but very welcome. The beat is different, focusing on more percussion, and the whole thing is just fun with the ego in overdrive. A-\n\nMissing Persons 1 & 2: Just as some momentum was forming, this stops the hooks dead. This isn't a bad song, but there's absolutely nothing exciting about it. C-\n\nGood Life: A great song to recover with. The third song on the album to eclipse anything the band has done thus far, with a quiet melody that is very pleasant. B+\n\nAll This Time: While too similar in rhythm to the previous song, the hook saves this track from obscurity. Not too great, but not bad either. C+\n\nFear: Another song that recycles the beats of the previous song. The vocals are pretty strong, but this just isn't original enough. C\n\nWaking Up: The same thing can be said for this track. This could have been merged with the previous two tracks without much hassle. C\n\nMarchin On: Barely different from the previous two, and the same in nature lyrically to the previous. This is getting a bit ridiculous. C\n\nLullaby: This song was written to be sleep-inducing, and it does the job. I'm just not sure what the purpose that has on an album. D\n\nMercy (Bonus): Previously on the first album, this is a much better end to the album than the previous song is on the regular edition. This deserved more success as a single. B\n\nThis album is incredibly frustrating, due to how much potential was wasted. The first half is solid for the most part, but it seems like Ryan Tedder loves the beat on Good Life and decided to replicate it in very similar ways on the four songs that followed. Lullaby refuses to put a flailing album out of its misery, and this all equates to a 'singles' album. Combine four of these songs with the singles from Dreaming Out Loud, and that will get you a lean, solid OneRepublic release. As for this, it should be skipped.\n\nRecommended: All the Right Moves, Secrets, Everybody Loves Me, Good Life","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"I know that I may get some thumb downs for this but I review So Hott by Kid Rock as a woman who also likes music by Beyonce (I mention this because there was supposedly a listed feud between Kid Rock and Beyonce via a 2014 or 2015 interview he did but I really think that he secretly admires Beyonce as a musician yet was trying to convince himself otherwise). Anyhow,So Hott by Kid Rock seems to be a hard core rock song about basically wanting to only know someone on an extremely casual level (due to a connection based more on a physical attraction and their perceived good looks and\/or beauty).  The guitar riffs to So Hott bring the song alive as well as his unapologetic and unabashed singing with the daring lyrics. The online music video to So Hott by Kid rock even fits close to the meaning of the song. I first heard the So Hott rock song around 2008 when I was living in Norfolk Virginia (through the U.S. Navy).","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Currently Emilie Autumn's image\/music tends towards... well, the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque, industrial-goth-doll. But her debut album had a vastly different flavor -- while it has the same dark edges and spatterings of industrial rock here and there, \"Enchant\" is a more romantic, Victorian\/medieval album.\n\nIt opens with an ethereal, twinkly expanse of sound, and Autumn intoning the first four lines from Shakespeare's 53rd sonnet. Then she launches into a starry rendition of her own poetry: \"Across the sky\/I will come for you\/If you ask me to\/Demystify\/Your uncommon dreams\/Stranger things have come true...\"\n\nThat opening song may give you the impression that Autumn is a sort of Delerium\/Enigma artist, but she quickly proves that it's not the case. Instead, she dabbles in a little of everything: hard-rock in \"Chambermaid\" and the blaring \"Heard It All,\" some spacey jazz in \"Second Hand Faith,\" rambling piano ballads in \"Castle Down\" and \"Ever,\"  dramatic string-soaked ballads in \"If You Feel Better\" and \"Save You.\" It ends with the satiny \"Epilogue: What If,\" which just reinforces that Autumn is not someone you can pin easy labels on: \"What if I'm a snowstorm burning\/What if I'm a world unturning\/What if I'm an ocean, far too shallow, much too deep?\"\n\nAmong the best songs are a trio of pop songs  which have a sort of medieval\/fairy-tale flavor: \"Rapunzel\" is a bittersweet song about... well, Rapunze; and \"Juliet\" is an exquisite, glittering swirl about... well, Juliet. And \"Rose Red\" swings between a spiky pop sound (\"Tell me no stories and I'll tell you no lies\/No one wants to hurt me\/but everybody tries!\") and a luscious ye-olde one (\"Rose Rose Rose Red\/Will I ever see thee wed?\/Only if you can capture me\").\n\nI probably could have guessed that \"Enchant\" was Autumn's first album without even checking wikipedia -- it sounds like she was experimenting with different styles and trying to figure out which one fit her best. You can hear some romantic goth, classical, hard-rock, jazz and a bit of Regina Spektor's anti-pop here. But \"Enchant's\" different styles flow easily into one another.\n\nThis is mainly because of Autumn's classical musical skills -- she winds silken strings of piano and violin around almost every song, along with some shimmering keyboard and the occasional blasts of electric guitar. The entire album has a sort of rock'n'roll Victorian-romantic flavor, and quite frankly that combination is something I wish there was more of.\n\nHer voice is also very lovely and versatile: she can sound punky, angelic, or low and powerful. And her lyrics and poems are very evocative and atmospheric (\"But would you tear my castle down\/Stone by stone\/And let the wind run through my windows\/'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose\"), and tinged with a sense of bittersweet romance.\n\nWhile it explores various musical styles, \"Enchant\" has a distinctive flavor that shows off Emilie Autumn's talents -- and leaves you wanting to see whatever else she's produced.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Usually, a Tracy Chapman song is urbane, in a quiet understated hip way, with a slice of wit. \"Talkin' Bout A Revolution\" is not that. Although it has become popular as an anthem in her concerts and covered by several artists, it is thin from start to finish.\n\nTrying to address real problems (poverty apparently, but not clearly, due to oppression), Chapman's lyrics have nothing original about them. She released this as the second single of her career. Considered political aware, it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Wasting time in the unemployment lines\nSitting around waiting for a promotion.\"\n\nShe whispers \"It sounds like a whisper.\"\n\nAnd she fills in space by repeating \"Run Run Run Run...\"\n\nThe music is sharply produced, but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat.\n\nTracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song. She has a better catalog than this.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"It's been four years already since Dokken's last studio album, 2008's Lightning Strikes Again (unless you count the 2010 re-recorded Greatest Hits album) and now they're back on the attack with their new album Broken Bones. In any case it's nice that Don carried on with Dokken even with different lineups and changes even though the 1980's work will always be what the band is known for, there has been some good material since then. Broken Bones is Dokken in 2012 sounding the best they possibly can and they don't disappoint. The band delivers an amazing album and everything that made Dokken Dokken it's here and I suspect a few will be surprised by how much this rocks and how good it is. This is one of the few albums where you can say it's a band's best since (insert year or time) ____ and you know it's true.\n\n\"Empire\" starts the album with a massive bang. It's so heavy, direct, in your face and manages to be catchy at the same time. It's a impressive song and to see that Dokken can still do this at this point is impressive, it's certainly among the heaviest they've ever done up there with stuff like \"Tooth And Nail\" and \"Mr. Scary\". The title track follows and is a little more Dokken sounding, it rocks; it's undeniably catchy and melodic with some neat lyrics. \"Best of Me\" has those harmonies the band was known for in the 1980's and that I loved so much about them. It's probably my favorite song on Broken Bones it's heavy and everything Dokken is supposed to be and sound like and then some.  \"Blind\" has this great crushing riff and \"The Victim of the Crime\" has this great slow groove and riff that makes it sound almost egyptian. \"Burning Tears\" is a slow rocker that is almost a ballad but not quite, it's one of the highlights for me. The chorus, the vocals done in a way that only Dokken can being so ever catchy.\"Today\" is the only full blown ballad here, and it's not even a power ballad like the band had success with in the 80's. Although it's not a bad song and it's an acoustic, slower placed oneit just sounds like Dokken's been singing this song before but with slightly different words.\"Fade Away\" is another track I love, Don sounds as good as he can on that chorus and I guarantee that when he says \"..., my love\" it sticks in your head which is not a bad thing, it's a strong song. \"Tonight\" goes back to heaviness of the opening \"Empire\" a bit and I'm glad that they chose an up tempo rock song to end the album on. To be honest \"Waterfall\" is one of the only song that I feel is a bit of a let down and not as good as the rest.\n\nOf course Don doesn't hit the high notes anymore and obviously his voice problems have been much talked about and him not being able to hit those notes anymore (smoking didn't help but he went through vocal correction surgery) , but for a man of 60 if you cut him some slack he sounds rather good. It's a little unfair to compare him to his peak era at this point, even though it's hard not to. Here though it sounds as if he's found a way to make effective use of his voice and not come across as \"he used to be...\" and I'm guessing part of that is the backing vocals helping but it works.  The band backing him up sounds tight. John Levin provides good riffs and solos and I think he surpasses himself this time around, he stepped in for George Lynch who is hard to forget but at this point I don't miss Lynch that much (and it's unlikely there will ever be a reunion, soon or ever). He plays with feel and soul, yet he shreds, riffs, he really does it all and it sounds fantastic. \"Wild\" Mick Brown is again behind the drums hitting hard, and bassist Sean McNabb makes his debut on a Dokken studio album. That rhythm section works rather well. The band sounds on fire, energetic and heavy, all great elements to make a neat Rock\/Metal record, and it works. The backing vocals have always been a weapon for Dokken, they were always so catchy and melodic they were distinguishable and that is in effect here as well to rather nice effects. The harmonies, the hooks it's all here and it sounds amazing for the most part.\n\nBroken Bones is said to be the last Dokken album, I don't know if it is but if it's true then I think it's a good farewell record and a nice thank you note to the fans that have been there all those years. There have been great Dokken albums and some not so great but this is one that Don can bow out with and be proud as he ends on a high note. They've had a great run for over a decade with a string of solid releases since a  while now. Broken Bones is everything it promises to be and more, it's a great Dokken record certainly one if not the best since 1987's Back For The Attack (I'd have to listen to all the post 1980's work again, but BB is up there) an doesn't disappoint. It felt like Lightning Strikes Again was getting there but this exceeds it.  It's quickly becoming one of my favorite Dokken albums. If you are or if you've ever been a Dokken fan pick up Broken Bones. 4.5*\/5.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This release is from a show recorded on Friday December 12, 1969 at a place that was briefly called the Thelma which little is known about. It was located on the Sunset Strip near the Whiskey. I knew someone up until about 8 months ago who caught the band quite a few times between 1966 and 1972 in the area and he couldn't remember the place (hey Gary H. if you read this). This was the third show in a three night stand with Steve Stills showing up at the first show on the 10th. Various parts of these shows have shown up in trading circles for decades. Even odder is that while some of the songs on the audience versions match the soundboard versions, others do not.\n\nAs for this show itself, the first 45 minutes were missing from the vault for many years although a passable version turned up in trader's circles a few years back. The show opens with a grooving Cold, Rain and Snow and a rocking Me And My Uncle. Both Easy Wind and Next Time You See Me are taken at a slow pace with Pig and Jerry singing harmony on Next Time. There are great early versions of newer songs like Black Peter, Dire Wolf, High Time, Casey Jones and the newish combo of China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider mixed in with older songs like He Was A Friend Of Mine. The show is brought to a screeching finale with a massive jam of Alligator>Caution>Feedback>We Bid You Goodnight. If you were fortunate enough to get the bonus disc subscription, then you have massive versions of Dark Star>Saint Stephen>The Eleven>Cumberland Blues and That's It For The Other One>Cosmic Charlie.

But sadly, his music after his fame just hasn't been as strong as what he had before. Anyone trying to make a sense of the King Of Pop had before, is really not delivering in heart as well as in voice. A Place With No Name, which originally was planned to be released on the wasted Invincible album doesn't actually ignite a fire as much as what Michael had when he had sampled songs like You Rock My World. The take, on using America's standard song Horse With No Name feels like it lags at heart and rhythm. I really found the song to lack what The King Of Pop showed musically and vocally.

{"text":"Somehow it took my good and oft referenced friend Henrique to point out to me that the sheer bulk of this three CD set consisted of 33 songs to represent the 33 years that Funkadelic have released any music. Just about anything connected to George Clinton and P-Funk is extremely complex. And that's in both musical and legal terms as well. Considering George Clinton put out his (to many) long awaited autobiography to coinside with this release? This comeback itself was complicated. First it was released digitally,and than in a CD package that seemed to put up in different record stores at different times-at least to my own personal observation anyway. Of course the major fact is a lot of P-Funk's key instrumental players have passed since the last released Funkadelic album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Electric-Spanking-of-War-Babies\/dp\/B000003B1F\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Electric Spanking of War Babies<\/a>. Among them are Cordell \"Boogie\" Mosson,Garry Shider,Glen Goins,Tiki Fulwood,Phillipe Wynne,Jessica Cleaves and of course Mister Maggot Brain himself Eddie Hazel. But the question on my mind remained how would Clinton,Bootsy,Junie,P-Nut and the few remaining original members make any sense from all this chaos?\n\n  \"Baby Like Fonkin' It Up\" begins this album with a groove that sounds a bit off musically-very lowly mixed instrumentation and upfront vocal choruses. \"Get Low\" and \"Not Your Average Rapper  basically deal with a modern hip-hop\/pop type dance number with a lot of programmed drum machines and on the latter a slower,slogging live drum beat.  \"If I Didn't Love You\",with it's spare bass and light keyboard harmony based instrumentation as well as stretched out improvised numbers such as \"F***** Up\",\"In Da Kar\" and \"I Mo B Ydog Fo Eva\" are all very hi hat spacey jazz fusion oriented pieces. \"Ain't That Funkin' Kind Hard On You\" and \"Radio Friendly\" bring back that most popularly known P-Funk sound of blipping melodic \"video game\" style synthesizers. \"Creases\" has the slower end of that sound only minus the synthesizers.  The title song is a very tribal African dance percussion type number while  \"Rollar Rink\",\"Nuclear Dog Part II\",\"Old Fool\",\"Pole Power\",\"Boom Here We Go Again\" \"Zip It\" and \"Catchin' Boogie Fever\" all keep that classic P-Funk danceable synthesizer oriented sound going right along.\n\n  On the rockier end of the album \"Jolene\" has a bluesier groove about it along with the guitars while \"Dirty Queen\" basically melds together edgy speed metal with a grungy guitar flavor.  \"Talking To The Wall\",\"Where Would I Go\" and especially my favorite of this area \"As In\" are all wonderfully instrumentally layered slow jams. \"Bernadette\" takes the Holland\/Dozier\/Holland Motown classic and reworks it in a manner that goes with the slow crawling blues\/gospel style of the earliest Funkadelic albums-reflecting the songs George Clinton composed while working for Motown-with the long instrumental jam to close out. \"Meow Meow\" is a sexually charged crawl focused on a reversed rhythm\/drum track.  \"The Naz\" features a very deep bass\/guitar driven groove powered by Sly Stone revisiting his classic DJ shtick in his elderhood.  \"Yesterdejavu\",\"The Wall\",\"Snot N' Booger\" and \"Dipety Dipety Doo Stop The Violence\" are all elaborate cinematic psychedelic soul numbers-all with heavy bottoms b but yet a modern production twist as well.\n\n  It's difficult for anyone with as long a history with listening to P-Funk such as myself to be at all subjective about new releases from them. So I'll just elect to say what I feel. After all,that is also what George Clinton's vision is all about. The pluses of this album IS that there is a lot of music. It allows old and new Funkadelic members to be able to explore a pretty broad range of ideas and for George himself to both come up with new material. The minuses go with the fact this album has some material that doesn't quite coincide with how Funkadelic fit into the P-Funk cannon. And it doesn't even matter that many of these songs feature Fred Wesley,when the original Funkadelic didn't generally have horns. A good chunk of these songs feature modern style grooves that I'd think George Clinton would consider \"placebo syndrome\"-many of them shamelessly using auto tune. Sometimes however? There are indications this is a massive musical satire-using a modern musical quality to prove a point against it. Conceptually it is also quite a bit sadder than most other Funkadelic I've heard. George and company seem to be of the opinion that art has become so reduced down to committee thinking that any expression of quality will have to remain underground for a time. As contradictory and lyrically dour as this album can occasionally be? Have to say it's all worth it just to have Funkadelic back with more quality funk and other grooving hybrids than not.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This is one of the most moving gospel hymns I've heard in a while. I don't know why it's taken me so long to find it. The moment you hear Tasha testify in the power of the Lord's name, his army rising, and finally to end with shackles falling... you are moved to tears, jump, shout, to break the chains of your own life.\n\nThe song is simplistic and powerful. The only draw back for me: Tasha asks the audience to speak to the chains in their lives... and the first thing out her mouth is speaking against the spirit of homosexuality... and in the same breathe she speaks against depression and rejection. I can't presume to know what she was thinking, but i do know may who identify as GLBT who struggle with the same sense of depression and rejection from many parts of society. Though the message confuses me, it is the religious doctrine shouted at in most pulpits. Ultimately, my point is to love thy neighbor AND still break the shackles in your life.\n\nThis song still gets my stamp of approval.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I'm a new fan to Marina And The Diamonds. I purchased \"Electra Heart\" after hearing most of the songs off of Pandora radio. Although I wasn't too keen on her sound at first, it grew on me the more I listened to her lyrics and quite breathtaking voice.\n\nThe songs she makes are very pop oriented but don't be fooled by its sugary sweet sound, her lyrics delve into some of the darker aspects of life, self loathing, heartbreak, even suicide. This isn't too say her music is an examination of just that, but she's not afraid to cover issues and send it down with a spoonful of sugar.\n\nI would definitely recommend listening to \"Electra Heart\" before \"FROOT\" if you're maybe on the fence about Marina as an artist but for current fans, this is a continuation of what Marina does best, giving infectious tunes with that same dark humor and sarcasm that is endearing and strong all at once. I'm actually proud to say that I turned my boyfriend into a fan by playing \"I'm a Ruin\" and \"Immortal\" off of this album.\n\nThose two tracks are by far my favorites but some other great songs are the title track \"Froot\", it's an homage to disco and it describes a woman's sexual nature to that of fruit. It's easily one of my favorites. I wouldn't change a single tune on this album and I could play it back to back for days, that's actually what I've done. Enjoy this album and it's wit and insights into life, love, being a woman, being a human being, wanting perfection but being flawed. You won't regret it.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"From the Freshman XXL class of 2014 comes Troy Ave with his debut album \"Major Without a Deal\". He has always had a very high sense of pride & the title clarifies that. He constantly states that he has brought that NY Hip-Hop sound back on the map, but for me it never went away (I am from NY & prefer that sound). So this was an easy listen for me. The production is done very well & his lyrics are on par & he even experiments with a little singing on a few tracks (he's no Drake) that I could have done without but it does add a little more diversity to the project overall. The features are proper as well so he def succeeded in terms of releasing a pretty dope album but it's the classic that he says that it is. If you are a fan of Troy you won't be dissapointed & I recommend it if you are tired of mainstream gimmicky stuff & looking for something more authentic.

The opening title track provides the quicker paced, rocking opener that kickstarts the album, while \"Tripping a Blind Man\" showcases the band displaying how utterly murky they can sound.  \"The Profit of Doom\", \"She Burned Me Down\", and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" are all great as well; providing just about everything that longtime Type O Negative fans want to hear.  That being said, there's not really anything here that sets itself apart from past material, and when it comes to past albums like \"Slow, Deep, and Hard\", \"Bloody Kisses\", and \"October Rust\"; \"Dead Again\" just can't compare.

{"text":"This is one where I'm rating it pretty much based on value.  This is one of 7 \"Rise of the Masters\" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were\/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their\/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering \"Is this working right?\" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Shinedowns vocalist Brent Smith and guitarist Zach Myers strip down and unplug to cover several classics and their choices are surprising and broad ranging from contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You), old school 80s rock (Phil Collins slow-build In the Air Tonight and Bon Jovis classic Wanted Dead Or Alive), and Seattle grunge (Pearl Jams Black).  For some reason they decided to split up their Acoustic Sessions into two parts and the first entry  is even more diversified but if I had to pick a favorite between the two I would go with this second, shorter session due to the strength of the Adele coververy moving and strong and I don't even listen to Adele; does anyone else want to see these two maybe perform a duet?and PJs impassioned tune.  I was surprised that my least favorite track was the one I anticipated being my favorite as I have always really enjoyed the slow-burn power of In the Air Tonight but with the percussion and in spite of their best efforts to provide that rising punch its just not there.  There are ten songs over the two releases and this second release accounts for four of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Early in that year \"Upright (Everything's Alright)\" hit #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 while in the summer Stevie's moving version of Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' In The Wind\" would peak at #9. In November 1966 Motown released \"A Place In The Sun\". Written by Ronald Miller and Bryan Wells it was one of Wonder's first songs to contain social commentary. I really never stopped to think about it before but Stevie Wonder was only 16 years old when he recorded this tune. Amazing!  This is a beautiful song that gives each and every one of us a little something to ponder.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Alright, listen to the lyrics for this one. First of all, I can't tell whether this is about a boy she has serious anger issues with, or whether this is about a child-abuser. The latter would make the song more powerful in a lyrical sense, the former on the other hand, would just make the song wrong all the world around. But, in either case, Clarkson does a poor vocal performance here, and somebody totally messed up on giving this song a tune. It's so bad, it verges on mind-numbing, and annoying. And after you've heard the song ten times on radio, in the same morning, you'll verge on convulsions and other serious medical and mental issues. Yes, it's that bad.\n\nOh by the way, Reba didn't help the song any. In fact, she just made it worse, as if that was even possible. In fact, that version could be the worst excuse for a duet I've ever heard. In either case, with either song, don't buy it. Keep your sanity, and keep your ears.","classification":1,"fold":9}

{"text":"If you've played the game Halo 3: ODST, then you know that the atmosphere of this sidebar title in the Halo Series is fairly bleak.  You spend most of your time in an empty city that has been upended by an alien invasion.  Civilians are long gone, your fellow soldiers' bodies litter the streets, and the alien dropships seem to be making deliveries nonstop.\n\nThe game is excellent, and its melancholy score is part of the reason:  it sets a soft, sad tone and I found it oddly comforting to listen to.  I downloaded this MP3 album* from Amazon and discovered that with the weather serving me some gray rainy days, this made for soothing background music.  While there are parts where the military cadence of the Halo series ramps up, for the most part it is subdued, but pleasant.\n\nIf you enjoyed the ODST game, the soundtrack evokes the same mood.  I was happy to realize it fit well into my general background listening routine, too.\n\n*NOTE:  this product review was written for the MP3 download.

{"text":"This is a peculiar album. It contains many snippets; single movements of piano sonatas, a cobbled together violin sonata. The symphonies are either repeats of other albums or versions from lesser known orchestras. However, within that are some surprising gems. There are several woodwind chamber pieces, some of which are rarely heard. There are several nicely done violin sonatas by a well known Dutch violinist. There is a rarely heard large Mass in C major; very movingly done\n\nThe real gems are two orchestral pieces by William Furtwangler. T. Fisher has commented on the version of the 3rd symphony. More surprising to me is his recording of the Grosse Fuge with the strings of the Berlin Philharmonic. You need to put up with perhaps the poorest quality sound on the cloud, and a few German coughs; but stick with it. The power and contrasts are like no other version of this masterpiece. At over 18 minutes it is certainly the longest!\n\nThe price here is a real steal.

{"text":"I love this song and always have--it's a song you can listen to for decades still seeking the nuanced answers to the existential questions that it asks. We all have so many sub personalities inside of us, and some of us are a bit tortured by them. I love how this song asks the big questions (of the subject \"Gloria\"): what will she choose to do with her life and the possible consequences of certain choices. \"A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, Gloria, how's it gonna go down? Will you meet him on the main line, or will you catch him on the rebound? Will you marry for the money, take a lover in the afternoon? Feel your innocence slipping away, don't believe it's comin' back soon...\" Innocence lost cannot be regained. The lyrics of this song are rife with meaning and Laura Branigan sings so soulfully, with great emotion, that it is palpable. This is a great upbeat song dealing with shadow subjects of the reality of human life. Pure music brilliance + you can dance to it. I like to listen to this at the gym. It's a great song for when I'm feeling splendiforously happy or despairingly sad. Happy listening~*","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"If you're looking to pummel your senses, then this is the album for you.  Considered the leading doom metal band all across the globe, Electric Wizard carefully crafted another reminder that they have no intention whatsoever of relinquishing their throne.  My first Electric Wizard album was \"Black Masses,\" which I love for its heavy Black Sabbath influences (and who happen to be one of my all-time favorite bands), but \"Time to Die\" is another beast in itself.  Other reviewers have compared it to \"Dopethrone,\" which I have not yet heard, but this album is MUCH heavier than \"Black Masses.\"\n\nIn fact, the album is so heavy that the guitar, bass, and drums can be a little overwhelming.  The lyrics on several songs are practically indecipherable and wind up sounding like witches chanting (in a good way).  With the exception of \"Destroy Those Who Love God,\" \"SadioWitch,\" and \"Saturn Dethroned,\" every song on this album is either close to or over 10 minutes in length, which is enough to loosen even the sturdiest of brains.  And of course the band lays on the Satanic schtick, adding audio clips involving cult killings and the like throughout the album.\n\n\"I Am Nothing,\" \"We Love the Dead,\" \"SadioWitch,\" and \"Lucifer's Slaves\" are my personal favorite tracks, but you can't treat this the same way you would another album.  Listening to Electric Wizard is, in and of itself, a completely different experience than just simply listening to your average album.  Sometimes it requires dimming the lights, lighting some candles, burning some insence...you get the idea.  Now enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This collection isn't for the typical NIN fan (what, NO LYRICS?). It's also not for those who think instrumentals mean lame background music. Listening to this sounds like a bastard child of Aphex Twins, David Byrne & Brian Eno. The typical Trent Reznor use of distorted pianos and guitar used to link his songs in The Fragile are here, but with the shortness of each track, he challenges himself to come up with 40 different themes. It's like his own audio museum where you move from painting to painting. You recognize the brush strokes and the technique while the subject and colors are in constant transition. Like a painting, especially contemporary ones, they often require focus and concentration to get the most out of it. And like artists will do, occasionally a work fails to impress or the message gets lost in noise and distortion. But for the most part, Ghosts succeeds in staying fresh, suspenseful,  inventive, and imaginative. No you won't be humming these during your drive home or your morning workout. Trent wants to haunt your head, not to scare you. And in that regards, it works.","classification":4,"fold":9}

The album spawned four top ten hits, went to number one, spent almost a year in the top ten and over three years in the top 200.  Part of the band's appeal lays in the fact that they seem like just an average bunch of guys who could live in your neighborhood or play on your local softball team.  The songs on Sports are straight ahead, no nonsense songs that full of picture perfect harmonies and appealing hooks.  \"The Heart of Rock 'N' Roll\" opens up the album and sets the tone with its roll call of towns and its catchy chorus.  \"Heart & Soul\" is a jumping song with it's pounding guitars and punchy lyrics. \"Bad Is Bad\" shows off the band's slick harmonies in a southern fried soul style song.  \"I Want A New Drug\" maybe the band's most recognizable song and is just about as perfect a pop song as you can record.  \"Walking On A Thin Line\" tackles the serious subject of Vietnam Vets dealing with coming home from the war, but does so in a manner that is not self righteous or aggrandizing.  \"Finally Found A Home\" has a swift and pulsating pace while \"If This Is It\" is a bright and sunny track remiscant of The Beach Boys.  \"You Crack Me Up\" is a frenzied number and \"Honky Tonk Blues\" is a cover of a Hank Williams song in which the band lets loose.  The additional tracks are all fine, but the original nine tracks that made up Sports stand out on their own.  The album has sold over ten million copies and is one the finest albums that was released in the 80's.","classification":5,"fold":9}

It is still one of those songs that really connects with celebration. Prince was definitely a gem that really transcended music at the soul, where a lot of other artists have stopped.

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

{"text":"This is a review of \"Miami pop festival\" the Jimi Hendrix experience. I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight, before it's true release. So I have listened to it twice and here is my take: for $9.99, this is a three star purchase. There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi, which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s. This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang, of pre-Woodstock fame.\n\nThe songs on this live disc come mainly from \"Are You Experienced...?\" even though it's mid '68. The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier.  Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of \"hey Joe.\" The solo in this song really kicks. The next song, Foxy Lady, blasts off. The intro contains a whole lotta Uni-Vibe and phasing. One nice aspect is that the mixes, which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight.\n\n The next song \"Tax-free\" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout. Noel Redding's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place, sonically speaking. Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah-wah guitar. The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining, as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early, nascent  stages of festival going.\n\n I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about. What else can be said about this process? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive. Most of it has already been heard many times over. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, of course, ending up with products like \"Valleys of Neptune \"which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen. So with all of that said, this is a decent product. In fact it is rather good for a live recording. The only problem is the lack of material. The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling.\n\nThe accompanying booklet with photographs that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done. The packaging is actually quite nice as well. So for $10, this is a marginal three-star buy. Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list, like Paul McCartney's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe. The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts (aka \"Rock of Aged\"). That one is a great example of a lame cash grab. Sad for such an amazing group. Ive heard NOTHING good about it!\n\nPS-I would listen to this a million times before ever suffering through friggin' ARCADE FIRE and their Ambien-rock-electronic crap that Rolling Stone seems to love so much.

{"text":"I've been around long enough to have heard many bands from which Joywave have taken their musical cues. So, this music is far from being original. But, I see there are some young reviewers who have given this debut five stars. I just can't do that. This band has a ways to grow before I'd give this five stars. Five stars is classic, landmark, cornerstone recording. Is this \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\"? Is this \"The Joshua Tree\"? Is this \"Dark Side Of The Moon\"? No, no, and no.\n\nJoywave sound like they're trying too hard here. I guess I thought their debut would be better based on the song \"Tongues\". When I heard that song months ago, I sat up and said, \"Who's this?\" There was something about that track that reminded me of the best 80's New Wave bands with a modern twist. But when I bought \"How Do You Feel Now?\" I was greeted with \"Somebody New\" and \"Carry Me\" opening the album. Neither of those tracks did for me what \"Tongues\" did. \"Destruction\" was interesting for a minute but quickly turned annoying. \"Now\" was okay. \"Parade\" and \"In Clover\" were okay. \"Feels Like A Lie\" and \"Traveling At The Speed Of Light\" were weak. Did we really need a seven minute meandering track like \"Traveling At The Speed Of Light\"? \"Nice House\" is, maybe, the only other track on this entire album that I felt came close to the interest I had in \"Tongues\". \"Bad Dreams\" was weak.\n\nSo, I once again say, this is a band who has potential, but it wasn't fully realized with \"How Do You Feel Now?\" I'm not sure they'll get the chance to make another album or two, but if they do, they need to go back to the drawing board and re-think their musical strategy.\n\n\"How Do You Feel Now?\" was just okay. It wasn't special or unique or innovative, but neither was U2's debut, \"Boy\", and look at how far they went. In the end, I give this album two and a half stars, which is being very nice--two and a half stars means half of five stars--or average. Just average.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"When it has came down to Elton John, he has definitively stood the test of time, more than any singer\/songwriter of the past 40 years. Still, his classics have never lost their luster after all this time. While it has been awhile since Elton released a solo song, since 2006's The Captain & The Kid, he hasn't stopped rolling with the fans young and old performing live nicely. Last year, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me became the unofficial song of sadness with so many losses in the music industry from Donna Summer to Levon Helm of The Band, as Elton made so many dedications to that song so many sadnesses. Home Again, Elton's latest song is simple and classic Elton style with the signature piano and mood. The song from his upcoming album The Diving Board is definitely one song that stands out tall. I like this song because it is down to Earth, and very true without many changes to his style. His style is still natural and brilliant. This is one song that will tide over any Elton John fan, until The Diving Board comes out.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Mary J. Blige follows \"The Breakthrough\" with \"Growing Pains\" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best, if not the best, albums of her career. She found her footing with \"The Breakthrough\" and any fears that she'd return with a cd that wasn't as strong should be put aside. \"Growing Pains\" has something for all of her fans and new ones, a sound that mirrors old R&B but also goes into territory that music seems afraid to venture into. After listening to the entire album, I found myself saying this was true quality. There isn't really a track to skip here; each song adds something to the mix and covers everything from a dance-vibe to a laid-back groove about love and loss.\n\nSome of the standout tracks are \"Work That\" which is one of the upbeat songs, \"Grown Woman\" that could be this albums \"Enough Crying\" with Mary dishing out her good qualities and what makes her stand out at this point in her life. \"Feel Like A Woman\" is a new kind of song for Blige where she puts aside her reservations about being with someone and shows her most vulnerable of traits in this ballad-like track. \"Stay Down\" stands as my favorite, another turn for Mary J. Blige as she's asking her man to stay through the troubles and paints a picture of better days in their relationship that are to come. \"Roses\" is another track, more hard in sound, with Blige proclaiming she's all right and doesn't need people telling her what's wrong with her. \"Fade Away\" and \"What Love Is\" both are tracks that stand out for their production and the feeling she evokes. In what's perhaps one of her best closing tracks, \"Come To Me (Peace)\", is a big R&B\/80s type of song that's a no-holds-barge explosion of sound and is moving and leaves you wanting more.\n\nIn all, \"Growing Pains\" is an absolute must own. Where most artist hit their peak at some point and become predictable, Mary J. Blige seems to be getting better with each year. The songs on this cd are fresh, original and yet sound different and a bit experimental for Blige as she matures into her new sound and comfort zone as an artist. Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":9}

She showed that so boldly on the last record, with songs like Rolling In The Deep and Set Fire To The Rain, but with all the hype around her 25 record, many people have just been geared mainly with one song in the mind, Hello, which really was a great song, but still she needed to be more than just one song to feel that people will buy toward her again. When We Were Young, the second single from 25 is definitely a really good song that shows she still has blossomed very nicely with the soul, and has not been overdrawn unlike other singers like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles who've been more products, not real singers.

You might find better performances of the individual works here (I'm partial to Ormandy in the symphonies and especially in the Symphonic Dances, Reiner in \"Isle of the Dead\", Janis & Reiner in Concerto #1 and Ashkenazy and Ormandy in Concerto #3) but so far (and I haven't listened to all 8 (or 9) hours), I've heard nothing here that isn't less than very good and you have a number of out of the way items, like the \"Youth\" Symphony and Prince Rostislav.  I was prepared to not be a fan of Abbey Simons' performances of the concertos, remembering how they sounded on some Turnabout LPs in the 1970s but they come up much better here and I really liked Concerto #4.\n\nSo go for it!

{"text":"'Lost In Time' matches one of the industry's greatest voices with some outstanding music and lyrics of 80s nostalgia that should *never* go out of style. Classic, soulful, and reflective, the CD conjures up summer memories of my childhood in the 80s. The influences of touchstone songs such as Cheryl Lynn's \"Got To Be Real\", The Stylistics' \"You Are Everything\", The O'Jays' \"Backstabbers\" and The Gap Band's \"Yearning For Your Love\" are heard throughout the CD.\n\nMy favorite songs are: \"Paid\" ft Eddie Levert, \"Always A Reason\", \"Stir It Up\", \"Good Life\", & \"Never Want To Live Without You\". I also enjoy his rendering of \"Better & Better\" originally done by Ms. Lalah Hathaway even if he brings nothing new to it.\n\nI gravitate to artists like R. Kelly, Cee-Lo, and Marsha Ambrosius who are making some great retro music. Eric Benet is no exception. On 'Lost In Time', Eric Benet finds his niche in the classic soul stylings of the past. This is an outstanding CD from beginning to end, and I am incredibly proud of him!","classification":5,"fold":9}

Usually people know what they are buying at least through a sample but this song is very good for those of us that have listened to ZZ Top since the 70's and HATE what the 80's and 90's did with them.\n\nThe song is about smoking meth from my best understanding, which I think is a stupid thing to do. You have to be an idiot to do use meth. But there are many historical songs about drug use that are not promoting the behavior, and I suspect this is one of those songs...just making an example of the behavior, not promoting it. These guys are so old, a hit of meth would kill any one of them, so I think they know that.\n\nYou have to get in to the mental weeds to understand all that, especially since the lyrics are about as seemingly random as can be and make virtually no sense...pretty much like the words of a meth head, which I think is the point of the song.\n\nDo not use illegal drugs especially idiotic drugs like meth. It will turn you in to an idiot if you actually survive.\n\nAll that said, this is a good song.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Last year, Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was \"With Teeth\" with \"Year Zero\", a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails' artistic high point, a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting.\nNow, only a year later, Nine Inch Nails and their leader Trent Reznor, who for all intents and purposes is Nine Inch Nails, have returned with the nearly two hour \"Ghosts I-IV\", a set of atmospheric instrumentals.\nNow, if you would have told me even two years ago that the words \"prolific\" and \"Trent Reznor\" would ever, EVER be mentioned in the same sentence I would have laughed at you. But apparently after getting sober and getting the awfulness of \"With Teeth\" out of his system the man is just that. A total of thirty six tracks, \"Ghosts\" is as sprawling in ambition as \"The Fragile\", even without the accompaniment of vocals.\nIn fact, this new, quicker working version of Trent Reznor works much better for the music than the one who would spend a good half a decade pain stakingly going over every note. Like \"Year Zero\" last year, there is an immediacy to \"Ghosts\" that previous NIN records lacked. Though the record is dense and layered, it is never overblown with needless tinkering and a million small little pops and bells and whistles that can be found on earlier NIN products.\nIt's also nice to see Reznor in a true collaborative spirit, as \"Ghosts\" is co-written by Atticus Ross and Alessandro Cortino, NIN's current keyboard player. The difference in perspective helps give this record a feel different of any previous Nails album.\nAnd let's all be honest with each other: the weakest point to any Nine Inch Nails record has always been the lyrical skills of Reznor. Usually clumsy, occasionally inane, Reznor lets the music do the talking for him this time, which is a nice plus.\nSo why only three stars for this record? Well, because at times \"Ghosts\" feels like a collection of ideas rather than songs. Though there is nothing awful on this record, there is also very little that is extraordinary, and it is too long for it's own good. The mood swings of the record are all complimented well, but too many song build and build and build and just stop, rather than fully taking off and entering someplace different and more interesting.\nIn fact, the best place to listen to \"Ghosts\" is probably in your car, late at night, driving home, where it can sink into your head but you're never really paying close attention to it.\nBut \"Ghosts\" is worth the purchase for sure. It's price, and the quality of good, if rarely great, music, and the fact that after almost twenty years Trent Reznor actually sounds like he's enjoying the process of making music.\nHopefully this is a series that he will continue to work on for many years to come.","classification":3,"fold":9}

The singer's voice is also very good and on most songs you will feel like humming along or singing along in your car or at home.  Track one expresses the effects of drugs on the singer's life, track two another good rock song with decent lyrics but personally prefer the live version found on the CD single \"Hit Me Like A Man.\"  Track 3 is a song you can't help but sing along to and relate to the lyrics at some point in your life \"I'll Never Be Good Enough\", track 4 is a song with strange lyrics but the singer is right about one main thing no matter how much we desire to change \"Can't Be Anything Else But Me.\"  Track 5 is another song you can hum along to and enjoy moving to the music but in the end she will get her revenge on those who hurt her, track 6 shows how much you want to numb out the pain, hurt, so you take anything to drown it out but for \"Just Tonight.\"  Track 7 shows how fast fame, fortune comes to your life, and then in blink of an eye it's turns you into \"Miss Nothing, track 8 is a song about the singer looking for her hero to save her from 'Going Down.\"  Track 9 is another song about trying to fill the void in your life but this time trying to find it in love, religion, or even fame in the form of \"Rock and Roll\", track 10 threw the pain and sorrow you need that special someone to help you get threw it and keep you going.

{"text":"I have grown so weary of people dissecting this album for flaws, repetitive beats, retro-ness, and the like. And I am especially sick and tired of people confusing this amazing artist's life with her art. Is Van Gogh's work any less important, or is it in any sense less amazing, because he had such bad emotional problems that he cut off his ear and shot himself in the chest twice--killing himself at 36? NO, NO, NO!\n\nI don't care how the artist, producers, button pushers, chalkboard scrapers, or anyone else involved in the making of the recording achieved the sound when it is this amazing. In my estimation, what really matters at the end of the day, is the way an album sounds, and this one is off the charts!\n\nThe songs on this album run the gamut from suicidal to exhilarated, playful to provocative, old school to new school, fawning to tempting, without ever skipping a beat. And then there is that voice--like Etta James, Billie Holliday, Bettye LaVette, and all The Supremes rolled into one beautiful ear candy confection---chased with a shot of tequila. And did I mention that she has the swagger and in-your-face attitude of another uniquely original artist--Madonna. I realize they are worlds apart musically, but the presence and panache that they both exhibit are what makes me draw the parallel. For better or worse, Amy has the f-you attitude that Madonna had when she was starting out. Say what you will about this woman, but there is no one else like her, and this album proves it in spades!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"'Silver and Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6-10,' the sequel to 2006's 'Songs for Christmas,' features nearly three hours of holiday cheer from the inimitable Sufjan Stevens. There are 58 tracks here, with about a third of them being entirely original compositions from what I can tell. Not to mention a rather odd cover of Prince's 'Alphabet Street' that still somehow fits the overall tone of the set, though it also would have fit perfectly on 'Age of Adz.'\n\nSufjan has the uncanny ability to be both depressing and uplifting at the same time, which comes through very well here. The mood of these tracks ranges from silly and cute to powerful and moving, with song styles that cover an extremely wide spectrum--shifting from chamber-folk to post-rock to electro\/dance--with more experimentation and use of electronics compared to the rather low-key, mostly acoustic first volume, providing a nice change of pace that keeps things fresh throughout the five discs, ensuring that it never gets old.\n\n\"Joy to the World\" is a great example, starting out very subdued and beautifully sung, slowly building with more and more effects until an all-out techno track busts out, turning the Christmas classic into a dancefloor number. The two epics here, \"The Child With The Star On His Head\" and \"Christmas Unicorn,\" both written by Sufjan, are extremely tripped-out, and make for perfect late-night headphone journeys. While not every song here worked for me, those that didn't were few and far between.\n\nI may not be the religious sort, but for the hour or so per sitting I spend listening to Sufjan's rather faith-based music--'Silver and Gold' included--I feel moved to the point where, for that short time, I'm into it and believe wholeheartedly. His music is just so honest and sincere that, even if your beliefs don't mesh with his, when you're absorbed in his music, they will. That's just about the highest praise I can give any singer-songwriter. There are only a handful that can pull the listener so deeply into their world that, for a little while, nothing else matters, you're so wrapped up in their stories. And Sufjan is able to do that even with Christmas songs we've all heard a thousand times.\n\nNow if that's not talent, I don't know what is.\n\n(FYI: I'm not sure about the mp3 download here, but the Bandcamp and iTunes versions come with a digital booklet that I'm unfortunately unable to access for some reason. The physical set, which I do not own, comes with an 80-page booklet filled with lyrics, liner notes, illustrations, childhood photos, temporary tattoos and such, so it's possible the digital version is similar, but I'm not positive.)","classification":4,"fold":9}

As her prior Hello and Twentythree paid witness, Prettyman is no slouch as a writer, but heartbreak now makes her melodies and words particularly incisive.  Songs like Second Chance or My Oh My channel her hurt into big choruses of affirmation that the real loser is he who left.  Just try not singing along.  Emotional shrapnel is worked through in songs like Deep Blue Ocean, as Prettyman channels Shelby Lynne and scales back to simple bass and pedal-steel, making the ache palpable.  The penultimate Rebound proffers a very frank assessment of exactly what a rebound is good for.  And in the closer, Never Say Never, Prettyman tries to sum up, but collapses into a mirror monologue to Mr. Gone.  Love hurts, a heart blurts, and art gleams in cedar and gold.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Before I said this CD was about average. It's not. It's just different. There is a bit of hip-hip mixed with R&B here but once you get past the good tracks and to the second half of the album it's full of excellent songs that are mid-tempos and beautiful ballads. Some of the highlights of the slower songs are \"That's What Love Is\" (my favorite song), \"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\",  \"Talk To Me\", \"If You Love Me\" (which sounds like it could have fit right in on her previous huge hit of a CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>) and even \"Come To Me (Peace)\" which ends the album on a slightly more upbeat and inspiring note. I think out of all of Mary's albums this is one of the most misunderstood. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Life\/dp\/B0000AQS8W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;some people just weren't digging this one. Honestly, L&L is one of my favorites by Mary. It was very downbeat for the most part and I think that's what people didn't like. Same thing happened here. More than half the album is slower and full of meaning and songs about relationship\/self-esteem up's and down's. The production on a few of the tracks is a little more Pop\/R&B than a lot of her earlier material too.\n\nSo even with certain differences I must admit that after listening again (just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Life\/dp\/B0000AQS8W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;album) I find that this is a great (and once again) underrated effort by Mary J.

It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads\/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts.

Beautiful effort.\n\n4.4 stars.\n\nDOWNLOAD:\n\"What Love Is\"\n\"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\"\n\"Stay Down\" &\n\"If You Love Me\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

Let's face it, people, this is a pop world, and to not be pop is to not be cool.  Like the Spice Girls and Madonna of a different age, Jewel is coming to grips with herself and her music through pop, and I, for one....oops, sorry - I just said that...\nWell, as I mentioned before, it takes true courage to be yourself and try a different sound.  From what I've heard of this album so far, there's lots of trip-hop, lots of dance, and totally lots of fun POP!!  I'm glad Jewel is no longer an Alaskan hippie, and is instead a girl with a new attitude!!\nYou go, girl.....the days of your white van are loooong gone!!!!\nSEE YA' LATER!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":9}

It isn't really about having the time of your life and how nice that was, but rather it's about regrets for having wasted the formative years and ending up in a dead-end job or relationship. The artist is saying he hopes the wasted listener had the time of his life, because that's the last of the good times. A little poetic justice as it were. You can't simply have \"the time of your life\" and subsequently hope to do better, because sooner or later the \"time\" ends and reality sets in. Best be ready for it!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Singles for albums are named that just for what they are...but lately in music (and Christian Music is not exempt from this) the single tends to carry the whole spirit and weight of the album with the rest being filler songs. Hopefully this will not follow that trend. This song was the song performed on Good Morning America to promote the film 'Son of God' movie back in February. While I didn't see that film and had questions about her endorsement of it, I have no question about this song! This is awesome! By the far one of the best Christian songs ever...and i listen to a whole lot of it! This song embraced a very poppy sound...not quite EDM or dubstep but more pop than her last two albums were. By the way, her Christmas album is good as well if you ever want to check that out. I just hope that her piano\/rock style hasn't  completely gone out the window but songs like this show she's not afraid to bridge new genres. It has sometimes been mistaken for a britt nicole crossover..and maybe so. I just hope some piano pieces like 'beautiful beautiful' from My Paper Heart are on this upcoming album. That song was what drew me into her music when i heard it at winterjam 2009. Overall, I recommend this song. However, if the whole album takes this approach, it will, at least to me be a tad bit disappointing. Could be britt nicole (2014 version) disquised as Francesca Battistelli...which wouldn't be a horrible thing...just not francesca battistelli album.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The man might not be blessed with the greatest voice of any singer, let alone singer\/songwriter, on the planet; but over a period of five different decades, Jimmy Webb has made an enormous impact on his profession, with an avalanche of songs that have been recorded by dozens and dozens of different artists over time, whether it has been the much reviled and misunderstood \"MacArthur Park\", or such monstrous Glen Campbell hits as \"Wichita Lineman\", \"Galveston\", or \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix.\"  And so, this son of an Oklahoma Baptist minister whose songwriting genius so many can and should still take notes from has managed to revive a lot of those songs again, with a little help from his friends, on JUST ACROSS THE RIVER.\n\nRecorded in Nashville for the most part, and utilizing that music community's folk\/country\/Americana session elites, Webb re-imagines all of his songs in this particular format; and even if some of his guests here are not known for being in that genre (such as Billy Joel, who helps on \"Wichita Lineman\"), it doesn't dissipate the final result.  Lucinda Williams does a good guest turn on \"Galveston\", even as her lazy Louisiana drawl of a voice is an admittedly acquired taste.  Glen himself reunites with his old friend for a sort of Nashville lounge version of \"Phoenix\"; Michael McDonald guests on \"Where Worlds End\" (whose lyrics provided this album's title); Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler's Dylanesque vocals and guitar are featured on \"Highwayman\" (the #1 C&W hit from 1985 for Highwaymen [Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, and Waylon Jennings]); and Willie himself helps out on \"If You See Me Getting Smaller.\"  Southern California rock stalwarts J.D. Souther (on \"I Was Too Busy Loving You\") and Jackson Browne (on \"P.F. Sloan\"), also do well.\n\nIt is really on the final track, however, a reworking of \"All I Know\", a Top 10 hit for Art Garfunkel in 1973, that things get quite poignant.  Here, Webb managed to get Linda Ronstadt, perhaps the best interpreter of his material after Glen Campbell, to harmonize with him, and not surprisingly it works.  At the same time, however, it's a bit sad to listen to in light of the possibility that this may be the last time anybody hears Linda's voice either on record or in concert.  Vocal problems supposedly caused by her two decade-long thyroid condition may have finally forced the Queen Of Country Rock to retire.  It would be a catastrophic tragedy if this were true, but even if it is, it is a fitting way to end her unbelievably long career by working with a favorite songwriter of hers.\n\nAll in all, this is a very rootsy experience into the heart of one of the greatest songwriters of the modern era, and it is really worth getting.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"It surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more unsung, than really soulful on radio. Unfortunately, Chrisette Michele has been one of those songstresses that does deserve more credit because of her soul from the voice alone, but somberly she has never gotten it, in the severe overexposure of others like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, whom are more products than people. Hard to believe that it has been a decade since she came out of the bloom with her debut album, I Am, and she still has had better music than most of the jokes on radio today. Sadly, Chrisette has such a beautiful soul but she still never has gotten the credit she deserves with her work. Her latest single, tries to show that Chrisette is going for a more modern R&B sound that really does work in her favor, where she has had several songs from the past few years not work in her favor. Unbreakable, the lead single from her 5th album Milestone, is short and simple but shows she is still making better songs than what is out there in radio today. This is a nice download if you have followed Chrisette Michele for the past decade, and if you really enjoy her work.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","classification":4,"fold":9}

This album is raw, his raps blend well with the different musics and beats and producers and he is just dynamite on the Dr. Dre-produced songs (even \"In Da Club\"). The ones that Eminem produced are just as solid too.  And his song \"21 Questions\" shows his softer side and pleasant compliments to the girl he's talking about on the song.  Better than hearing the heavy gun themes that dominate the album.  But his being from the streets justifies his stand in his songs' lyrics.

Over time, I became truly blown away by Amy's sweet, sexy, breath-y voice.  And in the course of 4 decades, it hasn't changed all that much -- it's slightly become deeper and much more mature.  And she also married guitarist Vince Gill in 1994 after they met for the duet on 1994's \"House Of Love.\"\n\nThis CD is a short overview of her work, which is mostly her mainstream hits -- from 1977 to 2003.  I actually own the deluxe version which has over an hour of bonus content, including 5 music videos and Amy's own interviews of the songs.  So now I will rate each song, which is in backwards chronological order.  :)\n\nSimple Things -- 5 stars; Takes A Little Time -- 5 stars; Lucky One -- 4 stars; House Of Love -- 4 stars.\n\nBaby Baby -- 5 stars; Every Heartbeat -- 4 stars; That's What Love Is For -- 4 stars; Good For Me -- 4 stars.\n\nI Will Remember You -- 5 stars; Lead Me On -- 4 stars; Saved By Love -- 4 stars; Stay For Awhile -- 5 stars.\n\nFind A Way -- 5 stars; Thy Word -- 5 stars; Angels -- 5 stars; El-Shaddai -- 5 stars; In A Little While -- 5 stars.\n\nMy Father's Eyes -- 5 stars; Old Man's Rubble -- 5 stars.\n\nAmy's most recent recording was 2013's \"How Mercy Looks From Here\".

{"text":"This is a decent song. It is very on-trend with the pop music that is out nowadays, and very within the vein of KP's 'empowerment anthems'. It kind of sounds like something that was left off of Teenage Dream. I can see that this was a song made to be put in some athletic commercial,  one of the leading songs for the Olympics (and possibly World Cup) or any sporting event, due to the stomping mid-tempo beat and the sort of shout-heavy chorus. It is just kind of weird that there are so many borrowed quotes in one song (Eye of the Tiger, I Am Woman, Staying Alive, Muhammad Ali), and rhyming cliches (I went from zero \/ to my own hero). And upon release there was already controversey that this song relates heavily to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Brave\/dp\/B00DRDSL4Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Brave<\/a>&nbsp;by Sara Bareilles. I can see this song being number one, but it lacks substance for me. Apparently Katy Perry is trying to come 'darker' with this album, but if Roar is any indication of what is to come, it really just sounds like a lackluster part two to Teenage Dream, or maybe its B-side. Also, the album art is very Lisa Frank-ish.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Crosby, Stills & Nash are the definitions of living legends. They have been called \"the first real supergroup\" (by more than one source, in fact) and one would certainly not be out of line saying that their harmony vocals are angelic. These guys are the real deal, plain and simple. The fact that they are still touring and are still attracting a large audience speaks volumes to just how important their music is to our world's culture, even in modern times.\n\nFeaturing David Crosby (a former member of The Byrds), Stephen Stills (a former member of Buffalo Springfield), and Graham Nash (a former member of British Invasion group The Hollies), CSN were (and still are) the best of the mellow rock groups. Their voices blended together in such a beautiful way, and while they have only given us eight studio albums (three with Stills' Buffalo Springfield bandmate and rock legend Neil Young), their output will outlive us all.\n\nIn 2012, CSN hit the road for a concert tour. I had the opportunity to see them live at the Tower Theatre in Philadelphia on the opening night of their tour, and I stupidly (VERY stupidly, I should add) passed that opportunity up. I regret that immensely. This live release, 'CSN 2012' is the next best thing. It made me realize just how stupid I was for not going. Hopefully they'll come back to the Delmarva-New Jersey-Pennsylvania area sometime in 2014, but that's another subject.\n\nThis album features a show recorded live in California last year. The members (Crosby, 71, Nash, 70, and Stills, 67 at the time) sound amazing for their ages. People are complaining that \"their voices have aged.\" WELL DUH! Of course they have! What did people honestly expect?!? These guys obviously aren't going to sound the same as they did in 1969 or even 1989 -- times have changed drastically, and these guys have aged drastically since then. Of course their voices are going to be a little rougher -- it happens to just about everyone as time goes on. Even with their advanced ages they still harmonize brilliantly together.\n\nI've read reviews trashing the opening song 'Carry On.' I don't get why. Stills plays a mean guitar on this version, and the band sings very well. They can't quite hit the high notes like they used to (and it has been lowered a few keys to accommodate their voices), but boy do they sound good. They are truly \"carrying on\" with grace, and this track shows it.\n\nAnother highlight is a new track written by Graham Nash and Crosby's son James Raymond. 'Almost Gone' is written about Bradley Manning's treatment while awaiting trial. For those who do not know, Manning was the soldier who was involved in the WikiLeaks scandal a few years ago. Regardless of how you feel about the situation and how you feel about the politics involved, it's still a classic CSN song in the making, featuring a strong political message. And I think I can speak on behalf of many when I say that CSN(Y) are a GREAT political band. Another great song to add to the band's vast catalogue.\n\n'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' is absolutely incredible. This may very well be the best version of the song in existence. Much of the song is just the three voices accompanied by Stills' sparse acoustic guitar. The full band joins in at the end of the song. What a powerful rendition. Stills sounds absolutely AMAZING here -- quite remarkable for a man who is almost deaf. He sings the song as well here as I've ever heard him sing it. It's a powerful track, and this version alone is worth the price of the disc.\n\n'Wasted on the Way' is always a highlight when performed live, and it certainly is a highlight of this disc as well. Crosby's new song 'Radio' is also a very good song (although I do prefer 'Almost Gone') featuring a strong vocal performance from David.\n\nThe band have also started covering Bob Dylan's 'Girl from the North Country' at their concerts, and luckily for us fans, it is included here. This is a great vocal performance (especially from Stills), and it shows just how well this group can still harmonize. There is another great version of CSN covering this track on the new Stephen Stills box set released a few months ago, 'Carry On.' That version was recorded in New York City last October, and while I probably prefer that version to the one featured here, both versions contain incredibly strong vocals. Neither are to be missed.\n\nOf course you get the Stills workhorses 'Love the One You're With' and 'For What It's Worth,' both sung here with their usual finesse and power.\n\nSo why the four stars? While I do enjoy the set (what a treat to hear 'Cathedral' live!), I wish they'd substitute some songs. As much as I like 'Southern Cross,' it'd be cool to hear a song like 'Pre-Road Downs,' 'Delta,' 'Just a Song Before I Go' or 'Daylight Again' in it's place. But again, I'm nitpicking, and obviously the group isn't going to listen to my setlist suggestions (nor should they). So, it's really a meaningless comment, but I thought I'd throw it out there anyway.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this disc. Don't listen to the naysayers; if you're a longtime CSN fan or you want a taste of what a live CSN experience is like (without shelling out all of those bucks to get 'Allies,' their long-deleted 1983 live album), 'CSN 2012' is a mighty fine choice. There's lots to like about this disc, and the band truly do sound amazing for their ages. Buy this two-CD set (as it is very cheap considering it is a double disc) and enjoy.\n\nAn aside: CSN are due to release a covers album soon. While they have been discussing this for years, I wouldn't hold my breath. They had been working with famed producer Rick Rubin on the sessions, but those recently fell through and the partnership has ended. Recently Stills denied that there would be another CSN album, but Nash refuted the statement. The million dollar question: Will there be another CSN album??? It might be awhile before we figure out, so for the time being, this offering will have to whet our appetite for some new music from these guys (despite the fact that only a handful of songs are \"new\" due to it being a live album, obviously). Stay tuned.\n\nAlso, if you get the chance, seek out the DVD as well. It compliments this album quite nicely, and it gives you a visual of what the group's shows are really like. Needless to say I won't be missing this band the next time they come to a town near me, and after seeing the DVD, I'm sure you'll be feeling the same way!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Buy this record and hear what these rock icons are up to these days, and go see them in concert if you get the chance!!!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came true, John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy's hometown grit, even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville-produced hit albums and singles. This generous compilation offers twenty tracks, and collects nearly every significant hit single that Montgomery's had in his twelve year recording career.\n\nMontgomery's first hits, the ballads \"Life's a Dance\" and \"I Love the Way You Love Me,\" had a middle-of-the-road sweetness that hit an emotional chord with both record buyers and award givers -- the second single was the ACM song-of-the-year for 1993. The love songs continued in 1994 with, \"I Swear,\" as did the awards (ACM song-of-the-year and single-of-the-year). As with most of Montgomery's ballads, the country flavor is to be found almost entirely in his vocals. There's a hint of steel, but the drums-guitars-bass-keyboard backing could just as easily host a pop vocalist (in fact, the song was covered by the R&B group All-4-One and netted a grammy). It's the slight edge in Montgomery's voice, the phrasings, and the down-home sentimentality of the lyrics that brings his slow songs into the country arena.\n\nLater in 1994 his singles began to capitalize on Montgomery's uptempo numbers, charting with the rowdy country-rocker \"Be My Baby Tonight\" and the mid-tempo \"If You've Got Love.\" Both tracks kick up the twangy guitars and fiddle of a honky-tonk bred backing. His releases continued mix ballads and up-tempo tunes, including the lightning-quick auctioneer's cadence of \"Sold (The Grundy Country Auction Incident)\" and the contemplation of his father's death, \"I Miss You a Little.\" The latter, unfortunately, is missing from this collection.\n\nBy 1996 Montgomery was mostly charting ballads, variously edging more towards the center and bringing a bigger dose of his country sound down-tempo. \"Angel in My Eyes\" is more contemporary pop than country, but 1998's \"Cover You in Kisses\" has a superb melody anchored by a strong underline of steel and fiddle. Montgomery's last #1 single, 2000's \"The Little Girl\" features Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski on harmony vocals.\n\nIn addition to seven #1s (seventeen top-5s!), this collection adds \"'Til Nothing Comes Between Us\" from the \"Pictures\" album, and a pair of newly recorded tracks: the waltz-time generation gap tale \"Cool,\" and the romantic \"One Less Day.\" This is a terrific overview and introduction to Montgomery's hitmaking career. Though it's missing the top-5 \"Cowboy Love\" and top-10 \"I Miss You a Little,\" it's probably the more complete pick over his 1997 \"Greatest Hits\" LP.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Don't get me wrong- this is not a rehash using popular albums a framework for success. The album is very modern.

{"text":"Prime Cuts: We All Fall Down, Come Back Song, She's Beautiful\n\nHootie who? Despite being the front man of Hootie and the Blowfish, Darius Rucker has made himself such a name in country music that has made his days with the Hootie a distant memory. Not since Charley Pride has another African American country artist made such a squall on the country music front. Three consecutive number ones from his debut disc \"Learn to Live\" and garnering the New Artist Award at CMA have certainly firmly established Rucker as one of the mainstays of the genre. Sophomore follow -up \"Charleston, SC 1966\" ought to continue to give Rucker the same red carpet treatment of more awards and number one hits. Like his solo debut, \"Charleston, SC 1966\" continues on the same radio ready path of pop country with that occasional touch of southern charm. And just like his predecessor, Rucker has a hand in co-penning all these cuts with some of Nashville finest scribes including Brad Paisley, Ashley Gorley, Frank Rogers, Kara DioGuardi among many others.\n\nInspired by Radney Foster's 1992 landmark \"Del Rio, TX 1959\" where Foster names his Arista debut under the name of his hometown and date of birth, \"Charleston, SC 1966\" follows suit for Rucker. While Foster's release was a masterpiece of creative ingenuity, Rucker's counterpart is less adventurous. Not that it's a ropey effort. Rather, the songs are mostly safe and radio-targeted. Best tailored towards radio is lead single \"Come Back Song\" a sensitive mid-tempo acoustically driven ditty telling the story of a mildly depressed man trying to win back his paramour after committing some foolish mishaps. While the age-appropriate \"Might Get Lucky\" tells of a frustrated middle-aged husband trying to juggle between the kids and some fun time with the Mrs.. Brad Paisley joins Rucker in penning the randy \"I Don't Care\" that bares all the marks of Paisley's patented humor over a light-hearted but catchy tune.\n\nThere are a couple of soul-searching numbers including the hymn-like ballad \"We All Fall Down.\" \"We All Fall Down\" truly showcases what a fine singer Rucker is especially in his impeccable delivery and his ability to emote the feelings of the song. \"She's Beautiful\" is another gorgeous ballad that testifies to man's contentment with his life and wife. Harkening back to his roots, \"Southern State of Mind\" is a ode to southern living (such as sweet tea and opening the door for the ladies) that ought to put a smile on anyone who has ever graced the south before. Nevertheless, the breakup song \"I Got Nothing\" and the dark bluesy \"Whiskey and You\" border on acceptable without being memorable. Although the Alan Jackson-influenced \"The Craziest Thing\" has a tad of added Cajun spice to it that ought to get our feet grooving to its infectious melody.\n\nAt the end of the day \"Charleston, SC 1966\" is a smooth, polished and enjoyable endeavor. And the songs all have a distinct southern feel to it that truly makes this as country as radio allows it. Nevertheless, the tracks are far too safe. It would have worked even better if Rucker loosen his grip on his pen a little--a few songs from other Nashville writers may elevate this from being relegated as a kiss radio effort.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"For this listener it is hello sweet baby James, glad to hear you again.  No doubt, James Taylor is much like a fine wine, not a speck of age in his sound and lyrics on Before This World.  One word that best describes this album after immediately listening to the first song Today, Today, Today, timeless.\n\nBefore This World has distinct and familiar melodies and lyrical content that fans have grown accustomed to a James Taylor album.  Indeed, comparisons will sing through each of the ten songs on the record, and a few or all of the songs tell a story much like a narrative in a Ken Burns documentary (could have easily accompanied the soundtrack to the ending credits) or David McCullough book in most of his songs that always leave a fond and unforgettable memory for listeners; one cannot deny the sound on the record is reminiscent of days long gone such as the social commentary of 1969s Fire and Rain, sentimental songs -- Carol King composition Youve Got a Friend, Something in the Way She Moves, and Shower the People.  All of the songs are worth mentioning and most likely more than will be a favorite.  But highlights on World include You and I Again, Angels from Fenway, Snowtime, the title track Before This World\/Jolly Springtime, and Wild Mountain Thyme.\n\nToo many things may be said about the album but will leave it up to the listener that would like to include the record to their playlist.  Indeed, highly recommended to diehard and new fans, and a great album to listen to any day and place, especially on the road to add a bit of peaceful atmosphere to the landscape.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60's. Much of it heavily based in fact. Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city. But there were some important hybrids too. For Frisco it was Santana. For Oakland it was Tower Of Power. A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk. Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time,they had an approch that couldn't be more different if it tried.\n\n  Right off the bat the album kicks off with \"Knock Yourself Out\". This along with the witty \"Social Lubrication\" and \"The Price\",\"Back On The Streets Again\" and \"The Skunk,The Goose And The Fly\",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick. The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.\n\n  The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer \"Sparkling In The Sand\". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going. It's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened. This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era. And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called \"united funk\".","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I like most of Ryan Adams' music, and I'm a fan of his general style.  I think Taylor Swift is talented, but her music is simply not my thing and I'm certainly not her target demographic (my 13 year old daughter and wife think she's fantastic and sing her songs constantly).  I have listened to this album of covers by Ryan Adams, and  to my ears the songs don't translate into somber rock songs sung by a 40 year old male.  In fact, they sound like something you'd hear at a local bar by a cover band making a poor choice in attempting to please their audience.  These songs were written to be performed as polished pop songs, and, while it was a bold move by Ryan Adams to cover the collection is its entirety, I can't imagine this album being considered anything more than a eyebrow-raising novelty to be listened to once and set aside.\n\nA couple of things I find interesting about this album:\n\n1) It seems like dads and middle aged guys are ecstatic that one of their favorite musicians has covered chart topping favorites familiar to their daughters and wives.  As if, \"finally we can both listen to these songs, but now in musical style I like\".  They seem to think this will legitimize Ryan Adams, and perhaps his genre, to the younger generation and top 40 listeners.\n\n2) Kids and top 40 listeners have absolutely no interest in hearing their favorite songs re-done by a 40 year old alt-country musician.  Think about when you were a kid. If you grew up in the 80's (like I did), were you clamoring to hear Cyndi Lauper songs reimagined by Eric Clapton?  Of course not, and today's kids are the same way.  To test this, put on \"Bad Blood\" as done by Ryan Adams (in a particularly embarrassing moment of this album) and see what your kids\/neighbor\/local Taylor Swift fan thinks.  I bet they don't say \"turn it up\".","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: \"When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned.\"  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like \"The Yearn\", \"Music Makes Me High\", and \"Get Up\" were sure to get any party started while cuts like \"Legal Drug Money\", \"All Right\", \"Straight From The Ghetto\", and \"1,2,3\" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like \"Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz\", \"Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless\", and \"Renee\" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on \"Legal Drug Money\", \"The Yearn\", \"All Right\", and \"1,2,3\".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like \"Da Game\" and \"Is This The Part\" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.\nStandout Tracks: 1 2 3, Legal Drug Money, Straight From Da Ghetto (My Favorite), Renee, Jeeps Lex Coups Bimaz & Benz, & Get Up","classification":4,"fold":9}

But anyway, this debut album from Canadian-born Fefe Dobson had a lot of people talking, so I decided to check it out. And I really don't see what all the talk is about.\nThe problem with this album mainly lies in the way she sings. This may be hard for some people to understand, but even if you're singing hard rock, you still have to have a good voice. The only times Fefe really delivers in this category are on \"Take Me Away\", \"Everything\" and the hidden bonus track. Most of the rest of the songs have her either singing without any effort or just talking in tune to the music (see \"Bye Bye Boyfriend\").\nAnd that song is actually one of the worst songs on the album. There are also some other poor efforts, like \"Give It Up\" and the juvenile \"Rock It Till You Drop It\" featuring Tone Loc (probably because the music sounds a little like \"Funky Col Medina\"). And \"Stupid Little Love Song\" is just that. Even her lash-out at her father, \"Unforgiven\", comes out wrong.\nI tried to give this album a chance, but I just wasn't impressed with it. Maybe it's better suited for the junior high school crowd, as another reviewer said.\nAnthony Rupert\nP.S. In response to the reviewer that compared Fefe to Hole, Hole was the name of the group, not the lead singer (the lead singer's name was Courtney Love; I thought everybody knew that).","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Rare is the musical experience where the operative reaction is to resist paying extreme attention to detail (which here means paying a cat-and-mouse game of \"was that really a sample of ____?\"), and instead make a sincere attempt to shut your brain off and just ABSORB. But that's what I believe the Avalanches intend for us to do here, as they did 16 years ago, and furthering that suggestion with some of the most downright fun music ever. Surely that's the only way we're intended to process things like the wholly misunderstood \"Frankie Sinatra\" or the extreme catchiness of \"Subways\": put our brains on sleep mode and just move.\n\nI love this album. It is overwhelming in a way the tail end of \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\" would likely have been to listeners weaned on the Monkees and Rascals and Motown in 1967, an utterly unexpected worldview, a landscape in sound that you simply can't process in one sitting. Individual tracks blur into a serial whole similar to channel-surfing or gazing out a window on a late-night drive, so long as your drive is through a place you have absolutely no knowledge about, adding the euphoric effect of wonder that can be derived just as equally from any mind-expanding experience as it is from the simplicity of a child's perspective. Is \"Colours\" a drug song or a kid's song? We don't have a standard answer, but we have our own.\n\nThere is simply no music like this out there and expecting it to retreat to the confined space of a review is sort of ludicrous. Maybe that's why the only reviews here are about the purchasing experience and not the music.\n\nWas that really a sample of The Association's intensely euphoric cotton-candy-for-the-ears \"Everything That Touches You\"?

I don't have any of their singles or EPs, and I don't have all of their albums, but I liked (and still like) a lot of the stuff I'd heard by them before I got this set. Many of those tracks are on this set, plus, the set has several other good tracks on it that I hadn't heard. (The set seems to be from Russia, or one of those Slavic countries, because most of the \"small print\" and some of the other writing on the packaging and CDs is in Cyrillic letters!) The set is very heavy on tracks from the albums X&Y and, especially, Parachutes --- it has 8 tracks from each of them, and X&Y has 13 tracks (counting the \"hidden\" one); Parachutes, only 10! (I don't remember there being any \"hidden\" stuff on Parachutes --- it's been a while since I listened to the album!) That's cool with me, though; I really like the X&Y tracks, and I think most of the Parachutes tracks are good (but not AS good). I like the songs from A Rush Of Blood To The Head and Viva La Vida that appear here, too, or most of them. There are no tracks from the live album, which is one of the two albums I don't have. There are only four tracks from the latest album, Mylo Xyloto, which is the other album that I don't have. Those four tracks aren't very much of a sample, so I'm still not sure if I want to buy the album in the very near future, but I enjoy those four tracks. (There are are just three songs from Viva La Vida, but I already had that album when I got this set.) There are also some tracks that aren't on the albums, which kind of surprised me, but those are good, too. I assume that these were originally only on singles and\/or EPs. There are some tracks here that I'm not so crazy about (though I do like most of those tracks at least somewhat), but I think that overall, this is a really good compilation.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Update: Not that I'm a fan of awards, but Dave and Jr seemed pretty happy to have won a Grammy for their title-track.  Congrats!!\n\nSkipping the first three, pre-released songs (having listened to them quite a bit), I kept Dystopia on repeat all day.  I think it is outstanding!!!\n\nI'm a life-long Megadeth fan, but I admit I pulled away after Risk for a while. So, although they are often in my current lineup, it is mostly 1985-1997 and 2011.  I think Dystopia takes old Megadeth and mixes it with the 1994-1997 era (Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings) to create a fantastically guttural thrash and well-rounded album; complete with dark lyrics and excellent compositions.\n\nYes, I'm very pleased with this release.  I don't want to get too caught up in the old vs. new vs. direction, etc., but I will say that I feel this screams and yells of the old Megadeth that I grew up loving.  Even if you aren't a long-time Megadeth fanDystopia is killer.\n\nKudos to Dave, Junior, and the Mega-newbies:  Kiko Loureiro and Chris Adler.\n\nHEADS-UP:  You (and I) get short-changed by buying here. We get 11 tracks.\n\nThe iTunes and Best Buy version adds \"Look Who's Talking\" and \"Last Dying Wish.\"  (Look Who's Talking is pretty solid). Spotify tosses in \"Melt the Ice Away,\" and the Japanese edition delivers \"Me Hate You.\"  Lastly, There is also the VR version set and other merch-bundles through the band's site.\n\nRehash thoughts of first three songs released and front-runners:\n\nRehash:\n\nI believe \"Fatal Illusion\" was the first video (audio track) tease\/release. I like it around the :58 mark when it gets past its fills (Ellefson's bass is sweet). So from there until the end, it is just killer and guttural. It got me excited to see what Megadeth (this version) would put out. Next, \"The Threat is Real\" reminds me of old school Megadeth. It doesn't have the classic step-down like Peace Sells or So Far, So Good (1986\/1988), but sounds like it could fit with Youthanasia (1994). Lastly the title track, \"Dystopia\", has an updated feel for Megadeth. This doesn't always prove to be a good thing, but I think they nailed this one.\n\nEarly front-runners: Hells bells. There isn't a song I don't like.\n\nOne that resonates with me as much as \"In My Darkest Hour\" is \"Poisonous Shadows\".  At first it sounds like Norwegian Metal. Then I thought, if Scabbia sung this (Lacuna Coil), it would totally fit their style. Yes, they are Italian, but I think you understand. And of course, if you haven't heard the updated version of \"A Tout Le Monde\" with Cristina Scabbia and Dave - check it out on YouTube.\n\n\"Post American World\" makes me feel like Im listing to Peace Sells, which is a great thing.. I also like the timing and progressions of \"Bullet To The Brain\".\n\nForeign Policy (cover) is pretty good, but would be the one song, that will get limited runs in my rotation. I'm not sure if it will grow on me or not.\n\nIn any event - solid release. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Everyone in the world has an opinion on Nirvana. It's basically split down the middle: Either you love them or you hate them. Regardless of how you feel about Nirvana, one thing is certain: Nevermind has been the subject of over-analyzation by music critics for years.\nYou've heard the story millions of times. Nevermind came out at a time when music was in a very sorry state. The 90's had just begun and the world was trying to move away from all the hair-metal bands of the nineties that had become such a stale cliche (Much like the nu-metal bands of late). Indeed, Nevermind completely changed the story of music and paved the way for countless bands of the 90's to follow and started a style that today, still refuses to die. But everyone blabbers on about how thoughtful and insightful this album is and about how Kurt Cobain was this great poet. Nothing could be shorter of the truth. The true beauty behind Nevermind is in it's simplicity. People realized that you can just have great stripped down music without all the dramatics. Don't think for a minute I am diminising the quality of this album. I'm just simply saying, everyone loves it for all the wrong reasons. The bottom line is, good music is good music. If it sounds good, it is good, nothing more to it, and Nevermind is an album that confirms that.\nI think it is obvious that this album has and will continue to stand the test of time. I myself have bought 3 copies of it since it's release (My first cassette tape of it, a CD that got worn out, and the copy I now own). Pretty much 1 out of every 5 people in the country own this. You can't throw a cat in a room full of people and not hit an owner of this album. It's effected so many people and has definetly earned it's \"Essential Recording\" label.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Its just random noise, inconsistent and unfocused. The song writing is weak and sloppy.

Patsy Cline is one of the all time greats, with the ability to express a voice that came from deep within, from her heart, from her soul.  She still lives today through the legacy of her recordings and also through her influence on so many country ladies including Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, LeeAnne Womack, k.d. lang, Mandy Barnett, and Sara Evans.\nBut don't forget the others on these performances who contributed so much.  There are the Jordonaires (who called her a female Elvis?...well, she did have the vocal group backing her who backed many of Elvis' greatest hits) on all of the cuts; Harold Bradley's electric bass also on all of these performances; Floyd Cramer's piano on \"Walkin' After Midnight\", \"Sweet Dreams\", \"Crazy\", \"So Wrong\", \"Strange\", \"She's Got You\", and \"Faded Love\"; Walter Haines' steel guitar on \"Walkin' After Midnight\", \"Crazy\", \"Strange\", \"She's Got You\", and \"You're Stronger Than Me\".  And then there are the writers of the songs that she breathed life and emotion into:  Hank Cochran's \"I Fall to Pieces\", \"She's Got You\", \"Why Can't He Be You\", and \"You're Stronger Than Me,\"; Don Gibson's \"Sweet Dreams\"; Willie Nelson's \"Crazy\"; Carl Perkins' \"So Wrong\"; Mel Tillis' \"Strange\"; Bob Wills' \"Faded Love.\"\nAll these talents together, backing a great voice of our times, have contributed one of music's greatest treasures to us, and we should be grateful to all those I mentioned and those I haven't.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Lil Wayne - Tha Carter III (Cash Money, 2008)\n\nMainstream hip-hop fans vs. underground hip-hop fans: can't we all just get along? I mean, is it cool to dig both Lil Wayne AND Little Brother? (Incidentially, Wayne did make a guest appearance on Little Brother's last album, suggesting that his appeal stretches beyond the Billboard charts.) Well, although I'm more of a fan of underground, indie hip-hop, I'll give credit to where it's due. Lil Wayne is a pretty nice rapper and he was even nice in 1998 when he was on Big Tymers' \"Millionaire Dream\". And although he hit a dry spell (namely during 2001-2003 when the Cash Money trend was dying and people were leaving the label), he reengerized and came with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter\/dp\/B00027JYPI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter<\/a>. That album wasn't all that great except for the song, \"Ain't That a B***h\", which was lyrically sharp. That set the stage for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter-II\/dp\/B000BLI4UG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter II<\/a>, which found Weezy F. Baby finding his niche. Then came all the mixtapes and guest appearances on every song, occasionally making songs by nobodies sound better (i.e., Playaz Circle's \"Duffle Bag Boy\" and Shop Boyz' \"Party Like a Rockstar\" remix). With so much critical acclaim, of course there would be so much hype for the much-delayed Carter III.\n\nThere are a couple of hot tracks on here like \"3 Peat\", the inspired \"Tie My Hands\" and the David Banner-produced \"La La\". But the best song is the innovative \"Dr. Carter\", where Wayne plays a surgeon operating on wack MC's. Swizz Beatz (with a beat that is very uncharacteristic of him) takes a David Axelrod sample (\"The Smile\") and when the music intensifies, Wayne follows suit with his rhymes. The nurse then tells him of each patient's condition. If only all of Wayne's songs were this clever.\n\nIn fact, if Wayne could spend his time making actual songs, the album would be better. A lot of times, we find him just spitting off the dome, saying nonsensical stuff and lazily getting through a song, making tracks like Kanye West's \"Let the Beat Build\" good only because of the beat itself. Other times, he makes songs that scream, \"My next single\", like the subpar \"Mrs. Officer\" and the ringtone-friendly \"Lollipop\" (which was a single). Also, the last track, \"Dontgetit\", finds Wayne talking out his you-know-what about society today and why he hates Al Sharpton. Leave that conscious rap for Talib Kweli.\n\nThere are many times last year when Lil Wayne spit a rewindable lyric and you'll have no choice but to compare the songs on this album to those moments. Has he used up his best material already? It's hard to say. But Tha Carter III is still one of the better mainstream hip-hop albums of the year. [Earlier editions of this album also came with a bonus disc of his best mixtape songs, the highlight being \"Kush\".] -EJR","classification":3,"fold":9}

I like \"Donnar, Norse\" with its almost military epic feel with the drums building and \"oh oh oh\" male vocals as counterpoint to the throbbing drumbeat.  \"Adad, Babylon\" exotically reflects the Middle East with its drums, snaking vocals and throbbing string sounds.  The concluding track, \"Indra, India,\" is a sitar-flavored meditation with the high-pitched \"Om shanti\" chorus.  I like this music very much.  Quite frankly, all the chakra information in the insert is off-putting to me, not significant nor particularly helpful to appreciate the music.  I think this is a strong disc for those of us who love inventive world music.

I hadn't been able to find many reviews on the new $18.99 vinyl.\n\nI purchased this at B&N with a coupon in-store today, but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95% of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on.\n\nI have decent mid-fi equipment, not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording. 1978 Japanese Technics SL-220 with AT95e > TC750 > Yamaha RX-V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP-S300\n\nI prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.\n\nIt may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.\n\nSo yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO. Very happy with the price\/quality. Would recommend. Kill EM All is my favorite Thrash era Metallica and this album bridges the gab between that album and puppets.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I love Bob Dylan. His music has been part of my life for over half a century and, like many people, I feel as though a lot of his songs are woven into my very bones. He is one of the very greatest of all singer\/songwriters, he has profoundly influenced the music and the consciousness of generations with his work and he has obviously earned the right to record anything he pleases. Most professional critics think this is very good. And even taking all that into account, I think this is a terrible album.\n\nBob's singing voice, bless him, has always been awful by any ordinary standards, but the way he used it and the superb songs he wrote to sing with it made it great in the context, and absolutely magnificent sometimes. I can still remember the sheer visceral thrill I felt the first time I heard Ballad Of A Thin Man, for example, and it's happened plenty of other times, but it's not a voice cut out for these crooner's standards - it really isn't. Tempest showed that Bob has still got it both as a writer and performer, but here he sounds feeble, tremulous, cracked and downright out-of-tune some of the time and that just won't do with this material. To me, this is painful and embarrassing. Even songs I like a lot, like Autumn Leaves, make me cringe inwardly here.\n\nI say all this with real sadness about one of my greatest musical heroes, but it is my honest reaction. I have forced myself to listen to this several times in case it grew on me, but it really, really didn't. Aside from Bob's singing, much of the material is uninspiring, and the arrangements are decent but so samey that they sound dull after a couple of tracks. I have given this two stars because I simply cannot bring myself to give a Bob Dylan album just one star, but I suspect I'm being over-generous.\n\nAnd now I'm off to play Tempest, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde On Blonde, Blood On The Tracks, Bringin' It All Back Home and probably several more to remind myself of the sheer genius of the man and to try to expunge this hideous mistake from my mind. May Bob forgive me, but this is bad.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"OK, artistically in many ways this is a pretty middle of the road construction. However the chutzpah takes it to the four star territory. The band kicks things off with one of their more potent statements in Lit Up, a serpentine track where the band and especially vocalist Joshua Todd channels their inner elegantly wasted Scott Weiland. In a rather inelegant way (as befits the Scott Weiland reference). The album punches along with similar blasts of punk ethos infused bluntness with tunes such as Crushed and especially Dead Again threatening to implode from their own raucous weight.\n\nThe band is on less sure footing when they try to be either profound or introspective on numbers such as Check Your Head. Restraint ill becomes them, it must be said  However the tracks that don't stridently careen towards alcohol fuelled drug-tastic destinations do at least break the album up. At 12 tracks you could make the argument that they could have pared the thing down by one, perhaps two tracks. Then again given the short running time of most of them perhaps they would have felt like being short-changed.\n\nMusically everyone does their allotted job. Were not likely to get a Bohemian Rhapsody from this crew and certainly attitude and conviction of attack is just as much a part of music of this type.\n\nProduction qualities are fine for this sort of music, pretty much everything is mixed up front and centre and Todd is given plenty of focus which is a good thing since its his selling of a lot of these numbers that comprise some of their strength.\n\nA few albums of such (mostly) head down hard rock n roll debauchery should be on every rockers shelf. There are a heck of a lot of ones that are probably better than this around but it certainly serves the purpose for all that.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Age-of-Adz\/dp\/B004132I4S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Age of Adz<\/a>&nbsp;is an album that is almost designed to be under-appreciated, and that's a shame.  This is one of the more enjoyable and thought-provoking albums I have bought this year.  There are albums to compare it to, but this is not the sort of music one would call \"accessible.\"  In many ways, those who will have the hardest time appreciating this music are the more ardent fans of Sufjan Steven's previous albums.\n\nI shudder to classify this as experimental music in the indie rock vein, because here you have a clear concept where many experimental albums are searching for one.  This is an album that requires patient listening and multiple plays, yet that alone won't be enough for people stuck on the more accessible prior Sufjan Stevens albums.  This album is neither better nor is it worse than those albums.  It is simply different, and it stands on its own very well.\n\nIMPOSSIBLE SOUL AND OUT OF PLACE TRACKS\n\nIt is tempting to critically dissect these tracks.  Some tracks, like \"I Want To Be Well,\" seem better designed to be played live.  Others are just so unconventional that they seem out of place here.  But all of them are good in their own way.\n\n\"Impossible Soul\" provides a perfect example.  It's really an EP on its own.  It brings to mind groups like Phoenix, MGMT, and Passion Pit.  This track is less of a song and more like a mash-up of 7 or 8 diverse songs.  There's even an auto-tuned section around the 11 minute mark that is indicative of its range.  It would be normal to think these various elements to be scattered, but careful repeated listens reveal its satirical beauty.\n\nThere are more *pop* elements buried within this track than on the rest of the album.  But because they are not accompanied by much lyrically, they take some work to fully appreciate.  I don't mind getting two albums for the price of one.  Unfortunately, the lyrical repetition and track length may be off-putting to some.\n\nSTART HERE\n\nThose on the fence should explore the following tracks first.  They may be more accessible, with vocals that are more forward versus the instrumentation that takes a front seat on so many other tracks.\n\nThe first track, \"Futile Devices,\" is reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkul's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bridge-Over-Troubled-Water\/dp\/B00005NKKZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bridge Over Troubled Water<\/a>.  Sparse piano and guitar accompaniment give the harmonized vocals a dream-like quality. \"Now That I'm Older\" is a track that evokes the mood of songs like Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb.\"  The beginning brings to mind angelic choral chamber music, but the instrumentation comes in waves over the early and middle portions before giving way to the vocals again.  This pulsating instrumentation is used in other songs too, like \"All For Myself.\"\n\n\"I Walked\" is perhaps my favorite track.  The moderate vocal reverb and familiar theme of romantic longing makes it easy to relate to.  The instrumentation alternates between mid-tempo rock and keyboard infused chamber music.\n\n\"Vesuvius\" is just a beautiful song.  I am reminded of the most recent album from Imogen Heap,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ellipse\/dp\/B0028Y5MY0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ellipse<\/a>.  \"Too Much\" also brings that album to mind both in the vocals and the instrumentation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is an album that may grow on you if you are patient.  It will be most readily appreciated by fans of the experimental and layered instrumentation.  It fits in nicely in the alternative and indie categories.  While it may have an uphill battle on the independent radio circuit, most music nerds and seekers of new music should find something of interest here.\n\nEnjoy.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"It's been a while since Gwen Stefani has released a proper solo album. She's done a few albums with No Doubt, has been a judge on The Voice, has gone through a divorce so one would wonder what her new album would sound like. Lucky for us, time away from the solo scene has proven useful to her. \"This Is What the Truth Feels Like\" picks up more so where \"Love, Angel, Music, Baby\" left off than it does where \"Sweet Escape\" did. It actually feels like a natural progression from her solo efforts.\n\nIt's \"mature\" popa solid album where all of the tracks play well together, unlike \"The Sweet Escape\" which felt a bit disjointed. You have a lot of songs on this album inspired by Gwen's love life. There's no sad or angry divorce track though \"Truth\" tackles what happens when life doesn't go the way you think it should. \"Asking 4 It\" is a sexy, urban tease of a track (though you won't be able to figure out what Fetty Wap is trying to rap or say). \"You're My Favorite\", \"Make Me Like You\", \"Misery\" all tackle new, flirty love. There are a lot of strong individual tracks but this is one of the few albums where all of the songs work well together as a complete work of art.\n\nFor those worried if the standard edition is lacking compared to the deluxe you can buy elsewhereI actually feel the standard edition is great and the bonus tracks don't add much to the album. They are fun tracks, a bit more old-school Gwen, but the best tracks made it onto the album, in my opinion.\n\nBest Tracks: \"You're My Favorite\", \"Red Flag\", \"Naughty\", \"Asking 4 It\"","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The good news is that 1\/2 of this album is great, songs like Wide Lovely Eyes,\nWater's Edge, Higg's Boson Blues and Push The Sky Away are classic Cave--well\nwritten moody ballads.\n  The bad news; is this really a \"Bad Seeds\" album, the electronic \"music\" becomes  redundant where are the real \"Bad Seeds\"? Also, the whole center of this\nuneven album sounds like there was a serious lack of editing of the lyrical\ncontent. Jubilee Street rambles on and as my mother used to say \"..sounds like he wrote it sitting on the toilet\". Not everything that comes to an artist's mind is\ngenius--then Mr. Cave has the testicular fortitude to write a song about creating\nthat snoozefest of a song--Finishing Jubilee Street. Where are the scathing rockers?\nI will admit that since his album Murder Ballads I have found Cave's music to be fairly uneven, his lyrics sometimes become laughable--overly melodramatic-- or sound, as on Grinderman albums, like a man having a mid-life crisis.\n  David Bowie's The Next Day, Richard Thompson's Electric, Robyn Hitchcock's\nLove From London and Otis Taylor's My World Is Gone are all great albums from start to finish, I would recommend those over this, but as I said in the beginning there are a few great songs here...just don't expect the edgy genius of the real \"Bad Seeds\".","classification":3,"fold":9}

They are best known for their Hot 100 No. 6 hits `Summer Breeze,' `Diamond Girl,' and `Get Closer.'\"\n\nThese five tracks are an excellent introduction to the magical artistry of Seals & Crofts. Their music is awesome! \"Summer Breeze\" has a terrific soft rock flavor to it; this mellow tune couldn't have been done any better and it remains a classic song. Like \"Summer Breeze,\" \"Get Closer\" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and just one listen will tell you why--this sweet tune is catchy and very well performed by Seals & Crofts. \"Hummingbird\" is easy on the ear and \"Diamond Girl,\" as mentioned above, was one of their biggest hits ever. The five tracks end with Seals & Crofts performing the poignant \"We May Never Pass This Way (Again);\" it's very impressive!\n\nThis is not only an excellent introduction to Seals & Crofts; it's also great for the rather casual fan who may not have all of these tracks already--this music is here for download!

For all it's theme of death it's not angry or hysterical but rather uses a mellow, almost folk-like vocal by Buck Dharma (who wrote the song) along with tightly harmonized backup vocals and guitar to carry it's ultimately positive message of accepting the inevitability of The Reaper. Everything is restrained until the wonderfully explosive guitar interlude about two and a half minutes in.

That was not in fact the case-she had two false starts beforehand and this was her first. At the time of this release Janet was the one member of her family not really considering a career in music. Acting seemed to be her call to \"fame\" (no pun intended) and she was doing very well in that field lending her charming,coy personality to TV shows such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Times\/dp\/B001DSNELU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Times<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Diff-rent-Strokes\/dp\/B0002JZT5U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Diff'rent Strokes<\/a>&nbsp;and later&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Fame\/dp\/B002BYYAKO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fame<\/a>. In the latter two series her appearances often including her singing in some capacity. So at this point being only 16 years old and very much \"doing what her father said\" she recorded this debut album. Even at this point her voice possesses the same coy charm as her attitude. It's definately not soul shouting of course but she has a pretty good range and,in a lot of ways has the sound of a female version of her brother Michael. The music was another matter however. With Leon Sylvers handling the production on this album (with his sister Pat contributing some keyboard parts) there is something of the flavor of both early 80's Solar R&B and some of the period Jackson family sound which,as most will remember share certain similarities anyhow. \"Say You Do\" is a great open,an extended dance-funk jam that builds from a beat to a BAAAD bassline with some great echo on it and,of course it isn't all that unlike something Michael and\/or his brothers might've come up with at that time. (\"You'll Never Find) A Love Like Mine\" has the same effect through the guys of a bubbling disco-pop tune and both tunes showcase her maturing voice very well. On these songs it would seem there was an effort to turn Janet into something of a lower key version of Stacy Lattisaw but when the funk gets percolating on \"Don't Mess Up This Good Thing\" the electronic textures of the song demand Janet belt out the song more and she does to great affect. The ballads \"Love And My Best Friend\" and her version of \"Forever Yours\" are not only just a tad over arranged but somehow don't quite seem like suitable material of the teenage singer. However the than very forceful disco freeze out the out and out four-on-the-floor disco-soul production of \"Young Love\" best explemlifies where Janet was coming from at this point and fits well with her persona at this point in time. It was on 'Diff'rent Strokes' that Janet first premired her song \"The Magic Is Working\" and this is a great and very Shalamar-like \"The Magic Is Working\" and again it fits well with who she was at the time. The album closer \"Come Give Your Love To Me\" puts her into a new-wave rock style and although the track slams again with a mean bassline leading the way Janet's voice is just not quite into rockier material at this point. Nevertheless the song itself will grow on one with the passage of time. This is not by any means her definative early album. I'd say that would be her very,very underrated second outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dream-Street\/dp\/B00000DNA8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dream Street<\/a>.

{"text":"There is honestly so much that can be said about anyone, whom can try and sing the Star Spangled Banner. It has been done so many times, and by so many people, but there have been a lot of faults that haven't been able to outshine others. Arguable, the biggest version of the Star Spangles, is definitely from the great Whitney Houston. Her legacy to deliver any cover, has been beyond what words could ever be ignited from the soul of the heart. Her rendition from the Super Bowl back in 1991, still ignites from the impassioned soul. Whenever I hear this version that \"The Voice\" honorably showcased, I am constantly reminded of how beautiful she still can shine, where so many singers like Beyonce' Knowles have not even came close to singing and delivering a simple note where Whitney ignited from first to last place. If you have never heard a song by the dynamic Whitney Houston, than this song is one I sincerely recommend.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":9}

Their early albums are killer, in the middle my interest was wavering as they seems to lose direction and two years ago they released La Grgola which was a huge come back and fantastic album. Now we have The North Corridor, and only after a few listens it appears that Chevelle may have released their finest and tightest  album to date.

{"text":"Jamie Foxx is one of the few actors to be able a successful transition from comedy & film to the music industry.  When his sophomore CD Unpredictable, was released back in 2005 it became evident that Foxx would be a force in the ever dying field of soul music.  Following up the soulful, ballad heavy Unpredictable, wouldn't be an easy task, however Foxx has provided a quality release with Intitution.\n\n1.  Just Like Me - The lead single feat. T.I. was originally written for Usher's Here I Stand project; however Jamie puts his own soulful spin on the song which could serve as a sequel to his massive hit Unpredictable.\n\n2.  I Don't Need It - I wasn't too impressed with this song as it was a bit poppish for my tastes and it seems better suited for Justin Timberlake.\n\n3.  Number 1 (Get Dumb) feat. Lil Wayne - At first listen, I found this song to be a bit annoying but it's starting to grow on me.\n\n4.  Digital Girl feat. Kanye West & The-Dream - Now this is what I'm talking about when it comes to up-tempo material. Kanye delivers an energetic freestyle while The-Dream provides a soulful hook. I can easily see myself doing the two- step to this one in the club.\n\n5.  Blame It feat. T-Pain - Even though I'm sick of the voice-coder, Jamie does a decent job with this song. He has more in common with the originator Roger Troutman, than the biter T-Pain (who needs to take a break).\n\n6.  She Got Her Own feat. Ne-Yo & Fabolous - I've been feeling this song I first heard it back in September.  The only thing new on the song it some added vocals from Jamie & Ne-Yo. However I do wish, Jamie would`ve  remixed the song with a different with an old school sample of say Switch's I Wanna Be Closer or El Debarge's Love Always.\n\n7.  Intuition Interlude - I was waiting for Jamie to slow it down, and the first hint of a ballad is an interlude, but Jamie easily more than makes up for the length of the song with his delivery of the material.\n\n8.  I Don't Know- Even though, I was hoping for a slow jam after the previous track, this is still a good song and once again Jamie delivers top notch vocals. Given the title and message in the song I was surprised; Jamie didn't sample The Pharcyde's classic's song.\n\n9.  Weekend Lover - Finally we get a slow jam from Mr. Foxx, and it was more than worth the wait. I can easily see this being a big concert song for Jamie, where he pulls a lady from the audience and serenades her.\n\n10.  Why - Another song on the poppy side, even though it's a ballad it reminded me too much of an Akon song.\n\n11.  Freak' in  Me feat. Marsha Ambrious - Jamie redeems himself with the sensual slow jam , that's a guaranteed baby maker. With this song alone, Jamie makes for any sub-par material on the CD.\n\n12.  Slow- Jamie has always said Prince was a big influence of his, and it's evident here with this slow jam. I don't know why but this song reminded me of The Beautiful Ones.\n\n13.  Rainman - Another winning ballad, where Mr. Foxx showcases his voice.  It's amazing how a singer like Foxx can sing anything and make it sound good.\n\n14.  Overdose - After seducing the ladies with some sexy slow jams, Jamie gives us a sentimental ballad, expressing his true feeling for his lady love.\n\n15.  Love Bring Change - The CD closes out with another sentimental ballad, that reminds me of a seventies Stevie Wonder. I can already see this being a piano song @ Jamie's live show.\n\nHottest Tracks\n\n1.  Freak' in Me\n\n2.  Just Like Me\n\n3.  Digital Girl\n\n4.  Over Dose\n\n5.  Rainman\n\nWeakest Tracks\n\n1.  Why\n\n2.  I Don't Need It\n\nIt could be argued that since Jamie is 41, he should be singing more songs on the adult contemporary side, I would even go as far to swap some of the ballads from Usher's Here I Stand for some of the more club orientated songs on this CD. However Jamie is his own artists and while nowhere near as good as unpredictable, there's enough material on this CD to make a great stocking stuffer","classification":3,"fold":9}
{"text":"This is in my opinion a classic song from when rock music was Great, Angry Eyes was released in 1972 a time (the mid 1960's to the mid 1970's) rock music was at its apex, a time of great experimentation and pushing the envelope.\nAngry Eyes is (again) in my opinion Loggins and Messina best song. Loggins and Messina are best know for their (bubblegum) aka pop music such as \"Your Mama can't dance\" but here with Angry Eyes they take a turn to adult music and it shows they were more than capable of doing serious music.\nI love this song it harkens back to my days as a Flower Child living in San Francisco.

{"text":"I owned all of these albums on vinyl many, many years ago (with the exception of \"The Wild and The Innocent...\").  When this box arrived and I started looking at the \"mini LP\" style packaging, it made me smile a little and say \"Oh yeah, I remember that!\"  So this box definitely had a high nostalgia value for me.  Like most of the other reviewers are saying, the sound is phenomenal, particularly on the earlier albums.\nI only deduct a star because I think it's a little bit pricey for $80.  I see a lot of people here only paid $60 (or less) and that seems far more reasonable than $80.  Also, the booklet that comes with it isn't particularly interesting.  No essays or track by track comments.  Just newspaper clippings and pictures of Bruce memoribilia throughout the years.  I've seen other box sets similar to this one with equal or even more discs (Rush, for example) that are only half the price of this box.  Adding the MP3 versions with \"AutoRip\" is a very nice touch, and I'm glad that was included.\n\nStill, it's hard to complain.  This is truly the \"essential\" Bruce Springsteen.  Not sure what they're going to include in \"Vol. 2\", but for me, after \"Tunnel of Love\", his catalogue starts to get a little spotty.","classification":4,"fold":9}

His career is one of the longer ones, by modern standards of radio-dependent commercial country music, and I've purchased a couple of his albums over the past two decades. I always liked his affection for traditional artists, those who toiled prior to about 1970, for instance. However, only about six of these 37 songs were actually familiar to me. And on this two-CD set, only about six tracks are songs I don't really need to hear more than once. The rest are very listenable, some quite powerful. To get songs this good, in such quantity, for under ten bucks is a deal no country music fan of any era should resist. Most of my listening happens while driving around my city for my job duties, and Alan Jackson and his various bands, producers and song writers are fine companions indeed.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Self Made Vol 1 was a solid album which feauterd the singles \"Tupac Back\", \"Im A Boss\", \"Play Your Part\", \"600 Benz\" & \"Pandemonium\" . The album starts off with the 8 min track \"Power Circle\" feat Kendrick Lamar where everybody holds their own, then on \"Black Magic\" which is a Meek Mill song with Ross doing his typical repetitive hook that goes \"POOF there go the car \/ POOF there go the crib POOF\/ 100 million David Copperfield !\" . The standouts on here are \"This Thing Of Ours\", Fountain Of Youth\", \"Power Circle\", \"MIA\", & \"Bury Me A G\". The production is grat on here, I gotta give Ross his credit because he knows how to pick beats. I can see the die hard MMG fans loving this album but the average rap fan is gonna think this is decent at best. Wale is featured more than anybody on here, it would been good to hear more Stalley who only shows up on four songs. Its not terrible but its not classic either, this is summertime music. Alot of these songs are gonna dominate radio and tv like \"I Be Puttin On\" and \"Actin Up\" so you cant be mad at MMG for going the commercial route.

From reading the reviews it seems everyone wanted a Steve Harris release in the vein of Iron Maiden.  if that's the case why would Steve Harris even bother releasing a solo effort???  With that said, regardless of his input or collaboration on this record, I, for one am thoroughly enjoying it.  For me, this is a straight ahead rock album and doesn't disappoint.  But, that's me and everything is subjective to every listener.  While I always say each release should be reviewed based on its own merits and not compared to previous, reviewers here are comparing this release to prior Iron Maiden releases and I find that pretty unfair.  I'm not finding the weakness in the vocalist because, at times, you could say that about a ton of vocalists out there.  Bottom line, this is a great release if you can get around your per-conceived thoughts as to what this should have sounded like.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Gotta Be Somebody, the latest single from their latest record Dark Horse, doesn't feel like it is anything spectacular or different from before, which is a dissapointment. I was honestly hoping for something different from Chad Kroger and company, but it didn't strike the chords the way that Coldplay and U2 have shown recently.

{"text":"Do you remember that old philosophical debate, about whether a million monkeys pecking random keys on typewriters for a million years would eventually produce the works of Shakespeare?  Kellee Maize's work reminds me of that, though as yet she hasn't produced much that resembles music (not lyrically, anyway).  She's apparently had the big insight that lots of words rhyme with each other or sound a lot alike, and thinks by stringing them together something profound may result.  Well, not quite.\n\nUsing big words that rhyme does not an artist nor poet make.  Gosh- consonance, continents and consequence DO sound a lot alike, wow.  You can visit any mental hospital and find dozens of such \"visionaries\", what they produce is called \"word salad\".  It's gibberish, utter nonsense.  Ms. Maize is either unbalanced or having a good laugh at our expense, possibly both.  There's nary an original thought here, no- strike that- there's not a THOUGHT here, not one that's coherent or complete, at any rate.  The words SEEM to suggest things, like a verbal Rorschach test, words randomly thrown together DO, but the meaning is imposed from without, a projection, as they say. Granted, the tunes are catchy, the beats infectious.  But if you see anything profound and revelatory in the lyrics, I suggest you Google them, and have a look some Sunday morning, in the clear light of day.  I warrant that YOU are the source of your epiphanies, the inspiration and beauty comes from within, not from Ms. Maize's ramblings, which are alternately pretentious, gratuitous, and in poor taste, to put it mildly.  In fairness though, why this strikes me as rubbish and songs like \"COME TOGETHER\" or \"I AM THE WALRUS\" by the Beatles strike me as genius, I don't know (LSD way back when may have had something to do with it, admittedly, in this case, so who knows).\n\nBTW, what is an \"aligned archetype\"?  An archetype is ONE facet of a person, one of many that complements other facets, their confluence or amalgam forms personality. I could have made some sense of \"aligned archetypes\", plural, its use in the singular is baffling- how so, aligned with what?\n\nBelow are the lyrics to Something Sacred.  I had to work around the obscenities, Amazon wouldn't accept them.  Some might think it a travesty, an insult to the things that people actually hold sacred to use the word thusly.  \"Something Sacrilegious\" might be more fitting.  Neither sacrilege nor obscenities bother me in the least, actually, but utter twaddle taken as profundity does, especially when there's so much out there that IS profound, explicitly so, like THE AVETT BROTHERS or LOVERS or HOLY GHOST! or MATTHEW DEAR, for example. I'll give you a million dollars if you can cogently explain the meaning of this song to me (well, not really, I don't have a million CENTS). But here are the lyrics, judge for yourself:\n\nSOMETHING SACRED:\n\nAlliteration for the nation, consonance for continents\nI hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this\n\nJustifiable rythym\nAsking what you been missin'\nPimps so corporate n' kissin\nValues are tied in the lynching\nAll the fat needs some pinchin\nSteady youth in a prison\nNo lovin' supervision\nThere's no cooks in the kitchen\nPoison water no fishin'\nAll the sales men are pitchin'\nTo steal cause circumcision\n[Sexual assault] us continue snitchin'\nMoney drugs over [female dogs]\nI see something real different\nI'll be holdin' a vision\nIt's not just superstition\n\nSomething sacred sewed me sideways\nI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way\nHoly hell on a hardened highway\nFeeling freaky focused\nFriday to Friday\n\nI'm fighting my ego\nI think may be it's sequel\nIs opposite of evil\nSugar f***ed up my equal\nNever researched the prequel\nToxins all in your fecal\nPoppin' pills swelling measle\nTell me where is my people\nThey don't bow at no steeple\nLightworkers gettin deepa\nQuantum physics'll teach ya\nMy lyrics they might reach ya\nRead the poems I preach ya\nThis full length is my feature\nA mysterious creature\nWe are one blood all keepers\n\nSomething sacred sewed me sideways\nI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way\nHoly hell on a hardened highway\nFeeling freaky focused\nFriday to Friday\n\nMy spaceship is leavin'\nOut the window I'm seein'\nEnd of left brain per diam\nPsychics say they can see them\nDaddy's fightin my demons\nBeside me steady dreamin\nThat he helps me make freedom\nFrom the grave he is screamin\nF! the man and his s*men\nKinda fishy no reason\nCorporation is reakin'\nSmells of workers well treated\nEarth mother she is fiendin'\nFor a break in the season\nDiscontent no one pleasin'\nCalled a [female body part] that is bleedin'\n\nSomething sacred sewed me sideways\nI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way\nHoly hell on a hardened highway\nFeeling freaky focused\nFriday to Friday\n\nAlliteration for the nation, consonance for continents\nI hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this","classification":1,"fold":9}

It's rare that I say this, but every track has it's own flavor-it's own ingredient.....and put together, it makes a great R&B Gumbo.  I thank Tyrese for keeping and still believing in \"Real, True Singing, Songs with a Message\" music. And then what makes it even better, is that my favorite artist, Brandy is featured on \"The Rest of Our Lives.\"  Would luv to see them tour together!  It would've been so dope to hear them do the infamous \"Fire & Desire\" duet.  If I have to select a \"favorite\" song, I'd choose \"Leave.\"  Something about the vocal arrangement and passion in his voice that speaks to me. I think this album could easily have been released in the 1970's-the decade of timeless classics. Can't wait to hear these songs live.

If they were alive, they would tear this song up with a most beautiful dance routine. This song is awesome because of the way the duo broke into three great sections. I am learning the bridge part. Dalton's part is easy. Macklemore's rap part is out for me. I can't even try that. But the music is mind blowing. The tapping through the song is the killer part. Love it. This is a serious dance song. I also love the instrumental orchestral part. Awesome! It has all the elements of a great club song. Or like I said, it can be a great tap dancing song for a musical.

{"text":"Huey Lewis' Sports album was very popular in the 1980s but seems to be overlooked today. But if I was asked to compile a list of my 100 favourite 1980s albums, this one would be on the list.\n\nThis is a very good re-master of Sports, with five extra bonus tracks added. The first two extra tracks are studio recordings of two tracks - The Heart of Rock & Roll and Walkin' On A Thin Line - that were on the album. These versions are good but not as good as the final versions of these tracks that were included on the original album release. The other three bonus tracks are live versions on This Is It, Heart and Soul and I Want A New Drug recorded at concerts in Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1984 and 1985 respectively. All good material but they don't differ significantly from the studio versions released on the original album. Despite that they're still worth having.\n\nOver all, a good re-issue and re-master of a classic 1980s album. The sound is good and the bonus tracks are worth having. I would recommend buying this version rather than the basic CD release containing only the material that was released on the original 1983 album.\n\nI see some of the other reviewers are criticizing the sound quality on this remaster. This one sounded fine to me.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant.  You can now listen to her latest cds without skipping over tracks that interrupt the flow.  Aside from \"What's the 411\" and \"My Life\", her albums were littered with junk that were just plain unlistenable.  Of course every mary J. Blige album has at least a couple of good songs on it, but \"Breakthru\" and \"Growing Pains\" are a complete journey you can play from start to finish.  I don't really like the title of the album though, \"Growing Pains\" reminds me too much of the old 80's tv show and it sounds too harsh like \"groin pains\".  I love the cover of the cd.  I love Mary's pose, it looks retro and Egyptian and she's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz I used to dj. You go with the shout out to vinyl, Mary. As for the songs on the cd, I love \"Work That\", I could listen to this song a million times, \"Just Fine\", \"Roses\", and \"Til The Mornin'\" are other standouts for me.  \"What Love Is\" and \"Fade Away\" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. \"Fade Away\" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding, the background music is moody and deep. Towards the end of the cd, some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots.  It's unique and groundbreaking, giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative.  The only song which doesn't do it for me is \"Grown Woman\".  It's not exactly groundbreaking material, the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point. My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on \"Roses\". \"Sometimes I need a hug!\"  Who doesn't.  Thanks for breaking it down Mary.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Instead, the songs have been a big boatload of jiggles that haven't really hit the nail on the head at all. She had a lot to prove after the smash of Born This Way and that didn't happen at all. She showed that failure with Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly on the album, and she had decided to release another version of that song with Christina Aguilera, and sadly it misses the mark as well. The two of them not only do not have enough chemistry, but fail to ignite voice and soul altogether. I think that Lady Gaga needs a real reality check for the next set of songs she releases.

With the club bangers Lil Freak, the pop orientated OMG and the slow jam There Goes impacting radio, Usher was ready to reclaim his thrown as the King Of R&B\/Pop.  With Versus, Usher displays more of the lover man swagger that was evident on Raymond Vs. Raymond, gone is the married father who sang about being a one woman man on tracks like Here I Stand & Something Special from 2008's Here I Stand. On tracks such as Hot Tottie feat Jay-Z and the album's opener Love Em' All, Usher croons about his love for all of the ladies. Unlike the recent albums from Dru Hill & R. Kelly, Usher doesn't use the voice box, instead he lets his natural do what it does best. My only complaint with the album is the reuse of There Goes My Baby from Raymond Vs. Raymond, Usher could have easily given another slow cut to go along with the excellent Lay You Down. Versus is a worthy companion piece to Raymond Vs. Raymond with a little something for every musical taste from Grown & Sexy R&B ( Lingerie) pop ( DJ'S Got Us Fallin In Love & Somebody to Love ) and southern Hip Hop ( Get In My Car feat.

{"text":"There are sometimes songs that are worth being remixed and sampled that they are better later on. But in the case with covering a song today, it can be as bigger or smaller than when the song had originally came out. Fall Out Boy has had a nice return to the industry a few years ago with Centuries and Uma Thurman. But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song, I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard. In fact, it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80's. Fall Out Boy's version of the Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago. It is not only a poor remake, but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say, \"Boy, did I waste my time on this song!\" The guys from Fall Out Boy did better covers before, like their rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It several years ago.

The CD itself proves beyond shadow of a doubt what I always have believe the internal Mortal Kombat between Darkness and Light fighting for your soul and which side will you end up on.  The band mixes rock and metal into the same album, for example the true fight of darkness within our lives in the songs Hollow and Bury Me Alive.  Yet then you have the other side of the coin with Light protecting you from the darkness in songs like Close to Heaven, The Great Divide \"As I keep you Faith Alive\", and Ashes of Eden \"Stay with me...until the Ashes of Eden fall.\"  I can also tell the mixture of vocals on the album between the heavy rock and the deep metal vocals within Bury Me Alive, Hollow, Breaking the Silence and then song Angels Fall where you can hear the pain in his voice and lyrics \"Never say Goodbye...Carry you and we will live forever.\"  This album you can hear all the emotions fighting to keep the darkness out and light in your life and the eternal saying your life is \"Darkest before it is light\" is how I believe it goes. In closing truly amazing album and look forward to collecting all their albums piece by piece for the are a force to be recken with.","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"The Soul Survivors, originally from New York City, were a white garage-rock band. The boys grew up listening to the R & B groups of the 1950s. The sounds of groups like The Moonglows, The Heartbeats, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers would have a profound influence on founding group members Charlie and Rich Ingui.\n\nIn the mid 1960's The Soul Survivors began to build a strong following, playing venues in Atlantic City and Philadelphia. Enjoying great success in Philadelphia, they attracted the attention of record producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Into the recording studio they went, emerging with \" Expressway To Your Heart \" a song that would climb to #3 on Billboard's R&B chart and #4 on the Hot 100 Singles pop chart. The success of \"Expressway\" would become Gamble and Huff's first \"crossover\" hit when it began to be played on both black and white radio stations.\n\nIn polls taken by both the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphias City Paper, \" Expressway\" was voted the number one record ever to come out of Philadelphia.

{"text":"Rakaa Iriscience, Evidence, and DJ Babu of Dilated Peoples are back with another group LP after a long eight year hiatus since the 2006 release of their 20\/20 album. In this considerable gap of time, the guys have kept busy doing various, individual side albums, collaborations, and other projects. Apparently the timeout must have inspired member appreciation of how valuable their combined chemistry really is because this 2014 Directors Of Photography album ranks equally with any one of their previous albums, which set a more ambitious standard for conscious hip hop with each consecutive release. The hallowed LA triumvirate are essentially back to their specialty, kicking tight, crafty hip hop rhymes and lyrics over elegant, soulful beats that are expertly put together, samples included. Fans can look forward to more life lessons on which to ponder and more unique attitudes, opinions, perspectives and philosophies to consider. In addition to the mental, metaphysical goodies on the album, Rakaa and Evidence also dabble in some tough-talk rapping, which means they believe in what they're saying, they are not speaking on some loose whim, and they can back up their words with strong reasoning. Every track on the album is a gem, but a few really stand out. \"Show Me The Way\" sounds like it could be a radio song. It's motivational, and it's got a great beat, a great hook, and great lyrics behind it. \"Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)\" is notable for its screwed, scratched beat, which sounds like the old East Coast-influenced West meets DJ Screw's Houston, a great hip hop cut. The gang are not without worldly awareness in \"Century Of The Self\" where they analyze the corrupt, selfish tendencies of human nature on earth. The Dilated Peoples have always been proponents of building mentally and expanding minds. They have always come original and never copied trends or tried to be something other than themselves. Directors Of Photography is all those things at once, and as a result, everyone wins.","classification":4,"fold":9}

She is going to appear live at a venue near me in 2013, so I am looking forward to getting tickets to the event.  That's how much I love her style and her sense of humor.  If you are a Southerner, you should be ashamed if you've never heard of Jeanne Robertson.  She is the epitome of a true Southern lady and her stories will be something you should relate to easily.  I think I have everything she has ever recorded and have never been disappointed.  I recommend you buy at least one track if not an entire \"show\" and hear about her and Left Brain's lives.

{"text":"On their seventh album \"Drones\" finds Muse undergoing a style change, it finds them trading in the electro-rock that characterized their last albums for a more classic hard rock sound with underlining electro beats and the results is awesome. Drones is one of (is not) their best alum to date. It's strong, consistent, and interesting especially the two interludes. The album starts off on a high note and maintains and at times surpassed it (especially with [Drill Sergeant] and Psycho. Tracks to watch out for are Dead Inside, [Drill Sergeant]\/Psycho (which are two separate tracks should have been one as [Drill Sergeant] is an interlude that leads into Psycho.), Reapers (whose intro reminds me of Power Rangers), and [JFK]\/Defector (again two separate tracks).

An exceptional celebratory song. Cheers to life! B+\n\nTWO: MAKIN' A MOVIE -> This track really flows well too. Production by Derrick White is absolutely top-notch. One of my absolute favorites. A-\n\nTHREE: KNOW YOUR NAME -> Laid-back as hell. Dreamy production by The NeXmen and Paul Dawson and has Ne-Yo stretching and giving his vocals a workout towards the end of the track. A-\n\nFOUR: TELEKINESIS -> This song has Ne-Yo sexing a ladie's body and mind. Another great, great, laid-back track. B+\n\nFIVE: CRAZY LOVE (feat. Fabolous) -> This one is good but not great. It features the often missing-in-action early 2000's rapper, Fabolous. B-\n\nSIX: ONE IN A MILLION -> An absolute breezy mid-tempo. I love the African drums. Great lyrics and marvelous flow to it. A\n\nSEVEN: GENUINE ONLY -> This is a excellent (and underrated) track to switch things up just a little. It has a lot of bass and the hand claps just fit. A love song of sorts, but it's also somewhat upbeat. My new favorite track on the album. A+\n\nEIGHT: 'CAUSE I SAID SO -> My least favorite track of them all. Doesn't quite feel like Ne-Yo but still OK. Just not the greatest. B-\n\nNINE: BEAUTIFUL MONSTER -> A dance track and Ne-Yo's lead off single. A number one hit in the UK and on the US Dance chart. Otherwise, not a favorite but growing on me. B-\n\nTEN: WHAT HAVE I DONE? -> A track of self-reflection about doing someone wrong and turning them into a monster emotionally. I have a feeling some won't appreciate this great track. I especially love the bridge. A-\n\nThis album is quite spectacular. One of the definite greats of 2010. Ne-Yo (as usual) took the time to co-write all of the tracks present and the songs fit his voice. The harmonies on many of the songs are bananas and most of the time, he seems really into what he is doing.

The videos were great but I would prefer extra tracks.\n\nAll in all, a great purchase and the tracks are quite worth it. But some just won't be able to get over the fact that no matter what edition you get, you only will have 10 tracks. However, if you can get past that, this disc\/collection of songs has VERY HIGH replay-ability and I am very, very proud to say that I purchased this album.\n\n\"A-\", 4.5 stars or a 9\/10.\n\nDOWNLOAD:\n\"Genuine Only\"\n\"One In A Million\"\n\"Makin' A Movie\"\n\"Know Your Name\" &\n\"What Have I Done\"\n\nSKIP:\nNone","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I'm one of those guys who tuned out of Megadeth during their radio days, which was basically from Countdown to Risk. I didn't really pay attention to them when they came back from their hiatus either, but the positive response to Endgame finally got me curious. Since then, I've gone back and gotten caught up on their whole back catalog, and was excited to hear their post-Endgame output. But then Thirteen came out, and I was underwhelmed. I liked half of it, but the other half seemed overly simple and a little boring. A couple years later, I couldn't even bring myself to get Super Collider. I listened to it a couple times online and really just couldn't believe what I was hearing. I thought I was through with Megadeth again.\n\nWell, now we get to 2016, and Megadeth looks much different. In are new guitarist Kiko Loureiro and none other than Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler, and out is word that Dave Mustaine is planning a thrash album. Needless to say, this is the news a guy like me was hoping would come our way. Gone are the stabs at radio rock, gone are the Disturbed guest vocals; Dystopia sees a welcome return to angry speed and thrash metal, with a  blend of classy melodic and technical guitars that are in the vein of Rust in Peace. This is not a full-on return to their past glories, but I think it's as close as we can expect at this point in the game, and a far cry better than what Metallica and even Slayer have been able to come up with in quite a while. Anthrax is the only band of the Big 4 that looks to give Megadeth any challenge for best new album of the bunch.\n\nI would venture to say that thrash fans would have been satisfied if Dystopia had been the follow-up to Rust in Peace, or even Countdown to Extinction. Its overall feel and sound is a mix of Peace Sells through Countdown, leaning mostly toward Peace Sells and Rust in Peace. Looking back, I think that Megadeth's current reputation would have been better served if this one had followed Endgame, which was a really solid thrash album. I'd put Dystopia on par with Endgame, and maybe just a little higher. Endgame wasn't devoid of attempts at mainstream hard rock and singing, especially in the choruses of 44 Minutes, Bodies, How the Story Ends, The Right to Go Insane, and the intro and ending of The Hardest Part of Letting Go. Dystopia opts for more of a metal approach, and has a darker tone than Endgame. I will say that Dave's thrash vocals are not as vicious as that album, but I don't see that improving as he ages. The bigger point for me is that, musically, this is the best Megadeth album since Endgame, it might even be a little better than Endgame, and it beats their last album, Super Collider, all to hell.\n\nMy favorite track is Fatal Illusion, followed by Bullet to the Brain, Conquer or Die!\/Lying in State, The Threat is Real, Dystopia, Foreign Policy, and Death From Within. Dave has a formidable band right now, as Adler and Loureiro make Megadeth arguably as strong as it's ever been. The drumming is full of energy, drive, and precision, keeping the album firmly grounded in metal, and Loureiro's virtuosity adds a noticeable flair that was missing with Chris Broderick. As someone who wants to see Megadeth succeed, I firmly hope Dave can keep this lineup intact for at least a few albums. I think they'd establish themselves as one of the band's best incarnations, possibly even end Megadeth's run on a high note. All I know is, Dave is playing fast, snarling, considering playing The Conjuring live again....there appear to be good times on the way for Megadeth fans. And Dystopia is a definite victory.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Made in California\" is almost intimidating in its vast attempt to encompass 50 years of musical excellence from arguably the greatest American band of all time. At 174 tracks over six discs, including alternate takes and mixes of classic hits and 60 previously unreleased tracks including demos and live recordings, even the most hardcore Beach Boys fan would be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material to sort through on this set.\n\nOnce you get past initial reservations, however, \"Made in California\" proves to be a totally worthwhile purchase even if it retreads certain elements of previous compilations (namely the 'sessions' boxed sets for \"Pet Sounds\" and \"Smile\") and offers every major hit compiled together for about the umpteen-hundredth time. It's not perfect, and even for a set this vast, some truly essential material somehow got shafted (\"Then I Kissed Her,\" Carl's amazing \"Long Promised Road\"), but the positives far outweigh the negatives in this case; the sound is excellent throughout the entire collection, bristling with state-of-the-art crispness and clarity, and some of the newly released material are amazing finds, especially Dennis's \"(Wouldn't It Be Nice to) Live Again,\" an alternate \"Brian is Back,\" a haunting cover of \"You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin',\" and the amazing compilation of live material, including an amazing \"Sail On, Sailor\" featuring Carl that may be the definitive rendition.\n\nThe packaging is absolutely gorgeous, and the booklet is terrific. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into this. Overall, this is very much an essential purchase for all Beach Boys fans regardless of some very minor gripes.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Owl City's Fireflies hits the nadir in every way that matters: the \"vocalist\" sings, in a cloyingly earnest and sincere manner, that, \"I'd get a thousand hugs\/from ten thousand lightning bugs\/as they tried to teach me how to dance.\" Yeah, it's THAT bad. I'm not even kidding. It's like some art-school dropout decided to try his hand at poetry, and, upon realizing that he didn't have the first clue where to begin, went right ahead and stole all the stupid one-liners from a box of Hallmark Cards -- and then forced them all to rhyme together. The vocals are sickeningly-sweet HORRIBLE -- imagine a forced sincerity done in self-autotune (!); the lyrics are nothing but a poorly described bad acid trip -- and the whole stupid mess is placed over \"music\" that is probably a dumbed-down version of the theme from Sesame Street, but played slightly out-of-key and slowed-down to make it even more unappealing to anybody with ears.\n\nAbsolutely rancid.","classification":1,"fold":9}

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper has been another one of the most successful female solo artists of the early 80s. Her career started to take a fall with the release of 1989 album, A Night To Remember. After the unwanted failure of A Night To Remember (1989). In 1993, Cyndi released another album that failed entitled, Hat Full Of Stars.\n  In 2003, she was able to release, The Essential Cyndi Lauper, her second greatest hits compilation since Twelve Deadly Cyns ...And Then Some (1994). I definitely call it a must-have album.\nGIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have loved this song since my years in middle school. I love it's fun-filled energy and I love it's crazed vibe. It's a classic all the way.\nMONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Another great song, but in my opinion, not among the best. I hope you know that it's true that money, in most ways, most certainly does change everything.\nWHO LET IN THE RAIN\n  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). The album Hat Full Of Stars (1993), as for I know, only had three songs I ever liked and they are That's What I Think, Hat Full Of Stars, and Who Let The Rain In. This is a moving ballad and I recommend that you all listen to it.\nSHE BOP\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I still can't get over the fact that this one talks about female masturbation. Nobody wagged their fingers at Cyndi for making a song like this, but if Madonna recorded this song, the critics and parents would have been down her throat. This is a great song. I remember watching Cyndi's Behind The Music on VH1. When they were talking about this track and all the controversey, Cyndi said that her mother called her up and said, \"Is this song about... that?\" I was laughing for days.\nTIME AFTER TIME\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have always enjoyed this song because of its moving arrangements and vocal arrangements. Everytime I see Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow dance with Alan Cumming to this song in 'Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion', I cry after laughing so hard, even though they did a great job with the choreography. I know shouldn't be laughing because they danced so great, but it's just that they chose a romantic ballad that requires slow-dancing and they decided to use ballet as their dance.\nI DROVE ALL NIGHT\n  From the album A Night To Remember (1989). This is one of the best songs I have heard from Cyndi Lauper and it came from the best album Cyndi Lauper has ever recorded, A Night To Remember. The album did not get the recognition it deserved, it is her best album by far.\nHAT FULL OF STARS\n  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). Another great song from the Hat Full Of Stars album. I knew from the moment I read the title that it would be a great song and I was right. I love it when I'm right.\nCHANGE OF HEART\n  From the album True Colors (1986). This is one of the three songs from the True Colors (1986) album that I like. The True Colors (1986) album is not a favorite album of mine, all though I love the front and back covers of that album. This song has a great vibe to it and the lyrics are well-written. Cyndi's voice was amazing on this one to begin with, but The Bangles', who provided back-ups, vocals thicken Cyndi's voice, making her voice sound like it has more enthusiasm.\nSISTERS OF AVALON\n  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). This is a good song, but it's not like her original sound. If she decided to change her sound, she shouldn't have made it sound like this. I know she has the talent to better than this.\nALL THROUGH THE NIGHT\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). This is another song with a moving sound. The vocals are incredible, the music is incredible. Who would not love this song, except for people with no brains?\nWHEN YOU WERE MINE\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Although, this is a great song, I don't like the fact that it was originally done by Prince. I literally hate Prince with a passion. In my opinion, he's a great lyricist, but he and his music can go straight to hell because I can't stand him or his music.\nTRUE COLORS\n  From the album True Colors (1986). The second of three songs I like from the True Colors (1986) album. The guitar arrangements are incredible.\nUNHOOK THE STARS\n  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). She did reinvent her sound for the Sisters Of Avalon (1997) album and not well at all. This is a song I always skip. I can't waste my time listening to a song that sounds like crap.\nTHE GOONIES 'R' GOOD ENOUGH\n  From the original motion picture & soundtrack The Goonies (1985). The Goonies has always been one of my favorite movies. The movie was filmed and released in 1985, the year that I was born. It's hard for me to believe that this movie is as old as I am and I still get a kick out of it. This song is amazing and Cyndi was the right choice to record it. The movie, original motion picture score, and this song all remind me of Wildwood, New Jersey. I don't know why, it just happened. This is one of the best songs from Cyndi Lauper and I'm happy to know that it was included in this incredible collection.\n  If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan, then you need to buy a copy of this collection. It's worth all the money you pay and you are guaranteed to be impressed.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Pitch Perfect 2\" is a film about singing, and thus the quality of the movie relies heavily on the quality of the music.  Those that loved the original \"Pitch Perfect\" will be pleased that the music for the sequel is of the same high quality and the album is just as fun to listen to (and sing along with) as the first one.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the films, essentially \"Pitch Perfect\" (as well as the sequel, based on the tracklist) follows the Barden Bellas, an a capella group, as they sing their way through competitions.  Obviously, the stories allow for many instances of singing - whether in practice or in competition.\n\n\"Pitch Perfect\" had the Bellas (and there competition, The Treblemakers) cover songs like \"Party in the USA\", \"Don't Stop the Music\", and \"I Saw the Sign\". This time around, the Bellas cover a variety of well-known songs, both old and new.  My personal favorite is the Winter Wonderland\/Here Comes Santa Claus mix with Anna Kendrick and Snoop Dog.\n\nFolks who enjoyed the first film and it's soundtrack are probably going to like this one too.  There's a new Riff Off as well as another instance of Cups.  Most of the cast returns, and there are some new additions as well (Hailee Steinfeld is the most notable new cast member).  The entire crew has great voices, and the quality of the vocals here is excellent.\n\nThere are 18 tracks totaling just under 45 minutes of music - not too bad for a movie that runs under two hours, but that still seems a bit sparse.  Perhaps there is more that will be released on a second album down the line.\n\nThis will be one of the year's best-selling soundtracks, and deservedly so.  It's a lot of fun to listen to - although if you're specifically trying to stay completely spoiler-free for the movie then you may want to steer clear of the soundtrack (and tracklist) until after you've seen it.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Uplifting is the demeanor you get to see when listening to this CD. It was a blur before but now....well. Let's just start here:\n\nWhen I first listened to this CD, I was like, OK. It's OK. But besides the single, a lot of the songs just came and went.\n\nGood thing I didn't sell this or give it away because deep inside the lyrics, the melodies and the piano arrangements, is a pleasant gift from Gavin to you. He's very, very smart and in tune with how he feels which is great to hear these days.\n\nNot that other men don't do this, because it's rampantly-common these days. But Gavin just has a way of doing it so, so, so well! So give this CD a chance! I know it took me a while to love it!\n\nI already rated the normal album with the second Stripped version and now I'm gonna do this. So you'll obviously notice that I like the songs much more now.\n\nFollow Through - 4.5 stars. I love this song. It's so innocent.\n\nChariot - 4.5 stars. We've all heard this one a million times. Inspirational and features great piano and a nice arrangement.\n\nJust Friends - 5.25 stars. What I thought about this song initially has changed. It's a great, honest tale of a lying cheat. Gavin's still willing to forgive if they just put the thought in the past and they admit that they really do love each other.\nI'm with him, but hopefully will only be stepped on once and then they're off!\n\n(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 5 stars. xoxoxox\n\nChemical Party - 4.3 stars. This is a good song. It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin. He's drunk and she is high...too high to realize him. \"I think I like you but you like this whole room. You sexy machine!\"\n\nBelief - 6 stars. This song is kind of weird, lyrically, at first. But give it time.\n\"When you came to my defense with a knife in the shape of your mouth in the form of your body\" didn't make too much sense to me then. But I've always liked the ending, continue to like it, and I totally understand what he means and is talking about now; love, trust, understanding, affection and sex. My favorite by him so far. Can't wait till the next album comes next month.\nMariah Carey is actually my favorite singer ever, and I'm looking forward to this release more so than her next!!\n\nCrush - 5 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!\n\nI Don't Want to Be - 4.75 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message. Tells the world that Gavin isn't afraid to be his own self. In fact when people expect him to be different, he totally blows it off and finds the power inside to stand out as him and no one else.\n\nMeaning - 5.5 stars. This song didn't really do much for me before...but now it's so not skip-able! In fact it's my second favorite song here. I just love the lyrics. And the falsetto notes he hits a few times. You will LOVE this one. It's a favorite.\n\nMore Than Anyone -  4.25 stars. Cute, but even though it's better than what it was the first listen through, it's just not a standout.\n\nOver-rated - 4.3 stars. I really like the lyrics here.\n\n53.35  11 = 4.85 stars.\n\nEnd note: As you saw, none of these songs gets lower than a 4-star rating this time around. I really am in love with this CD. And I must say, although I've said great things about many CDs, this is definitely in my favorite 20 CDs I've ever heard. For real, for real!\n\nBig ups to Gavin Degraw for this MASTERPIECE. It's pop music without being overly poppy. It's catchy without being too catchy and it might not be raw but it's real. Believe that.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Man,\nI don't think I've ever heard such a mechanical sounding background to an otherwise decent song and excellent vocals.  Jordin has such a beautiful voice, and she sings this song so well, it's too bad that every other aspect of this song has no human element whatsoever.\n\nThe parts that have that electronic kick drum sound firing off in rapid succession really take the cake (and drive me up a wall).  Every part of the music is so 'perfect', I mean there's not one note even slightly out of place.\n\nIn her future recordings, I hope she strays away from these types of songs, even if they happen to be the 'in' thing right now, because she has too good of a voice to waste it on any thing other than beautiful, emotional, human music.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"This album doesn't really contain interesting lyrics (although some of the songs are pretty funny), but it's still great for the dancefloor. Every track has a great hook to it which is great for the clubs, but musically it's pretty lacking. The beats are great, of course, but there's nothing new here (standard fare). It's basically just I-make-more-money-and-do-more-ladies-than-you-so-I'm-cool gangsta club rap. The reason I give this 4.5 stars is that ALL 19 songs are great club tracks (that is indeed a bargain and contributes greatly to its mass appeal)! A must-have album for clubs and parties, but it doesn't really hold any other significant longterm value. Highly recommended for clubheads.

{"text":"I'm a gonna buy the original cd on ebay any minute only cuz I can't find the non remastered version here on amazon.  If this remastered version is so terrible sounding I can't imagine how great the original cd is cuz this thing flys off the stereo.  I'm a like blastin' it too hard in my car for my rear injured speaker to handle it and I can't help myself.  Other thing is I read in the little booklet which is mostly pictures and not a lot of info but the pics are nice, that the Smart Sessions from 1990 actually have a different drummer.  I'm a big fan of Grohl's drumming, with Nirvana and particuarly on Queens of the Stone Age 'Songs for the Deaf' cd.  Incredible.  I was all smug listening to the Smart sessions goin', 'Yea, that Dave Grohl can really drum.' and then I see it's a whole different guy.  Very impressive.  There's about 4 lively songs (compared to basically acoustic ones of the 8 Smart sessions songs) that are totally worth this Deluxe Edition just by themselves.  I couldn't afford the big 'ol box of Nevermind but this does the job since the Paramount live show dvd can be purchased separately and, at this time, cheaply on amazon.  It would be nice to have Parmount live on cd.  I bought the Reading live dvd and cd and that thing cooks too.  I've been reinvigorated with Nivrana in recent weeks by getting this Deluxe edition.  It's my favorite Nirvana album by far.  Kurt appears to have known how to write a good alt rock song, as do whoever writes Offspring's songs and the lead guy for Green Day.  All three of them have a knack for getting songs to flow well.  The Weezer song writer does too but it doesn't quite hit it like Nirvana.  It's really great that in one of my favorite Weezer songs he cites Nevermind as, 'hearing the chords that set me free.'  I'm always impressed with a trio can bang out so much incredible music.  Not a lot of groups can pull it off but like White Stripes somehow often manage to sound full with just two people (and my wife goes crazy about the pedestrian drumming).  What it really means is the singing and guitar alone can really make a band go and with this drummer Nirvana was really able to create some classic alt rock songs, really, as great as any rock song period.  Smells Like Teen Spirit seems to me to be the greatest video ever and Weird Al Yankovic does one of the greatest parodies of a song every using the same janitor in his version of it.  I love hearing them play live doing that song in particular but I was impressed with Stay Away and On a Pine or whatever the next song is called.  They just exploded off the disc and had me gleefully thrashing about.  The boombox trax show what the band could have done and gone and been if that was all they could do, nice, but nothing special.  Worth hearing cuz of what the songs became.  Once they got in the studio proper they really knew how to make real music.  And not all bands can pull of high quality studio and high quality live versions of songs but, clearly, Nirvana could.  It's an incredible shame that Mr. Cobain had that stomach pain and heroin thing and appears to have decided suicide made some sense.  The lost of a musical artist that only hurts.  He left behind some masterpieces.  Working with his band mates he was able to do what's nearly a perfect album, so much so, that the fleshed out version, the deluxe edition treatment, was called for.  I'm a gonna git me the Parmount show now.  God bless you chillin'.  It's a fleeting life.  What's on the other side?  We'll all find out for sure after won't we.  I hope Kurt is in heaven enjoying awesome beauty.  He sure could make some.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"A friend's recommendation inspired me to buy this collection, and I am glad it happened. These songs take me back to the sunny 60's and the smiley-face 70's.  There are the obvious iconic hits, such as \"Aquarius\/Let the Sunshine In\" and \"Up-Up and Away\", but the great thing is the diversity to be found, while at the same time most of the tracks fit neatly into prevailing genres of that period.\n\nThe ballads about romance allow Marilyn and Florence's lovely caramel voices to sail on the seas of love and heartache:  \"One Less Bell to Answer\", \"Love's Lines, Angles & Rhymes\", \"If I Could Reach You\", \"Last Night I Didn't Get to Sleep At All\", and \"Girls' Song\".  It had been a long time since I had heard \"Girls' Song\", and when I heard the singer intone, \"I'd like to make a long distance call, to a number in West L.A.\", I was riveted, needing to hear how the story turned out.  And \"Love's Lines, Angles & Rhymes\" is an astonishing intertwining of metaphors, similes and various abstractions, used to describe Love, Want and Need.  It resembles \"Windmills of Your Mind\" in construction and sheer volume of words, and Marilyn handles it beautifully.\n\nThe band also offers harmonious soft-rock, California style, on \"Go Where You Wanna Go\", \"Workin' on a Groovy Thing\" (with Marilyn's emphatic line \"We'll take...it...slow...\"), a live version of \"Never My Love\", and of course, \"California Soul\".  Then there are 5 songs written by the incomparable Laura Nyro.  Her songs are full of life and love - love of nature, love of fellow man, love of pure expression of emotion.  Included on this collection are \"Stoned Soul Picnic\", \"Sweet Blindness\", \"Wedding Bell Blues\", \"Blowing Away\" and \"Save the Country\".  The Fifth Dimension's smooth vocals form the ideal vehicle to express the joy in Laura's tunes.\n\nSome tracks are not that memorable in themselves, but even these are of historical interest as representatives of the pop sound from the days when The Partridge Family and The Brady Bunch ruled.  I would include \"Puppet Man\", \"Carpet Man\" and \"Paper Cup\" in this group.\n\nI guess the only thing left to say is, \"Buy this CD, and have a nice day!\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

Thicke's performance is solid and varied, switching vocal registers throughout (falsetto\/lower register)  in a way he hasn't done in recent times. Additionally, his vocal ad libs and runs are thoughtful and soulful.  T.I. handles Pharrell's beat solidly, though never threatens to steal the spotlight from the 'on autopilot' Thicke.  For R&B\/urban music, this is certainly one of the more unique, standout singles as of late. Additionally, it provides excitement of what direction Thicke might tackle on his upcoming release. Highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Win Butler handles most of the lead vocals on the album.\n\nThe two part \"Half light\" (\"I need the darkness, can you please cut the lights?\" go the lyrics in part) is where things start to veer off in different directions; the first part a tender string-swathed ballad, the second \"No celebration\" a pulsing Synth-driven affair. \"Suburban war\" is a jangly tempo-shifting cinematic piece with haunting harmonies, while \"Month of May\" is frenetic Punk, a watershed of sorts.\n\nThe Beatles-esque \"Deep blue\" has a plodding gait with ethereal vocals, while \"Sprawl\" is a two part epic; the first \"Flatland\" a Morricone-style dramatic ballad with Win turning in a melodramatic croon (absolutely stunning), and the second \"Mountains beyond mountains\" an upbeat ABBA Disco-style ditty with Rgine Chassagne on vocals.\n\n\"The suburbs\" is an enthralling album, better taken as one piece with various movements, as unlike its predecessors, there aren't really any obvious standouts like \"Wake up\" (from \"Funeral\") or \"Ocean of noise\" (from \"Neon bible\").

The soft rock duo was one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. They are best known for their Hot 100 No. 6 hits `Summer Breeze,' `Diamond Girl,' and `Get Closer.'\"\n\nThese five tracks are an excellent introduction to the magical artistry of Seals & Crofts. Their music is awesome! \"Summer Breeze\" has a terrific soft rock flavor to it; this mellow tune couldn't have been done any better and it remains a classic song. Like \"Summer Breeze,\" \"Get Closer\" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and just one listen will tell you why--this sweet tune is catchy and very well performed by Seals & Crofts. \"Hummingbird\" is easy on the ear and \"Diamond Girl,\" as mentioned above, was one of their biggest hits ever. The five tracks end with Seals & Crofts performing the poignant \"We May Never Pass This Way (Again);\" it's very impressive!\n\nThis is not only an excellent introduction to Seals & Crofts; it's also great for the rather casual fan who may not have all of these tracks already--this music is here for download!

{"text":"You ever have an eccentric friend who you really enjoy being around, but sometimes you wish they would just be more normal? Well, Regina Spektor is like that for me. While I have always appreciated her quirkiness, she can come across silly, pretentious and downright annoying at times. Like Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Sophie B. Hawkins, Fiona Apple, Imogen Heap, Ida Maria, and others I know I have failed to mention, at certain times they overdo it, or miss the mark completely.\n\n\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\" isn't as great as 2009's \"Far\" or 2006's \"Begin To Hope\", so it comes as a slight disappointment. I don't know what it is exactly. I think my favorite tracks is \"All The Rowboats\" because it has so much going on and is sonically the most interesting track here. Her remodeled version of \"Don't Leave Me\" is equally as catchy and interesting. Beyond this, you have to dig deeper into the melodies and lyrics to find treasures like \"Oh Marcello\", \"Ballad Of A Politician\", \"Patron Saint\" and \"Small Town Moon\". \"Firewood\" and \"Open\" are also worthy.\n\nBut, after repeatedly listening to \"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\" it feels kind of dull as a whole. It's like that old Spektor spark is dimly lit here. Now perhaps one could argue this is a more mature work, and that's why the energy is turned down.\n\nThere are three bonus tracks that, for me, did nothing to enhance the album, and I say you are better off without them tacked onto the end. Every artist is entitled to a digression rather than progression in their career. I don't fault Spektor too much here since I am giving it four stars. I mean her quirkiness and piano playing continue to show she is a true artist. I would never argue that Spektor isn't talented, but sometimes, as I said above, you wish an artist would just drop the oddness and give you something more straightforward.\n\nHere's how \"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\" compares to Spektor's other works:\n\n2001 11:11: Three Stars\n2002 Songs: Two and a Half Stars\n2004 Soviet Kitsch: Three Stars\n2006 Being To Hope: Five Stars\n2009 Far: Five Stars\n2012 What We Saw From The Cheap Seats: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The writer of this space goes on a bit about Bach cantatas and the DNA of the Bach Guild.  For the Big Handel Box,  we devoted one line to Handel oratorios. But Handel oratorios, as Bach Guild (then grown up into Vanguard Records) entered its second decade became the more compelling artistic focus of the owner, Seymour Solomon.\nGrowing practical, Seymour Solomon soon learned that he didn't need to go to the effort of laboriously recording every Bach cantata  the expanding early music field was offering up wonderful recordings that he could simply license and release in the United States. Possibly content that his initial vision was being undertaken by others (and very mindful of the prohibitive costs involved), he turned toward the another underserved baroque vocal category  Handels oratorios. The artistic benefits were the same as the early days of the Bach Guild: there were almost no recordings of any available. The practical benefits were that Seymour never promised to record them all, and he could spend a month in London or Vienna pouring his summertime energies into crafting one marvelous recording. (For by that time, Vanguard was the largest family-owned business in America, and it wasn't because they were selling Bach cantatas, but Joan Baez recordings. So a summer vacation bathed in baroque music wasn't a bad reward.)\nSo the Bach Guild digital destiny can now present all six of the Handel oratorios recording by Vanguard between the mid 1950s and the early 1970s. One is making its digital debut anywhere Jephtha. Three were previously released on Big Handel Box (Saul, Judas Maccabeus, and Messiah).  Weve included Theodora and Semele, making this nearly 15 hour boxed set a digital feast for baroque music lovers.","classification":5,"fold":9}

This Album is not getting 5 stars because the songs are not written by him. I think that some, are even better than the originals, e.g. Garden Party, and I Don't Care. His version of Back Home Again, alone, is worth the price. Rock on Mr. Fogerty.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Where Have I Known You Before proves to me once AGAIN exactly how much different (and better) jazz from the 70's was. This is *phenomenal* instrumental playing.\n\nIt's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination. These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively, and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy.  You feel like you're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70's you will ever hear, right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond.  I seriously mean that.  Yes, I've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released, and despite the fact this album wasn't exactly popular doesn't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it.  What matters is that I've heard the album, and I'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it.\n\nThe fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist, and have been laid down on tape for this recording, really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows. This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience.\n\nThe keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album. Tastefully played, engaging, and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some. The guitar playing is the same way. More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down, that's for sure.\n\nAgain I have to ask the magic question- THIS is jazz?  The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy?  Are you sure this kind of music doesn't belong in the rock camp? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words.\n\nThe album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky. The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head. The music is certainly nothing hazy, or unorganized, or played lazily, or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time wasn't afraid to be as experimental as possible.\n\nDoes Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression? You BET it does. A positive one at that. I'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars. Replay value is important to me as well, and this album most certainly delivers in that respect.\n\nIf you're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music, check out THIS album. You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams, I guarantee it.  You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jade Warrior, Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well.","classification":5,"fold":9}

They sound really inspired after 40 plus years in the music biz.  I think it's their best work since 1985's \"Heart\", album.

Thats just some stuff I wanted to let y'all know but anyway lets into this album...I'm going to do this review a little different and just let you know the good and the bad.. I listened to the album multiple times, and I had to force myself not to turn it off. Seriously I could go on all day about how bad this album is from the horrible hooks, to the uninspired verses, to getting outshined by the guest appearances, to the limited subject matter (Swag, Haters). Kreay did not deliver on this album and seems if though she didn't even try. I would not recommend this album, just check out the songs I labeled as good. I noticed she's at her best when she makes catchy songs, but when she tries other things it fails so bad.

It was after the famous Hurricane Bob that struck New England that this became one of my fave songs of that summer. You won't find many online covers of this and I would attribute this to the fact (i.e., \"Vision of Love\" by Mariah Carey) that no one would dare to compete with the vocal acrobatics that only the original can perform.

I've seen reviews where people give a collection one star just because THAT song wasn't on there.

Sure, that was his best album, but maybe he should've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums. Oh well, there are other hits you remember, like \"Nobody\", \"Twisted\", \"I'll Give All My Love To You\", and even LSG's \"My Body\". And most hits collections contain a hard-to-find song, and here there's \"(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again\" (from the New Jack City soundtrack).\nI'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg-assisted \"Come And Get With Me\" is on here, but regardless, this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"Luc Besson quickly became a prominent auteur director in the early 90's and had some really big success with films like Lon and The Fifth Element. In recent years he's taken more of a producer\/writer role, but still helped define the action genre in his own way. He is the creative mind behind films like Taken and The Transporter. Besson has directed a few movies in the past few years such as Angel-A, The Lady and The Family. However, he hasn't really returned to the action genre as a director until now. Also, when you get a Luc Besson film you are more than likely going to have an Eric Serra score. Serra has composed almost every one of Besson's films, and his scores for Lon and The Fifth Element were an incredible display of his musical voice. Serra was also chosen to bring new life the James Bond franchise in GoldenEye. That didn't go according to plan for the producers, but his score there became an iconic modern representation of Bond that was reflected in the popular video game as well. Lucy brings Serra back to a territory where he strives in, and that's Besson directed sci-fi. Lucy may not be a perfect score, but it has enough style and flair to make it a more than entertaining experience.\n\nThe score for Lucy gains strength as it progresses along. We start as a typical sort of electronic droning suspense score, then Serra supports the action with some interesting textures. Serra's style is all over the score, and for me it was almost like a trip back to scores like GoldenEye and The Fifth Element in the best way possible. He is able to build some effective moments even if the cohesive body of the score has a hard time sticking together. There's a lacking thematic structure to whole journey. Some of the synths and sounds have a little 80's flavor to it, and it gives the score just the right amount of a sci-fi kick. In all honestly, I feel like the music could have been even more stylized. I think the weakness of the score lies in its lack of a lasting impact. I didn't feel absorbed fully until the last third or so, and if it takes that long to finally get on track then the whole experience won't be a memorable one. It's still an entertaining ride though, and it has plenty of great standout moments.\n\nLucy is not the full-form Serra we heard in scores like Lon and The Fifth Element, but it's still hearing a veteran auteur hitting some fun strides with a director he's been working with his entire career. There's nothing to hate about Lucy's stylistic score, but it doesn't offer anything to take with you beyond listening to it in the moment. There are some great melodic points that will pull you in, but not enough of them. This is a score that needed some more stylization to make it stand out, but it's still a fine Eric Serra score as it stands.\n\nKaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.com","classification":3,"fold":9}
{"text":"First let me say I am a big fan, so this might be a little biased. This cd is musically is all over the place----and I like it. It's not an easy listen after her last two cd's which were great. It covers blues, country, rockabilly, and (believe it or not) psychedelic. If you are a first time Lucinda listener, start with Lucinda Williams and  Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. Then switch over to A World Without Tears and Where the Spirit Meets the Bone. Lastly, Blessed and Ghosts on the Highway. It is different, but very good. If your a fan, it might take a few listens before it takes hold. Enjoy.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Actually, no... Ke$ha doesn't blow.\n\nAt all.\n\nFollowing-up \"We R Who We R,\" Ke$ha re-releases \"Blow\" (the title here was the original lead-off single for Cannibal, but \"peaked\" at #97 on Billboard's Hot 100 before vanishing into thin air). Blow feels exactly correct here as the follow-up single behind R; the video (already done) is in-place across cable TV-land (and has been for some time), while re-mixes & ringtones have long been available (from the prior earlier release) -- it just seems correct to not let all of that in-place effort go to waste before breaking \"Sleazy\" (or whatever the next single might be from Cannibal) across radio.\n\nBlow strikes me as a bit less than a finished product; the track feels demo-like with a cut & paste chorus, although the production & vibe certainly feel acceptable as-is. The single is a bit darker in tone, lyrically; Ke$ha speak-sings that she (and her pals, apparently) are, ...taking control\/pretty and sick\/young and bored... we get what we want\/we do what you don't. It's noteworthy that after 5 Top 10 singles in a year, Ke$ha's voice still sounds new and refreshing.\n\nVocally, Ke$ha here stays in safe-range; the in-chorus hook strikes me as actual yodeling (!); I can't recall actual yodeling being used in a mass-market single, ever. This, alone, gives the record a certain stamp of uniqueness, although it does wear thin after a few listens. Getting back to my earlier point about the track feeling demo-like (Ke$ha seems to PREFER tacky, cheap, and cringe-worthy effects, and uses them ON PURPOSE; some of Ke$ha's effects sound as if they might have come straight out of a 1980's video game); I do think this could have re-mixed into much more of a lasting ear-worm. I suspect that Ke$ha simply had the stuttering ooo-ooo-oooh on file from some earlier piece, and simply built Blow around it after realizing that she had a wonderful stand-alone hook (kind of like Hollywood building major films around some new special effect) -- which doesn't mean that such efforts don't work, of course: indeed, they absolutely DO. It's just that songs like this don't get \"written,\" in the usual sense: they are ASSEMBLED, and Blow, unfortunately, has exactly that sort of sound, which it didn't need to have. This could have been done as a blast of originality; a freight train of onrushing goofiness. Instead, well... it was left to Blow.\n\nStill, the grasp of songwriting as craft here is on full display, and I have no doubt that Ke$ha lands another Top 10 SKU here with an extremely radio (and club) friendly unit. It's another solid (but safe) effort, worthy of 3 stars, although just barely -- and that's not meant as \"real\" crit, by the way: I do understand that as a new artist, Ke$ha is still grinding, still \"attacking the belt.\" By the time we get to her 2nd or 3rd album, however -- when she gets to the point where she can do whatever she really wants no matter who likes it or doesn't like it -- I have a feeling that Blow-like tracks will be much more goofily sophisticated & experimental-sounding... Ke$ha is hinting at her future sound here, and it's very cool. Tracks like Blow feel almost designed to make you feel young or old.\n\nMan... I wish that Ke$ha had never put that stupid Dollar $ign in her monniker.\n\nIt seemingly announces, in advance, that she's a cultural irritant not to be taken seriously -- while the reality is that Ke$ha is one of the brightest bulbs in the box. It takes an absolute TON of intelligence to make pop this sharp, smart, and plain ol' damn good to sound so vapid, shallow, and dumb.\n\n3 stars.\n\nKe$ha: more, please.","classification":3,"fold":9}

Rihanna struck a cord within my soul when I first heard this superb song because of the bright mood vibe music and the musical stories that the writer in me envisions from just this one song. I understand that a completely different music video could arise from what I imagine the song to be about, especially because of my awareness that this song could actually hold a completely different meaning depending on who hears this song. The writer in me for some reason sees This Is What You Came For by Calvin Harris feat. Rihanna being about a man or woman who is the center of attention either in social, professional, and\/or romantic settings by several people but the person who is the center of attention actually has an interest in someone else that does not pay the same amount of attention to them as the others do for whatever reason.

{"text":"Carly Simon and I are road buddies.  I've driven about 20,000 miles this year.  Her CDs are ones I frequently pull out as the miles click away.  Her voice has spent so much time in my car and her tunes keep reaching my top ten rotation that I decided this set was one I had to get.  While I initially thought it might be a bit of a rehash and wasn't all that jazzed as I was about hearing Carly sing \"Scarborough Fair,\" I've got to admit that on first spin I kept comparing Carly's voice and arrangements to the earlier recordings.  Second spin I started to tune into the nuances of the arrangements and her vocals.  By now, I'm really enjoying the entire set.  First of all, the songs are great.  The title track totally knocks me out with that sound of well-worn wisdom.  \"The silent understanding passing down from daughter to daughter, let the boys grow in the trees,\" Carly sings on an arrangement that has grown on me completely.  \"You're So Vain\" shines with this slow swaying acoustic arrangement and that classic melody, \"You said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave; but you gave away the things you loved & one of them was me.\"  The new song \"No Freedom\" swirls like an emotional storm.  \"That's the Way I Always Heard It Should Be,\" \"Anticipation\" & \"Coming Around Again\" are all great in these new sonic clothes.  \"Never Been Gone\" bears the sound of having lived in song and is glorious for the added depth.

{"text":"With The Beatles' first five albums, we have them in the process of boy-girl \"I love you\" pop, whereas their only artistic contemporary Dylan is doing much more satisfying (to this listener) work during this time period. Of course, these five records, and especially HARD DAY'S NIGHT, are the best that early rock'n'roll has to offer. And this is the same period HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED is released. Tell me, do you want to listen to Like a Rolling Stone or Desolation Row or this pop with Ringo singing a Buck Owens song about \"all you have to do is act naturally\"? I think that's the worst Ringo song of all. They should have stuck with the song from Anthology II \"If You Got Trouble\", and maybe included \"That Means a Lot\" as well..\n\nNot that this is a bad album, by any means. Its The Beatles, after all, and all of their albums (even BEATLES FOR SALE) is top rate stuff. This is the first album to point toward some new changes in The Beatles' repertoire. The best songs on here are the title cut, Ticket to Ride, Its Only Love (in my opinion), Tell Me What You See, and the best Dylan song that Dylan never wrote: Hey You Got To Hide Your Love Away. Oh yeah, I'm also leaving out another song.......what was it.......something about Yesterday. Of course, I'm sure no one remembers that, but I think its pretty good, very memorable melody. Its not like its the most covered Beatles song ever *cough cough*. Also, a funny factoid for you music buffs is Yesterday was originally Scrambled Eggs, and McCartney literally dreamt it. One thing Lennon resented McCartney for happened that this and Michelle, two of The Beatles' biggest song, is essentially McCartney solo, with Lennon not playing at all on eithet track.\n\nDizzy Ms. Lizzy's good for the rocking side of Lennon, reminiscent of Twist and Shout off Please Please Me, which, btw, was never released in America in the original format until much later (ooooh, that evil Capitol!).\n\nSo chalk it up as a holding pattern, one last boy-girl lyrical record before they moved on to the much more satisfying (to me) mid and late portion of their career. Remember, any criticism against The Beatles is realative -- it should go without saying any other band would give their front teeth for these songs.\n\nYesterday, all my troubles seem so far away........","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I like steampunk. I like Weird West. I like comic book adaptations. I like movies that bust out of the usual genre cliches.\n\nBut it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for \"Jonah Hex\" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of \"Wild Wild West\" and \"Van Helsing,\" with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.\n\nJonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.\n\nThen the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building \"the weapon\" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).\n\nI wish I could give a better summary of the plot in \"Jonah Hex,\" but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.\n\nBasically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden (\"Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead\"), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for \"the weapon,\" it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?\n\nI'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.\n\n\"Jonah Hex\" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" Give it a pass.","classification":1,"fold":9}

{"text":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Classical-Music-for-the-Reader-Great-Masterpieces-for-the-Dedicated-Reader\/dp\/B005TVT9XO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Classical Music for the Reader: Great Masterpieces for the Dedicated Reader<\/a>&nbsp;is OK, and if it helps expose more people to classical music then that is a good thing.  But you can get many better collections here on Amazon for a better value.  It left me disappointed.\n\nIn general, classical music is a great accompaniment for reading.  I use it to soften the mood at home and at work, where I read and write for most of my day.  What one ideally wants to avoid are surprising loud crescendos and fast energetic works that can sometimes distract you from what you are reading or working on.  Unfortunately, too many tracks chosen for this collection fit that category.\n\nSome of the most recognizable pieces from classical music are compiled here.  Schubert's Ave Maria is presented here nicely.  Brahms' Waltz #15 (Opus 39) will sound familiar even to those who don't listen to classical music.  And of course you have the oft-overworked pieces from Debussy's \"Clair De Lune\" and Pachebel's \"Canon In D.\"  Handel's \"Largo\" and \"Serenade\" are both also very recognizable and pleasing to the ear.  But so many tracks fit into those categories that this devolves into a \"greatest hit\" collection instead of a carefully crafted compilation.\n\nThey did make some nice surprising choices here.  The prelude from Wagner's Lohengrin is perfect for such a collection.  Massenet's \"Thais Meditation\" blends in nicely, as does Debussy's \"Nuages.\"  And Albioni's Adagio in G Minor is another choice I enjoyed, where the dramatic moments are nuanced instead of jarring.\n\nBy the time you get to Strauss Jr.'s \"Wine, Women & Song\" with cymbals crashing, it becomes clear that this compilation was not made with reading in mind.  That fact is punctuated by the Adagio from Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Lizst's Liebestraume #3 is perhaps a little more energetic than I would ideally like in such a compilation.  And \"L'Arlesienne Intermezzo from Suite Number 2\" by Bizet is at times lovely and at other times ominous to my ear.  But Schubert's \"Trout\" quintet's frenetic piano solos make it distracting despite starting out soft and soothing.  Even much loved works, like the \"Spring\" movement from Vivaldi's Four Seasons and the \"Morning\" movement from Peer Gynt, are full of too many dramatic moments to make them ideal for such a collection.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf you want an affordable collection of classical music, this is an acceptable choice.  But you will get a much better value with an alternative like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rise-of-the-Masters-100-Supreme-Classical-Masterpieces\/dp\/B005VZRBR4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rise of the Masters: 100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces<\/a>. Even picking one of the composer specific collections, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bach-100-Supreme-Classical-Masterpieces-Rise-of-the-Masters\/dp\/B005WW94ZS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bach - 100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces: Rise of the Masters<\/a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Brahms-100-Supreme-Classical-Masterpieces-Rise-of-the-Masters\/dp\/B005W26TVK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Brahms - 100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces: Rise of the Masters<\/a>&nbsp;is probably acceptable.  In my opinion, this compilation has too many dramatic and distracting moments to be ideal for reading.  If you don't mind reading to the boisterous symphonic movements included here, you certainly won't mind anything in any of those collections.  And they provide much more musical value.  This is still worth getting, but I highly recommend you don't get it for the purpose of reading.\n\nEnjoy.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"50 Cent has surprisingly went from \"Most Hated\" to \"Most Anticipated\" to \"Most Celebrated\". You may remember him from 1999's single, \"How to Rob an Industry N\", where he jokingly talked about robbing many famous artists like Mariah Carey (who was on his label, Columbia) while ribbing them at the same time. Not many artists found that funny, the song turned into a gimmick and soon he was dropped from Columbia (maybe it wasn't a good idea to sing about robbing your labelmates???). During his downtime, he made many foes, including Jay-Z (in 1999's \"It's Hot\", Jigga rapped, \"I'm about the dollar\/WTF is 50 Cent?\"), and I think that he's even been shot more times than 2Pac. But after Eminem picked 50 up and signed him to his Shady Records label, and 50 dropping \"Wanksta\" and a few underground albums with his crew, the \"GGGgggg-uuuUnit!\", the streets embraced him and anticipation was at an all-time high.\nGet Rich or Die Tryin' is one of those debut albums that actually lives up to its hype. In fact, if you're in your car playing it to the end, you may just feel like playing the whole album again. While the lyrical content may not break any new ground, 50 Cent, whose flow sounds like a mixture of Jay-Z, 2Pac, and Mase, knows how to deliver it WELL. See \"Gotta Make it to Heaven\" (an otherwise played-out subject matter with gangsta rappers), where he gives the topic an interesting twist, and \"In the Club\", where he takes topics like cars, drinks, and women and make them sound original. Fans may say that song sounds radio-friendly, but he didn't go to mainstream, mainstream went to him.\nThe production on here is also stellar; not one track sounds similar to another, a problem on most rap albums today. Check out the dark beat on \"Patiently Waiting\" with Eminem and \"21 Questions\" and notice the difference in production. And what would a rap album be without a diss record? (See \"Wanksta\" and the funnier \"Back Down\", both aimed at Ja Rule.)\nEven though \"P.I.M.P.\" is embarrasingly old-school and lazy on 50's part, Get Rich... is one of those rarities in hip-hop: a highly anticipated album that truly delivers, by a rapper who disregarded gimmicks to let people know why Slim Shady signed him.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The magnificent Dead Or Alive kicks off this 1981 album by Cale, and this song alone is worth the price of the album. Its paints a frightening scenario of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet lines of John Gatshell. Fighter Pilot is another frenzied track with lovely background vocals by the Bomberettes while Cale's viola rules on Wilson Joliet. The title track is a strange atonal affair with French lyrics, and is followed by the desolate ballad Riverbank that fades out on the most beautiful instrumentation. Honi Soit is an uneven album and not amongst Cale's best.

{"text":"I don't write long reviews, so straight to the point.  This is FANTASTIC TRAIN MUSIC.  This is the best complete Train album since My Private Nation.  Every song on this album really has something to say and begs to be listened to over and over.  The first 3 train albums were awesome and then they kind of dropped off a bit.  Good comeback with Save Me, San Francisco but even that album has some filler on it.  Bulletproof Picasso is SOLID from start to finish and there is a song on here that probably won't be a hit, but I can't get it out of my head and it is different from any Train song ever.  The song I am speaking of is called \"THE BRIDGE\".  Awesome song as is the rest of the album, the bridge is just different to me.  Give that song a listen and let me know what you think.  Thanks for your time.  TRAIN IS REALLY \"BACK ON TRACK\".","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the tragic death of Natalie Cole. Musically, she was one of the most soulful R&B songstresses in the world. Yet, in the way Natalie was remembered at the end, was actually by so many people remembering Natalie from the problems she had endeavored back in the 70's and early 80's, from bankruptcy and addiction. Sadly, that is disgusting to her legacy, and the everlasting memory of her beloved father, Nat King Cole. There are so many songs she had soulfully graced our hearts with for 40 years of pop music. Natalie Cole will always be remembered so many great songs, but her debut hit, Everlasting Love, will always be the one people will go to for the first glimpse. The song is just a joyous and soulful rhythm that still shows beauty and soul from the heart. today, the song has been the signature opus, for eHarmony. It is one my favorite songs that Natalie Cole will forever be remembered for, and a real treat for anyone who has never even heard a glimpse of her unforgettable voice.\n\nNatalie Cole: 1050-2015\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Alanis' 3rd studio album proves that she knows what she's doing.  An outstanding lyricist and a wonderful performer.  From start to finish, this album is something Alanis should be proud of.\n01.  21 Things I Want In A Lover - the opening track is one of the more rock songs.  It's a favourite of mine, Alanis describes things she would like in a lover 'are you funny?' etc.  5\/5\n02.  Narcissus - at first I didn't like the song because the vocals are a bit scured but after a couple of listens I really got into this song.  The lyrics are something females can relate to.  5\/5\n03.  Hands Clean - the first single off Under Rug Swept, a nice song sounding more like the stuff from SFIJ, good.  4.5\/5\n04.  Flinch - another song we can relate to.  I find this song really close to my heart, an excellent way of describing a relationship lost but still in your heart.  5\/5\n05.  So Unsexy - different lyrics, brilliant.  I love the way she describes herself in this song, 'I'm 13 again, am I 13 for good?' and so on.  5\/5\n06.  Precious Illusions - I love this song, the vocals are sexy and raw.  LOVE IT.  5\/5\n07.  That Particular Time - the worst song on the album, Alanis' vocals aren't up to her regular pitch and the music lags on and makes the song seem kind of boring.  2\/5\n08.  A Man - the music is hard again here, the lyrics are a little different (a woman saying she is a man) but it makes perfect sense.  Wonderful.  5\/5\n09.  You Owe Me Nothing In Return - another one of my favourites, a song about love and how your partner need not give you anything even if you give them everything.  5\/5\n10.  Surrendering - this song seems to disappear from memory but it's amazing.  I'm not sure why this isn't a stand out.  4\/5\n11.  Utopia - vocally and lyrically this is brilliant.  I love this song, a perfect closing.  5\/5","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"Remasters of old albums has been going on for a long time, and justifiably so.  For example, I own a CD of Rainbow's \"Difficult To Cure\" that sounds like it was mastered with speakers from a pocket size transistor radio.  So it's interesting to see Exodus do a total remake of their classic debut \"Bonded by Blood\".\n  Re-named \"Let There Be Blood\", it's a really good addition to the Exodus catalogue.  While the original deservedly will always be in the thrash hall of fame, seeing those chestnuts dusted off and remade with the current line-up breathes new life into them.\n  Not to belittle Gary Holt's memories of the late Paul Baloff, the original vocalist, the fact remains that current screamer Rob Dukes is a far better vocalist, even as he very kindly adds some nice notes in deference to Baloff.\n  The tunes are downtuned, and the tempos are sped up or slowed down here and there.  Some of the soloes are new, too, which is only fair to Holt's partner Lee Altus, who replaced the original Rick Hunolt two albums ago.  What makes this worthy is Duke's much sharper delivery, because let's face it - Baloff may have had the attitude, but I have always maintained that he sounded more like a hoarse dog barking than anything else and made listening to \"Bonded By Blood\" a bit trying at times.  Sorry to slag a fellow, but that's my take.\n  It's a successful CD and sounds much better, and I would like to see some other thrash classics either remastered or redone, such as Metallica's \"And Justice For All\", Anthrax' \"Among The Living\" and VoiVod's \"Killing Technology\" and \"Dimension:  Hatross\".  How about it?","classification":4,"fold":9}

I had only heard a single song by St. Vincent previously, but her voice intrigued me, all the more reason to get excited about this pairing. And yet, after nearly 20 listens, I'm still waiting to be impressed by these songs, but with the exception of \"The One Who Broke Your Heart\" (a fun song that features the Dap Kings) it isn't happening. You can call this music quirky or even challenging, but it falls far short of greatness. Interesting arrangements (I like the use of horns) and if you enjoy the vocals by either singer, that's a plus too. But I find the songs lacking in memorablility overall. They chug and sputter and don't really go anywhere. I think these two tried hard and strived for good performances, but the mediocre quality of these compositions prevented the album from taking flight.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"This fabulous collection is a lot like Saint Saens himself. It makes the most beautiful music of the very highest standard available to the masses, without the slightest hint of being dumbed-down. Saint Saens' reputation has suffered because of that attitude, and it is only now, at the dawn of the 21st century as classical music has been threatened by total marginalization, that the arbiters have finally given him his due and as the leading French composer of the romantic era. This collection makes that clear.\n\nI can see parallels with other composers. Just as Saint Saens has been criticized for not sounding French enough, Samuel Barber has finally overcome the rap of not sounding American enough, while Shostakovich, ironically long criticized for being too Russian, finally seems to be supplanting erstwhile Russian Stravinsky as the greatest 20th century composer of any nationality.

It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far, but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums.\n\nEarth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco-dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance-pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET'S GROOVE. But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out-of-the-world chorus. CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style. FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan. KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days' music style.\n\nVerdict: Well-balanced and great one-CD compilation showcasing their career.\nRating: 90 out of 100\nRecommended for: Music fans who want to get a glimpse of great 70s music.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era, considering that it's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim, starting with 1998's \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\". The current decade has found Williams to be very productive, with 2001's \"Essence\" and 2003's \"World Without Tears\" studio albums and one live album. Now comes the new studio album.\n\nOn \"West\" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother (\"Mama You Sweet\" and \"Fancy Funeral\"). The opener \"Are You Alright\" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include \"Unsuffer Me\", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny \"Come On\"; the epic 9+ Min. \"Wrap My Head Around That\"; the sweet \"Words\"; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of \"Where Is My Love\" and \"Rescue\". Nice, but not really essential.\n\nIn all, I have come to like this album more with every listen. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams, nor her best (that would still be \"Car Wheels\"), but this is a rich album in every sense. But it's not for anyone in a hurry. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her \"World Without Tears\" tour, and was blown away by her stage presence. I can't wait to see how the songs from \"West\" will translate in a live session.","classification":4,"fold":9}

It really is a nice and strong statement, especially from acts like Lady Gaga and Rihanna who've made really awful songs this year, that haven't been worth their weight in the dough.

{"text":"Musically, \"Dead Again\" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.\n\nThere are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational\/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (\"I'm a drug addict, always will be\", \"there's no excuse for drug abuse\", \"A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide\") or pun-filled attempts at humor (\"Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four\").  The song \"Ode to Locksmiths\" actually has the line \"Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped\".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as \"September Sun\" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, \"She Burned Me Down\" and \"Halloween in Heaven\".\n\nOther than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque \"These Three Things\" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (\"Black No. 1\") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Profits of Doom\", \"These Three Things\", \"Ode to Locksmiths\" and the haunting closer \"All Hail and Farewell to Britain\" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend \"Dead Again\" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The best thing about Stripped is how musically varied it is. There's hip hop, some salsa, rock, gospel, and a few inspiring ballads. Something for everybody.\n\nThe Alicia Keys produced Impossible is a bluesy piano-led ballad about a man who refuses to open up to Christina about his feelings for her. Frustrated by the lack of communication, she warns \"This is not a circus\/Don't you play me for a clown!\" and wonders \"How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down?\"\n\nChristina's voice is flexible and stronger than ever here. Despite having a cold at the time, she managed to showcase the \"pimped out vocals\" Alicia swore she'd get out of her. Impossible would've been a great choice for the final single over The Voice Within, but the uncredited use of a few lines from the Aretha Franklin classic Ain't No Way most likely played a part in why RCA nixed the idea. A video featuring Christina in a dimly lit jazz club pouring out her soul to her man would've been great, but alas.\n\nIf you choose to download only one song from Stripped (although you should check them all out), the jazzy Impossible is an excellent candidate.

{"text":"Having finished with Blood, Sweat & Tears and their debut album \"Child Is Father To The Man\" in 1968  AL KOOPER found himself the in-house Producer at Columbia Records in need of a project. So he calls up ex Electric Flag and Paul Butterfield Blues band ace guitarist MIKE BLOOMFIELD and together they determine to make a 'quickie'  a Blues and Soul jam album they'll pump out in one manic session. They get down enough material for one whole side of an LP (a couple of covers and some originals) - but Kooper needs the remainder. With Bloomfield flown the coup (chasing things other than the blues)  Kooper called in ex Buffalo Springfield guitar\/songwriting whizz Stephen Stills to record the rest. And out of these most unlikely of 'sessions'  history was born. Columbia CS 9701 (Stereo) peaked on the LP chart at an impressive 12 and started a run of superstar jam sessions - all trying to capture the same lighting in a bottle (common consensus agrees that few got near it).\n\nAl Kooper's liner notes explain that he's gone back with Engineer ALLAN TUCKER to the original master tapes and 24-bit remastered the album to CD. And in keeping with fan-requests over the decades  he's taken off the 'horn' overdubs put on the long jam sessions so devotees of this iconic and cool 60ts album can finally hear Bloomfield workouts like \"Albert's Shuffle\" and \"Season Of The Witch\" 'sans horns' (see bonus tracks 10 and 11). They are magnificent and arguably up there with the best Bonus Tracks ever issued. All in all - you have to say that given what they had to work with  Kooper and Tucker have done a bang-up job. Here is the 'Man's Temptation'...\n\nUS\/UK released April 2003  \"Super Session\" by BLOOMFIELD, KOOPER & STILLS on Columbia\/Legacy COL 508071 2 (Barcode 5099750807125) is an Expanded Edition CD with four Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows (77:14 minutes):\n\n1. Albert's Shuffle\n2. Stop\n3. Man's Temptation\n4. His Holy Modal Majesty\n5. Really\n6. It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry [Side 2]\n7. Season Of The Witch\n8. You Don't Love Me\n9. Harvey's Tune\nTracks 1 to 9 are the album \"Super Session\"  released August 1968 in the USA on Columbia CS 9701 (Stereo) and September 1968 in the UK on CBS Records S 63396.\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n10. Albert's Shuffle (2002 Remix Without Horns)\n11. Season Of The Witch (2002 Remix without Horns)\n12. Blues For Nothing (Outtake from the Session  first made available on the 1995 Mastersound CD of \"Super Session\" on Columbia CK 64611)\n13. Fat Grey Cloud (Live)  Previously Unreleased (Recorded 1968 at The Fillmore West, San Francisco, CA)\n\nMIKE BLOOMFIELD  Guitar on Tracks 1-5, 10, 12 and 13\nAL KOOPER  Vocals, Ondioline Organ, Piano, Electric and Acoustic Guitars\nSTEPHEN STILLS  Guitar on Tracks 6 -9 and 11\n\nGUESTS:\nBARRY GOLDBERG  Piano on Tracks 1 and 2\nHARVEY BROOKS  Bass\n\"Fast\" EDDIE HOH - Drums\n\nThe 12-page booklet has an opening 'Producers Note' from All Kooper not just explaining the recordings but the CD reissue and his 'without horns' 2002 remixes. BRUCE DICKINSON was Executive Producer for the re-release and both the Michael Thomas original LP liner notes and the David Fricke Rolling Stone Review are reproduced (four-stars from Robert who spends much of his time raving about Bloomfield when Kooper's contribution was just as big if not more in my books). There are some black and white session photos and not much else. ALLAN TUCKER did the Mastering at Foothill Digital Studios in New York and the Audio is fantastic  full of power and presence and that sense of immediacy the recordings had anyway (the Bonus Cuts are beautifully transferred too).\n\nIt opens with a Bloomfield\/Kooper Instrumental called \"Albert's Shuffle\"  nearly nine-minutes of Shuggie Otis type Blues with Bloomfield shouting as he solos  Kooper letting loose on the keys (an organ sound most would kill to get). Next up is the uber-cool \"Stop\"  an instrumental cover of a Howard Tate soul tune on Verve Records from December 1967 (Verve VK 10573). Ive loved this slinky little ditty for decades now and it still has that 60ts chug about it that utterly sends me. Next up is the first vocal by Al Kooper on their version of Curtis Mayfield's \"Man's Temptation\"  a song about a temptress who wants to \"...ruin my happy home with man's temptation... But then we get the magnificent band really cooking on another Bloomfield\/Kooper creation \"His Holy Modal Majesty\"  a 9:19 minute Organ\/Guitar battle that feels like Santana gone Prog by way of the Blues (and I still don't know what the title means). Side 1 ends on the Traditional Slow Blues vibe of \"Really\"  5:26 minutes of Bloomfield letting rip on the frets while Kooper puts in huge chords on the Organ (very tasty mama).\n\nSide 2 has always been problematic for me. It opens with A Stephen Stills take on Dylan's \"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\" and to me it immediately sounds like the album has gone off the rails. The tune is OK  but thematically it comes over like poor mans Monkees instead of the fresh Bluesy workouts we were getting on Side 1. Things are brought back from the brink big time by the stunning 11:08 minutes of \"Season Of the Witch\" (a Donovan cover they did on the Side 1 all-day session). Columbia and CBS edited both it and \"Albert's Shuffle\" down to fit on the A&B-sides of a 45 in October 1968 (CBS 3770 in the UK, Columbia 44657 in the USA)  but it did little business despite the success of the album (it's a no-show here due to time constraints). Back to weird with the Hendrix flange cover of a Willie Cobbs tune called \"You Don't Love Me\" which again is good  but still feels wildly out of kilter with the rest of the record. Then we enter mellow Jazz Soul territory with the saxophone-led \"Harvey's Tune\"  another out of step instrumental that sounds like it should be in a Blaxploitation film instead of on this album. But then you're hit with four corkers...\n\nWhile the album has its incongruous moments  the bonus tracks act as an impossibly brilliant counterpoint  the first three sounding like the powerhouse Blues Session that should have been released. Why \"Blues For Nothing\" was left off the album and mediocrity like \"Harvey's Tune\" left on is a total mystery (4:15 minutes) and the two album cuts minus-the-horns actually seem to free the songs and focus you completely on the dynamic duo  Al Kooper on Organ and Mike Bloomfield on Guitar. \"Season Of The Witch\" is the prize here and stretches to its full 11:08 minutes - stripped and raw - it has a renewed power that's thrilling. As if this is not satisfying enough  the live Instrumental Blues of \"Fat Grey Cloud\" is fantastic  Bloomfield joking first about 'tuning' then letting rip  wild one second  Soulful Bluesy the next  with Kooper following after - pumping out an Organ Sound that is huge (4:39 minutes).\n\nIn truth the original album is probably more four-stars than five - but this genius CD reissue with those stunning bonus tracks bumps it up again.\n\n\"...You've got to pick up every stitch...\"  Kooper sings in their funky cover of Donovan's Sixties-sinister \"Season Of The Witch\". And it seems that anything from that incredible 'super session' was indeed worth picking up...","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Ok, on first listen, I was less than enthused... the songs seemed unimaginative and formulaic and the vocals just seemed... like a redo of many things on Psycho Circus and COS... I was never all that impressed with Live To Win, the song.  I really didn't like Lift much better.... though I have since come to realize that I just don't care as much for the chorus (which backs down in energy rather than go forward) and the verse is fine.  Before I go on saying generally negative things... this CD has been STUCK in my player repeating since I got it...  and I do find with each listen I find more and more I like and I find I don't dislike things I originally disliked as much.  So for me to claim I dislike the album would be very inaccurate.  For one, this album is of course going to be compared to the '78 solo and that isn't exactly fair and you have to acknowledge how that comparison is going to hurt the ability to truly deeply LOVE this album in the same way.  We are talking nearly 30 years ago to affect the sound and style and one has 30 years of greatness dug into my heart.  Live to Win, to me, doesnt have the truly GREAT songs that you found on the 78 solo... or, more precisely, not enough of them.  Similarly, I didn't think anything was weak on the '78 solo and on Live To Win, I the song Second to None pretty much sucks (I hate the chorus lyrics) and is sort of a rehash of other things already on the album.  Get rid of that and add another in the vein of Bulletproof and it would have gone a long way to making this a better album.  Hell, 5 more solid songs would help as it is a bit short for an artist that you just know is more productive than this.  The other thing, I really think Paul SHOULDNT write with so many other people as I swear they do more to sterilize his work than help it... it just adds to the nature of being formula driven.  There are a few times where you feel \"ok, here is the part in the song where there would be a bridge prior to the solo section...\" and sure enough, there is one... and it seems more forced to be there than it feels to be a real natural progression for the song.  I cant recall the example song for this, but I know there are at least 2 songs that illustrate this and you should find it obvious when you listen to them.  Anyway... as I said, its an album that I think will at first come across to many as good, but not as good as it should be... but, then if you stick with it, it actually grows on you rather than away from you... so that is a good thing.  Had I rated it right after I first got it, I would have given it a B-... now, its a solid B moving towards B+ (probably Second to None keeping it from hitting the B+... I really hate that chorus).  I originally disliked Wake Up Screaming and its \"911\" lyrics... which I thought were pretty weak (there is alot of cheese in the lyrics album wide, but Paul can usually pull of cheesy lyrics rather well)... but the more I spin it the more that song just sticks well without the lyrics ruining it.  Bulletproof is the gem of the album... with Where Angels Dare being a very close second, for me.  I also really like Loving You Without You Now... it just sounds nice and in this case I actually enjoy the lyrics and think they are pretty neatly crafted.  Listening to this album, I actually think alot of the songs are similar in style and production to the Paul Psycho Circus songs which I guess helps me feel a little better about the Psycho Circus songs (an album that has generally been tainted in my mind to the point where I never listen to it... because it feels like a KISS album that KISS didn't play much on and only sang on).  Some of that holds true with this album... just like with Gene's you really wonder with all the names and credits... just HOW MUCH did Paul actually do?  In Gene's case, I suspect he did as little as he had to... and likely didn't play much of the bass even.  With Paul, I do believe he did the guitar... but the songs aren't all that full of guitar and so many others are creditted on guitar, so it does make you wonder.  Still, I hear alot of traditional KISS Paulismns in the rhythm to help me feel at ease here.  This is probably why I like Where Angels Dare so much... there are some very familiar sounds from the past layered in that song.  So, my mind tends to think Paul plays quite a bit of the guitar but uses the guest players to really fill it in and provide some modern touches in lead and lead noodling that goes on.\n\nBy the way, this is not nearly as weak as a Bon Jovi album, though it does have that overerly formulaic (at times) feel to it that would be a fair comparison.... especially in the more ballady songs.  Bon Jovi has been virtually nothing but Puss-Rock from after Slippery When Wet and on.  Paul doesnt deserve negative comparison to Bon Jovi... and comparing him to them actually is like giving BJ some kudos.\n\nI still think this album is a must for KISS fans... and really isn't a waste of money for anyone (that would be Gene's solo album).  If all you have heard is Lift or Live to Win and felt only \"ho hum\" about them, rest assured, there are still better songs awaiting on the album.  Another thing about this CD, is at first, I think most of the songs will seem very similar to each other... but as it sinks in with repetition, the differences shine through more and that contributes to it being a \"grower\" album.\n\nI am totally looking forward to seeing Paul live on this tour... it should be great.  I hear he is playing Live to Win, Lift, Everytime I see You Around, and Bulletproof on the tour... I understand Live to Win and I think Bulletproof is a great song... but the other two are among my least favorite on the album... I wish he'd change that up.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"It's great to have such a substantial selection of Grieg's delightful music for solo piano available at such a low price. On the other hand, I have somewhat mixed feelings about Mourao as a pianist. She isn't as widely known to pianophiles as such VoxBox stalwarts as Abbey Simon, Walter Klein, Peter Frankl, and Guiomar Novaes, let alone the young Alfred Brendel--and there may be a reason for that. I don't much like her in the \"Lyric Pieces\". What strikes me first is a lack of subtlety and finesse in the handling of dynamics. She seems to me to have just two levels of volume: loud and soft. There's not much in her playing by way of a  pianissimo or fortissimo and very little gradation between piano and forte--it's either one or the other. The same it true when it comes to rubato and to a cantabile (or singing) style--which is essentially in these very \"Lyric\" pieces. Nor is there much differentiation in the characterization of each of these pieces, although each is meant to project a distinctive mood: Spring Dance, Cradle Song, Butterfly, Summer Evening, etc.\nI have performed extensive comparisons between Mourao's performances and famous Grieg solo piano discs by Emil Gilels and Arthur Rubinstein. Admittedly, these masters offer tough competition, but these great pianists are not just better--no surprise there!--they are functioning on an entirely different plane from Mourao's (IMHO) rather clunky pianism.\nNow for a change in view--a change that is based on further listening and caused me to revise my rating upward to 4 stars. I'm much more attracted to Mourao's playing in the Norweigan Folk Songs and Dances, and in \"From Holberg's Time.\" I'm not sure why this is. I think she's actually playing better in these works (more dynamic range, more variety in the pacing, more characterization of individual pieces). However, it may be that, because I don't already have these pieces in my collection, I'm not comparing her to the lofty standards of Gilels and Rubinstein. Anyway, this VoxBox is worth buying for the Folk Songs & Dances, etc, alone.\nIf you're shopping for a low priced and well played Grieg selection, you might also want to consider the Grieg: Rise of the Masters set, which is currently selling for $2.19 and which offers a substantial selection of Grieg's music in all genres.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I knew that Jamie Foxx had released a CD in the past entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Peep-This\/dp\/B000008N0A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Peep This<\/a>&nbsp;but it was hard for me to take a singing career from a comedian seriously.  The last time around, Eddie Murphy wanted to sing about his girl wanting to \"Party All The Time\" with Rick James.  The song ended up being a comedy instead of something that anyone in their right mind would take seriously.  However, when I heard the title track to Jamie's 1st CD on J Records entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Unpredictable\/dp\/B000BPK2MK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Unpredictable<\/a>, I finally had to take notice.  The track was a midtempo jam featuring Ludacris that was being played on the radio and in the clubs constantly.  Once the CD was released, I was surprised that I liked the majority of the CD.  It was obvious that the \"Three Letter Word\" was the theme of the CD, but I took the CD for what it was and it was in heavy rotation along with Mary J. Blige's \"The Breakthrough\" and Anthony Hamilton's \"Ain't Nobody Worryin'\" for awhile.  My favorite songs included \"With You\" w\/Snoop Dogg & The Game, \"Can I Take You Home\", \"Wish You Were Here\", and \"Extravaganza\" w\/Kanye West.\n\nEventhough, I liked \"Unpredictable\", I was still reluctant to purchase \"Inuition\".  Jamie definitely impressed me on Ne-Yo's remix to \"Miss Independent\", \"She Got Her Own\", which also featured Fabolous.  However, I wasn't impressed too much with the 1st single, \"Just Like Me\".  The track sounded entirely too much like \"Touch My Body\" from Mariah Carey, which was another track that I wasn't a big fan of.  What eventually changed my mind was when I heard the party banger \"Blame It\" featuring T-Pain.  Don't get me wrong, I have never been a T-Pain fan.  However, he definitely represents on the hooks.  This time around, he isn't even featured on the hook but his verse as he pays homage to The Dream takes this track to another level.  Once I heard \"Blame It\", I knew that I would add this CD to my collection.  \"I Don't Need It\" is a catchy tune that is produced by Timbaland and sounds as if it could have been a song that was left off of Justin Timbalake's \"Future Sex\/Love Sounds\" CD.  This track will definitely have you dancing and Jamie's lyrics will have you laughing at the same time.  \"Number One\" is basically Just Blaze's r&b version of TI & Rihanna's \"Live Your Life\", which Just Blaze also produced.  I have heard better songs and the usage of The Beastie Boys' song \"The New Style\" should be against the law, but if you are in a club, this track will definitely get the party started or keep it going.  I have heard better Lil Wayne verses but you're so busy dancing or doing a 2 step while the track is on, you forget that this is an elementary Lil Wayne verse.  Jamie, Kanye & The Dream will keep you dancing and partying on \"Digital Girl\".  The song is very catchy and Kanye gives you 2 verses in the song, which is another uptempo club jam.  Salaam Remmi, who has several production credits to his name, including work with Wyclef Jean, Nas & Amy Winehouse, stops by to produce my favorite song on this CD as of this moment \"I Don't Know\".  If you are a man of any age you will be able to relate to the scenario in this track as a young lady has caught his eye and he isn't able to attract any attention from her at all.  He has to think of What If? type scenarios if there ever was a chance for him and this beautiful woman to be together.  Jamie goes back to the \"Three Letter Word\" on tracks such as \"Weekend Lover\", \"Freakin' Me\" w\/Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry, \"Slow\", \"Rainman\" and \"Overdose\".  The best of those being, in my opinion, \"Weekend Lover\" and \"Slow\".  Jamie tones things down on the midtempo \"Why\" as he reminisces about a lost love and on \"Love Brings Change\" as he talks about how the average man\/woman can be affected by a new love.\n\nOverall, if you take \"Intuition\" for what it is for face value, I think that the majority of Jamie Foxx fans and current r&b listeners will like this CD.  If you are an old school r&b purist, like I can be at times, then this may not be the CD for you.  You may want to preview some tracks first before you decide to add this to your music collection.\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Blame It w\/T-Pain\n2) I Don't Know\n3) She Got Her Own w\/Ne-Yo & Fabolous\n4) Why\n5) Weekend Lover\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nSlow\nIntuition (Interlude)\nDigital Girl w\/Kanye West & The Dream\nOverdose\nLove Brings Change\nFreak'in Me w\/Marsha Ambrosius","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"2.5 stars\n\nWarrant is back with their seventh studio album, their second to feature the original lineup, sans singer Jani Lane. The band's new singer is Robert Mason, replacing Black N' Blue singer Jamie St. James, who sang on 2006's \"Born Again.\"\n\nWarrant is a guilty pleasure of mine. The band might have written some cheesy songs that sounded dated very shortly after their release, as they fell into obscurity in the 90s, but they had a gifted songwriter in original singer Jani Lane. Songs like \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Down Boys,\" as corn-ball as they might be, were a cut above most of the butt-rock sludge that was being churned out in the late 80s and early 90s. His songs sometimes even had a touch of melancholy, which gave Warrant a genuine sense humanity, something that bands like Winger or Slaughter lacked.\n\nIt was Jani Lane that made Warrant an above-average band in the first place, so without his presence, how do Warrant sound? This question was first answered with \"Born Again,\" which wasn't bad. It sounded more like Black N' Blue than Warrant, but it was a good record. It's a shame that that lineup didn't continue. \"Rockaholic,\" while not bad, isn't as good. The band and the production sound good, but the songs are sort of just by-the-numbers 80s rockers and ballads. Mason is a competent singer, but nothing special. The lyrics, which are nothing but cliches about getting laid and heart-break, don't help much.\n\nWarrant are smart enough to know that they aren't going to sell more records by trying to sound relevant, so they wisely stick to making an album that old-school Warrant fans might dig. The problem is that there isn't anything all that memorable. Still, if you like 80s pop-metal, \"Rockaholic\" might be worth checking out.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album \"0304\" was released.  But the photos that adorn the CD's layout -- oh my!  She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact.  She is the living definition of \"young and smart and sexy,\" to use the catchphrase she coined for this album.\n\nOK, so I've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel's looks, but the question is, does she have the music to back it up?  The answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\"\n\nSome reviewers considered \"0304\" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer\/songwriter, but I believe this to be one of her best albums.  The opener \"Stand\" is a classic.  It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD.  One of her best ever.  It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel's knack for making odd references in her lyrics (see also the one to Charlie Sheen in \"Intuition\") that put a smile on the listener's face and make for memorable songs.  Beyond that, I love \"Leave the Lights On,\" a slower and more laid back track.  One thing that was new to Jewel's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor-made for any dance hall, something some fans of her past, more folkish tunes didn't take well to.  I for one love it.  Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to.  I mean, you just can't get more catchy than songs like \"Yes U Can,\" \"U & Me = Love,\" and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country, \"America.\"  Excellent stuff.\n\nThere is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD, as only Jewel can, all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve.  The only reason I'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow-up \"Goodbye Alice in Wonderland\" even slightly better.  Still, if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are, Jewel will show you how on \"0304.\"  Highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This album sounds very different than most TOP albums, so if you're used to that stickier East Bay Grease they'd develop once hitting the big WB you may have to listen with a different mindset.\nThe sound on this album *IMHO* is a big \"blacker\" a bit more late '60s\/early '70s feeling, and definitely shows their ties to COLD BLOOD, another band DEFINITELY worth checking out.  In many ways tight, but not as tight as they'd come to be, yet they compensate with soul splattering ENERGY.  - - The closest you've probably heard TOP to this \"sound\" is on their BUMP CITY album, when they went back to a dirtier and grittier sound.\nFUNKATEERS will love this album.  TOP fans (and their following of brass ensemble students turned on by hip instructors) will be split between Love It\/Hate It... however, *IMHO* its one of their best and they still perform many of the songs in their show today.","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.\n\nWhile her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.\n\nOverall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.","classification":2,"fold":9}

Legend sounds the best over the reggae tracks and the acoustic tracks. Good guest appearances also with Andre 3000, Estelle, and Brandy.

{"text":"\"Winds of Samsara\" is a glorious collaboration by keyboardist\/composer Ricky Kej, flutist Wouter Kellerman and a crew of about 120 musicians from five continents. With musical instruments and stylings from all over the world, this is clearly a world music album. Several of the tracks have a very strong Indian influence, reflecting Kejs cultural background, but there is also a gorgeous arrangement of Greensleeves, a track by Australias wonderful Fiona Joy, and a Nocturne by Chopin. Impossibly diverse? In less capable hands, perhaps, but this album works seamlessly and beautifully from the first note to the last. With themes of peace and global harmony as well as musical tributes to Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Ghandi, \"Winds of Samsara\" is a richly rewarding experience from an emotional and spiritual as well as a musical perspective. I predict that this one will shoot up the charts very quickly!\n\n\"Winds of Samsara\" begins with Mahatma, a piece with diverse musical elements that come together as one to symbolize the late visionarys message of world peace, non-violence and love. Guests artists on this track include guitarist Ciro Hurtado and vocalist Prakash Sontakke, but it is Kellermans flute that makes it soar. New Earth Calling scales back the production a bit, but not the beauty or effectiveness of the music. Crystal Moon is the first piece Kellerman ever composed. Haunting and graceful, it features Kellerman on flute and fife, accompanied by guitars, keyboards, and percussion. Madiba is the family name of Nelson Mandela, and this piece expresses the feelings of gratitude the two composers have for the great leader. Both powerful and very gentle, its a favorite. Heaven Is Here is a new arrangement of Pieces of Heaven from Kejs 2013 release, \"Shanti Orchestra.\" It is also the first piece Kej and Kellerman worked on together. With ethereal vocals and the universal spirit of love, its a deeply emotional stand-out. River of Time remembers a lost loved one and was composed by Phresh Makhene and Kellerman in a distinctive African style. Remembrance is set to the old English folk song, Greensleeves. Inspired by the universal and timeless quality the song, it is sung here by Indian and African voices. Journey to Higher Grounds is another favorite. An ode to positivity, progress, and resilience, Kellermans flute goes heavenward as strings, piano, and keyboards give it wings. Grace brings in one of my favorite artists, Fiona Joy, with her original composition and playing her new Stuart and Sons grand piano. Backed by Kellermans flute, Kejs keyboards and bass, santoor and vocals, the song elegantly  enchants as it touches the heart. Nocturne was a real surprise! (This is Chopins C# minor Nocturne, not the better-known Nocturne in Eb.) I don't generally like my classics messed with much, but this arrangement is stellar with Michael Lewin on piano, Kellerman on flute, an Indian choir, and the Seattle Pro Musica choir. What a stunning ending for an incredible album!\n\n\"Winds of Samsara\" is amazing and certain to be on many Favorites lists for the year! Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

Overall, when it came down to the hype around her surprise album in 2013, she really made a lot more songs that have been cheap at her heart, and showed that she didn't have any growth from the soul. She has really made a lot of songs that really weren't as strong as what she had done earlier. Everyone was so overdone with Drunk In Love, that most of the other songs found from her self-titled album didn't get enough recognition or airplay. XO was one of those songs that really was more of a lackluster ballad that didn't show a strike that was stronger. In fact, the song was definitely weak overall. I really didn't like the song, and I felt that her prior ballads like Halo and her rendition of the great Etta James ballad At Last were much better. I suggest you find another Beyonce' Knowles track to own.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"It is not a mystery why this disc was as successful as it became.  Nine years after its initial release, the songs sound as fresh and enticing as they did when I first listened to it.  The program is full of pulsating dance numbers: \"Believe,\" \"Strong Enough,\" \"All Or Nothing.\"  Cher reworks one of her moderate hits from the late 1980s, \"We All Sleep Alone,\" into a beat-driven disco song.  And \"Dov'e L'Amore\" is a song reminiscent of her Snuff Garrett days, appropriately modernized.\n\nCher's continuing ability to realign herself in center stage after a period of relative dormancy proved undiminished when \"Believe\" hit the airwaves.  More importantly, it made people more aware of Cher's musical standing: She outlasted 99% of her contemporaries from the early '60s and her ability to entertain only grew as time passed.  More than ever, we need to be reminded that its okay to have fun and there's no better person to remind us of that than Cher.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"There is so much that could be said about Gwen Stefani. Musically, she has used her voice to strike back against her marriage to Gavin Rosedale abruptly ending in divorce. While she had drove well with her music, it is a far cry from her success when she used to be a part of No Doubt back in the 90's and early 2000's. Now, she is really on her own with a new relationship with singer Blake Shelton, and starting her life all over again. But with some tracks that I had heard from This Is What The Truth Feels Like, I wasn't completely impressed with the songs that she had already came out with the album. Misery, the third single from her album, isn't actually a strong and poppy song that really drove in the way that she had from her earlier solo songs like The Sweet Escape and Rich Girl. It is a alright song, but not anything that really drive into a bigger sound for Gwen. Hopefully, there are better songs from her down the road that are worth the while. Something will put us with her misery into a more upbeat song.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Currently on tour with Styx, Yes has been playing their hits on the road for most of the past decade, but one thing they haven't done in the last ten years is release a new studio album. However, the band's new record, \"Fly From Here,\" did not come without cost.\n\nIn 2008, Jon Anderson, the lead singer and songwriter for Yes, developed respiratory problems and was unable to tour with the band. His replacement was Benoit David, formerly of a Yes cover band. Journey, another Classic Rock era band, found their vocal replacement in a similar fashion.\n\nEventually, Trevor Horn, who produced for Yes in the late '70s and early '80s, was booked to make a new record with the band and Jon Anderson was never told. Obviously, this created a rift in the band that will likely never be healed, but Yes is back and \"Fly From Here\" is their best album since 1983's \"90125;\" Horn's last project with the band.\n\n\"Fly From Here\" opens with an epic 25 minute long title track split into five parts. Where albums like 1994's \"Talk\" and 1987's \"Union\" seemed to lose focus, \"Fly From Here\" is an absolute nod to their biggest triumphs while still taking some time for reinvention. Trevor Horn's days as a member of The Buggles, the group that brought \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" to the world, come through the mix at times, likely aided by keyboardist Geoff Downes, who has played with both The Buggles and Yes in the past.\n\nAs a progressive rock band, Yes' music is often filled with intricate instrumental sections and syncopated rhythms which rarely make mainstream radio, but fans of Yes' classic records should absolutely give \"Fly From Here\" a listen straight through. David's vocals offer a fitting tribute to Anderson, but stray enough from Anderson's soaring vocals at times to mark the beginning of a new era.\n\nAlthough Yes substitutes performers in and out all the time, their membership for \"Fly From Here\" found the magic that many thought was lost long ago.\n\nSimilar Artists: Rush, Styx\nTrack Suggestion: \"Fly From Here\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those artists that has been so severely overplayed, and overexposed like a robot that is too much, that she has just been not worth listening to anymore. The only talent she had was when she was a part of Destiny's Child. But on her own, she has oversaturated the market where it has been too much about her, and no one else. When she was starting to get out on her own, she had one or two songs, but that was it. Her collaborations with her husband though, not even exciting. Her song Deja Vu from her 2005 album B' Day, has not been impressive, trying to recapture the chemistry she one had with him on Crazy In Love, and sadly she does not impress at all. I really did not enjoy the song, and sadly it is not worth listening to, especially when it has been overplayed so many times. If you are really new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back and listen to when she did have talent as a part of Destiny's Child.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":9}

Him marry Kim Kardashian has really made some very bad bedfellows and his songs just haven't been as strong as other rappers. Only One, his collaboration with Paul McCartney doesn't actually hit the strong nail on the head. It actually feels more mixed than actually anything that really has came from the heart. I personally found the song to be less of his professional game than anything that really proved to be strong for everyone.

{"text":"The sound of this hit is much more upbeat than the deep, solemn, and slower \"Lord I Need You\" but it still deep and solemn.  Do \"all the people say amen\"?  Well, perhaps not.  I'm sure Maher knows this.  Perhaps it's a historical slice of the witnesses in a bible story or a Revelation glimpse when we will all behold the wonder of the Lamb.  It's a song of fun, encouraging, and beautiful faith and sound.  Whether for a retreat, diverse prayer method, to put your worries and sins into greater light, or simply to join in your car or house with your \"amen,\" Maher's latest hit longs to draw you closer to the love of God and a foretaste of Heaven.  \"We are all the same, in need of mercy--to be forgiven and free\/It's all you got to lean on, but thank God it's all you need.\"  How awesome!  Both in lyrics and an image of God and the beloved believer.  I love the references to rich and poor, weak and strong, and scripture . . . \"We're all broken but we're in this together\" . . . and I think God knows very well that the Spirit works in amazing and diverse ways through singers, songwriters, and musicians to help heal us and bring us hope and harmony in songs like this one.  A little mustard seed?  Yes, perhaps it is.  It ain't no Beethoven symphony, and it may never be a Hollywood record setter across every town and nation.

{"text":"If you're not familiar with Mudcrutch, and listen to the first track, you'll say something like \"Wow that guy sounds like Tom Petty\". There is a really good reason for that. It IS Tom Petty. Mudcrutch was the band Petty was in before he made it big as a solo artist. While the people interested in listening to this album probably know the back story, I've venture to say most other people have never heard Mudcrutch. Petty and 2 others from Mudcrutch would eventually form The Heartbreakers. Hence the very similar sound to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers overall. They reunited for a Mudcrutch album around 2007,with a small tour that was more for the band to enjoy being on the road again than for real album promotion.\n\nOverall the album is good. It hits a lull about 75% of the way through but it recovers nicely at the end. It's great background music to just fill the room and immerse yourself in Tom Petty style goodness. The lyrics overall aren't spectacular. Petty's voice is. The band behind him is fantastic. Petty does share the vocal responsibilities with Tom Leadon and Benmont Trench. But it's mostly Petty behind the mic.\n\n Trailor - As soon as the music starts, it feels familiar. It's a softer version of that classic Tom Petty sound. The harmonica is there. Petty's bluesy voice is there. It has got what you're looking for.\n\n Dreams Of Flying - There are lyrics. But this feels more like a jam session. The band keeps going for a good while after the lyrics end. It's ear candy and I like it. But I like it for the music on this track, not the vocals.\n\n Beautiful Blue - This one was not for me. It just didn't resonate with me. But to each their own.\n\n Beautiful World - Petty is not the lead vocalist here. The entire band sounds different without him. It's a good sound and it adds some diversity to the overall sound of the album. I like the way the band sounds here.\n\n I Forgive It All - This is a beautiful song. It's Petty's voice in front of a guitar for the most part. It's slow and simple and amazing.\n\n The Other Side Of The Mountain - The pace picks back up here. Petty shares the vocals and it does not work. The entire vocal track does not mesh well with the music. The song is definitely peppy. It's got a country bluegrass jam session vibe to it. I am pretty sure I hear a banjo in there. No one's perfect.\n\n Hope - This one has a 60's sound to it with the distorted electric guitars. This track is not working for me at all either.\n\n Welcome To Hell - LOVE IT!!! This one gets everything right. I like the lyrics. I like the music. I like the theme. This is a fun song about being miserable because your partner is gone. It's not easy to make that theme into a fun song. They nailed it. It's good songwriting. It's good singing. It's good music. It's a great song.\n\n Save Your Water - Another all around great song where everything is working. The lyrics, the vocals, and the band are all firing together perfectly. This is a fun song about telling an ex to piss off. It makes you remember all the people who have wanted to sing the lyrics of this song too over the years.\n\n Victim of Circumstance - It's all about begging for another chance with a woman while denying any real responsibility. Haven't we all been there? It's a fast, loud, fun song. And it's well done from start to finish!\n\n Hungry No More - They slow it down to end the album. It's a soothing track where the vocals sound great but back to the earlier tracks where the lyrics don't do it for me. It's a great sound, just not great poetry.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"According to Ian Astbury, \"Hidden City\" is the third CD in a trilogy that started with \"Born Into This\" followed by \"Choice of Weapon.\"  If it's a trilogy in any musical way, I don't get it.  But at any rate, \"Hidden City\" is a solid CD that any Cult fan will enjoy even if it breaks no new ground.  In fact, at this point, it seems the Cult is simply making solid if not spectacular music which has its moments, but doesn't trailblaze as they once did.  And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nIf I'm to rate this \"trilogy\" I'd say the best of the lot is \"Born Into This\" (which I largely loved, unlike many), which gets 4 1\/2 stars, followed by \"Hidden City,\" which is between 3 1\/2 and 4 stars, and \"Choice of Weapon\" which is 3 stars.\n\nThere are some really good songs here, especially \"Dark Energy\" and \"Hinterland.\"  I agree with others who indicate that the CD is a lot more bluesy than we've heard from the Cult in recent memory.  It's solid if not particularly distinct.\n\nBut the real problem is the continued fraying of Ian Astbury's voice.  He's hoarse much of the time, and has problems zero-ing in on the notes he's trying to get to.  You can tell he just doesn't have the vocal control he once had.  A voice is a finite resource and they all give out.  Ian's best days are clearly behind him.\n\nBut who cares, it's still The Cult, and they're still a great band.  They don't need to be giving us new music, and I'm just grateful that we have some new material from them.  Maybe I'll be listening to \"The Cult\" and \"Ceremony\" and \"Love\" a lot more than this (not to diminish \"Sonic Temple\" but for some reason I don't play it as much as other CDs of theirs).  But it's still nice to have new music from Ian and Billy.","classification":4,"fold":9}

(or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review...

{"text":"If you're a Goo Goo Dolls fan (& why else would you be here?!), you'll very much enjoy their latest 2016 release, \"BOXES\"!!  It very much continues The Goo Goo Doll inimitable pop\/mainstream sound,with one foot being squarely in the rock category.\n\nIf you're a fan of their very, very early work, which was based more in the punk\/rock ethic, then you probably won't like \"BOXES\" (simple as that) but give it a listen, anyway.  Maybe your listening predilictions have changed some, by now, also & you like \"different music for different moods\",  I believe if The Goo Goo Dolls had stuck with their original format, not too many of us would have heard of them; perhaps, they never would have even left Buffalo, New York (although that's where their roots are & they performed \"Live in Buffalo on July 4, 2004\" for free!!!)...once again, I admire this band.  (They may have made it, but on an independent label, which still might've reached the mainstream, but \"indie's\" only more recently a more acceptable & popular music genre.  Plus, you can go through hundreds of \"indie\" bands and come out with only a handful..maybe 2 handfuls that you like.)  The Goo Goo Dolls had much more music to give to the world with mainstream the best way of reaching the largest audience!!  After seeing & hearing that amazing July 4th Show (won't give anything away); I have even more  admiration & respect for The Goo Goo Dolls & I also feel \"why don't all bands perform like this, for their hometowns\"?!  These are genuinely nice guys!!\n\nFor myself, I'm very glad (as I'm sure hundreds of thousands of Goo Goo Dolls fans & the band, themselves are!) that they did change that early music style & that Robbey Takec was magnanimous with Johnny Rzeznik taking over lead vocals.  These guys go back a very long time (I couldn't find exactly how long, but it's long!)  It's a beautiful testament to  both The Goo Goo Dolls & Johnny & Robby's relationship that the band's been together so long & that on each CD\/lp, Robbey usually sings lead on 2 or 3 songs.  When I first started listening, it did take me a little while to get used to Robbey's voice; however, by now, it's nice to hear him on a few!!  Both, because it breaks it up & because it touches my heart.  \"BOXES\" is the first CD\/lp (I believe) that longtime bandmate, Mike Malinin isn't on drums with them...that had to be hard on the guys, but it doesn't show with these talented musicians..\n\nIf you love \"Magnetic\" rest assured of loving \"BOXES\" as well!!  It's all upbeat!  I also very much like \"Let Love In\" & would have liked a couple more songs with a slower-burn, & acoustic (which I'm usually not a big fan of,  but it's a part of The Goo Goo Dolls & it is missed.)  However, loving The Goo Goo Dolls, I can't pick fault with any of the tracks on this set!!!!\n\nThe Goo Goo Dolls long ago found a sound which works (extremely well!) for them & continue it.  No song sounds exactly like another, and they maintain their sound, which, I imagine, isn't always easy to do, when you've written as many songs as Johnny Rzeznik.  They've also managed to have an \"ageless\" sound; meaning that, they've escaped sounding too closely affiliated with one particular decade...Bravo, guys!!!!  You can go on \"ad inifinitim\"!!!  I continue to be a fan, especially because they have a solid rock backing to their brand of pop!!  \"BOXES\" continues The Goo Goo Dolls reign as \"Top of the Pops\"!!!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my first time purchasing a Trina album. It's not that I haven't liked any of her songs in the past, because I have. I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists. I immediately took notice of her, though, with her 2000 (or maybe 1999) debut single, \"Da Baddest Chick.\" I actually liked the song initially--although it sounds a bit dated today--and the video, which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat, was pretty amusing, too. The next single was the summer-anthem, \"Pull Over,\" which had my head bobbing for quite awhile. I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles, including \"Told Y'All,\" the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott, and of course \"Single Again.\" I've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out, but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples. They just didn't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub-par. However, the samples for this album sounded much better, and with her initial success with this album--debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever--I decided to finally give one of Trina's album a try.\n\nThe album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro, which is just here to take up an extra minute. The smarter choice would've been to just begin the album with the first full-length track, \"Still Da Baddest.\" The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant, a perfect canvas for Trina's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business. (Believe it or not, this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade). The first single, \"Single Again,\" is also one of the best tracks from this set; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies' anthem. I really can't understand why the song wasn't very successful. \"Look Back At Me\" should definitely be a future single, with its simplistic, dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals. \"I Got A Bottle,\" which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott, is a fun and playful club song. On \"Clear It Out,\" Trina gives us a piece of her mind, stating how she is fed up with haters, critics, and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy. And \"Hot Commodity\" is a great closing track; it's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song. Unfortunately, those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with. The rest are pretty unexciting. \"I Got A Thang For You\" and \"Wish I Never Met You\" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date, \"Here We Go Again.\" (Which I didn't think was that great in the first place). The production isn't great, and Trina's rhymes are way too laid-back and lazy. \"Killing You...\" is bland and very repetitve and \"Phone\" is simply here for shock value, nothing more. Last, \"Stop Traffic\" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook. (Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know green means \"go\" and red means \"stop.\" That's not clever!)\n\nThe bottom line: So... I've finally bought a Trina album. While it's a bit better than I was expectting, Still Da Baddest is far from flawless. It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is no medium on here. It's either really good, or really bad, and there are just as many bad songs as there are good. Most of the time Trina's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great (except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads). What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production, hooks, or song ideas. If you're a Trina fan, buy it. If not, I wouldn't really recommend it. Sure there are some good tracks here, but they are barely worth it for me.\n\nKey tracks: Single Again, Look Back At Me, Still Da Baddest, Hot Commodity.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Smooth\" is a very fun and great pop\/rock song done beautifully by Carlos Santana.  I remember being in my senior year in high school when I heard this song. When I saw the video to this song being played on one of the music channels there was something about it that drew me on(I just wish that I can remember if it was VH1 or MTV). Carlos made the right decision when he selected Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to sing the vocals (Rob has a great singing voice). The reason why I say this is because I noticed that in the music video Rob Thomas really put his spirit and emotion in giving the musical \"Smooth\" a vibrant life of its own. \"Smooth\" is a gorgeous song about a man who is willing to change his life to accomodate the woman he loves, and he is asking the woman in his life to make up her mind about him. He makes this clear with the clever and catchy lyrics \"so give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it). I love and enjoy listening to Rob Thomas's vocals in this song. In addition, I was imagining who this song was for, especially when Rob Thomas did a good job of using his voice of emphasizing the lyrics \"my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa\" When I found out later on that it was for his wife Marisol Thomas I was very moved and thought that was romantic and heartwarming. I say this because \"Smooth\" came out in 1999. It is posted online that they met in 1998 and married in 1999. At the time of this writing, they are still married (which I think is so beautiful by the way, may they enjoy more joyful and loving years together). I admit that part of the reason why I still find this song enjoyable to listen to is because I enjoy hearing Rob Thomas's singing (Rob's music and vocals first drew me in with the 1997 Matchbox 20 musical hit \"Push\"). The best way to choose whether you are going to love this song is if you enjoy music by either Rob Thomas, Carlos Santana, and\/or romantic alternative rock songs.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Oh, Rod Stewart, what's happened to you? I miss the Rod Stewart of yesteryear - the rocker, party-animal and bad boy who gave us such hits as \"Hot Legs\", \"Rhythm of my Heart\", \"Forever Young\", and \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.\" Now we're left with a cover artist who's traded in everything that made him a star and appealing who churns out albums full of cover songs of old American classics. \"Fly Me to the Moon ... The Great American Songbook Volume V\" is really not that different from the first four albums of the American Songbook series. For one album, the one where he covered classic rock songs, there was a hint of the old Rod Stewart but now we're back to this crooner imitation that Stewart's been playing with for the past few years.\n\nIn listening to this album, I wanted to break down this review by tracks. Then I realized that there really was nothing great to say about the individual tracks on this album. I will start off by saying one good thing: thank goodness the music of this release is more upbeat and overall happier than the tracks chosen for the other songbook volumes. That simple change of going for the most swing\/upbeat orchestral arrangement of the songs makes \"Fly Me to the Moon\" stand out in the series.\n\nNow, for the bad news. My problem with \"Fly Me to the Moon\" and the other four volumes of this American Songbook series is that it is really lacking in Rod Stewart. I'll explain. I get it - as artists get older, they want to change or do something differently musically. This thing of covering old American classics, however, has been dragged out entirely too long in my opinion and is truly killing the musical legacy Rod Stewart made. These tracks are nothing more than high profile karaoke. Where's the feeling? Where's the emotion, the spark that makes you nod your head in appreciation of the sentiment and emotion; the unique spin that makes you feel like you're listening to Rod Stewart? This album, and the others of this American Songbook series are pretty annoying and disappointing because every track is sung almost entirely the same as the next. There's no real emotional exploration going on or personalization happening. To me, the tracks sound very similar and therefore feel uninteresting because it feels like Rod Stewart or his record company realize they'll make money with him being a cover artist either way and he's grown very comfortable not investing himself into the music or songs because they're already familiar to most of his audience.\n\nThis feels like a lazy effort from Rod Stewart with no real creativity or talent being exhibited. There are a few tracks worth listening to: \"Moon River,\" \"Sunny Side of the Street\", \"Fly Me to the Moon\" have traces of the old Rod Stewart but still, I find it hard to believe that the once rocker Stewart who in interviews likes to to point out how he doesn't feel old or irrelevant has gone from being such a stand out artist to being nothing more than a good cover artist. I'd like to have heard a few original tracks mixed into this album; we haven't been treated to truly new, original content from Rod Stewart in years and I believe all of this covering of the American classics he's done over the years has made him a bit weak as an artist because he's singing every song with the same emotion and tone and is showing little range. I say skip this. It's really not anything new or anything unique worth throwing your money at.\n\nListen to These: \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"Sunny Side of the Street,\" \"Moon River.\"","classification":1,"fold":9}

I give her kudos for being a shrewd old shrew in a business sense and also applaud her incessant bids at staying relevant in the entertainment business, which is by nature a fickle beast, with a lingering loyalty only to the almighty dollar. Madonna did this with electronica producer William Orbit back when electronic music became \"the thing\". All of a sudden, you've got U2, David Bowie, Perry Farrell, Boy George, everyone, trying to be like Chemical Brothers or Prodigy when they were flavour of the month back in the late 90s and early 2000s. Some artists, like Bowie and U2 succeeded and put out good albums that were electronica flavoured. IMO, Madonna's bid fell flat though.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"I will write this review based on a track by track review of the whole album.  Track one was a good solid rock song to open the album with lyrics that speak to one's soul and life experiences.  Track two is another good rock song speaking of how heavy it is to carry that kind of wieght on one's shoulders in the form of skeletons.  Track three discuss what it is like in life to feel betrayed by someone you care for and find out they are as mess up as you are.  Track four talks about having the need to have someone there to help hold you up and support you and your choices as you go threw life.  Track five shows you the ups and downs in a relationship and how hard it is to maintain it while wanting to feel the need to be loved.  Track six lyrics show us listeners how having such a good friend can making you take a hard look at yourself and clean up your life while feeling that friend is always with you in essense.  Track seven shows how we are all sinners day in and day out but how having your true love can save you from a bad ending.  Track eight is another great rock song discussing the fight within one's body and soul to turn their dark place into Light.  Track nine lyrics gives us fans a look at overcoming one's addictions and no longer being a \"slave to them\" because we all have a devil in us one shape or another.  Track ten discuss how we can be strong and stand up to the enemy and get rid of all the darkness in our lives for chance at light rest of our lives.  Track 11 shows a singer at the lowest point in his life almost breaking pont and then realize their is some hope at the end of the tunnel.  Track 12 is a song that discuss how \"Fear Hate Love\" can control our lives at certain points during our lives on this Earth.  First album in a long time that enjoyed every song start to finish and great mixure of rock, metal, and techno beats.  Reminds me of old school Papa Roach while maturing to pain, hurt, suffering we all experience as we age and become adults.","classification":5,"fold":9}

But anyway, the first time I ever heard of Gavin DeGraw was when I saw him on Last Call with Carson Daly (don't ask me why I was watching that). And his song \"Follow Through\" is pretty good, so I decided to see what his album, Chariot, was like.\nThere are some other good songs on here, like the title track and the song he has out now, \"I Don't Want to Be\". And when I looked at the lyrics to \"Meaning\", I said, \"Oh boy, not another we-are-the-world song.\" But that song actually works pretty well. My favorite song on the album, though, would have to be the smooth \"More Than Anyone\".\nAs far as the rest of the songs go, they leave something to be desired, especially the filler track \"(Nice to Meet You) Anyway\". \"Chemical Party\" and \"Belief\" have rather stupid lyrics, and \"Just Friends\" is fine until Gavin says something about that her body fits him like a glove.\nI don't really Chariot is worth ALL the hype, but it's still a nice album to play to pass the time.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":9}

Having said that, I DO like it when bands experiment and try new things, and here it works on some songs, and doesn't on others (Satan Pulls the Strings is so good live...what did they do with it here? Sheesh).  There are quite a few slow tempo Avett songs here, so the pacing isn't great, but the slow songs are beautifully done.  I definitely agree with some of the other reviewers here who suggest that the Avetts ought to try a different producer (enough Rick Rubin already).  It would be interesting to see what someone else would do with these songs.

{"text":"What's interesting about Time? Astonishing!, the new collaboration album between Mello Music Group producer L'Orange and Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith, is that it comes on the heels of their \"Sometimes I Feel\" joint from Mello Music's wondrous Persona LP so either they built off the creative spark of the song or an album was already in the works and they just wanted to give a sneak preview. No matter how it came about, it's still a dope album. L'Orange has once again put together a breathtaking spread of old time noir beats over which his compadre Keith raps science and swagger with the help of some of their favorite emcee friends.\n\nAs a slick, fourth dimensional rambler, the Kool Keith we witness here is as sharp with his bizarre, fanciful techniques as he was at the height of his Dr. Octagon phase, randomly ad-libbing strange ecological findings in our present time period and in the future. In fact forget \"strange\" because some of the scenes Keith describes are straight up outlandish, some might say crazy even. He may not be the belly laugh inducing character he has been at times, but he sure is every bit the cool, meticulous field researcher of his doctor side, with a new specialty: time-traveling. Nowhere is this more evident than in \"Twenty Fifty Three (2053),\" \"I Need Out of This World\" and \"Upwards. To Space!\", three short glimpses into what is most likely the fate of humankind, or at least where these artists believe it to be headed.\n\nLet's not leave out L'Orange, a growing prodigy in his prime, who for all his skill at assembling his esoteric samples, vintage commercial clips and old movie-music loops still knows how to keep a beat with infectious hip hop drums akin to intelligent dance music. His beats are rapper- ready and at the same time, great all by themselves. Mad props must also go out to all the guests, for if not for them, Time? Astonishing! might just have been a short, sweet, two-man EP and nothing more. From top to bottom, they are J-Live, Mr. Lif, Open Mike Eagle, Blu, Montage One, DJ Trackstar, MC Paul Barman and MindsOne. Time? Astonishing! is alternative hip hop at its finest, and by beginning to explore the future of our species with intergalactic migration and cross-dimensional travel as possibilities, it certainly is venturing into unchartered territory, inside and outside of the music.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Old 97's for a while now, so it's easy for me to recommend \"Hit By a Train: The Best of Old 97's.\" The only problem I'm having is trying to figure out exactly why this is considered a \"best of.\" Quite frankly, each of their albums stand quite well on their own, and in many ways equals the overall quality of this collection. There are a few songs here that I personally would not have included, (\"their rendition of \"El Paso\", for instance), while there are plenty of songs from each studio album whose inclusion would have been easily justified (\"Wreck Your Life\"'s \"W-I-F-E\" and \"The Other Shoe,\" and \"Too Far to Care\"'s \"Streets Where I'm From\", for instance). Nevertheless, \"Hit By a Train\" is an entertaining listen from start to finish. In that sense, this is more of a sampler than a collection of their best hits.\n\nMiller has a tendency toward song-title puns that don't do justice to the songs themselves (\"Cryin' Drunk,\" \"Crash on the Barrelhead\" - not included here), but this only points out his self-consciously clever way with a phrase. The band has obviously mastered the two-step `train beat' (3 tracks here) and the hard-bouncing \"Texas shuffle\" (which accounts for eight of the CD's eighteen tracks), but it's Miller's lyrics that keep you coming back for more, even after repeated listens. Miller's albums as a solo artist certainly hold up well, but it's his work with Old 97's that is most effective, which is why this collection works as well as it does. How can you not love an album containing \"Barrier Reef,\" \"Lonely Holiday,\" \"Jagged\" and \"Victoria,\" all on the same disk? \"Hit By a Train\" encapsulates some of the band's best moments, and hardcore fans of the band will want this if only for the non-album tracks (the above-mentioned \"El Paso\" and \"Cryin' Drunk\"), but casual fans would do well to continue exploring their catalog further.

{"text":"As the title, cover art, and certain lyrics (read: all the lyrics) imply, this is a breakup record. The difference is that the breakup in question was not a romantic one (or at least I don't think so), but an artistic one - this is the first Elton John album without Bernie Taupin adding lyrics! Gary Osbourne provides them instead, and where Taupin is blindingly misogynistic, Osbourne is sickeningly obvious - honestly, if I hear one more song that contains the lyric \"Playin' with my heart!\" (i.e. \"It Ain't Gonna be Easy\"), I will get a bunch of other people who are sick of that lyric together and file a class-action suit against every songwriter who ever used the term, which means a lot of money would exchange hands. The good news is that, musically speaking it's still Elton, and Elton melodies and arrangements were always spot-on - indeed, the strings, guitar, and vibes on \"It Ain't Gonna be Easy\" are no exception to this rule. All it needs is better lyrics. Sadly, a lot of the \"rockers\" are bitter pills to swallow: \"I Don't Care\" is drenched in \"good-time\" synths; \"Part Time Love\" seems forced and has a dated guitar tone; \"Big Dipper\" sounds too much like \"Suzie (Dramas)\"; \"Madness\" is the closest Elton's come to arena-rock, and I'm glad he never came anywhere near again. Elton's better off when he sticks with balladeering, on gospel-influenced tracks such as \"Shine on Through\" and \"Georgia\" (with the famed Brit referring to it as \"his home\" - ha! Stupid Gary Osbourne. Was he from Georgia?). And, well... wait a sec? What was I doing praising the ballads? \"Shooting Star\" is a flaming bag of crap left on Taupin's doorstep! But the synth-drenched beauty of the instrumental \"Song for Guy\" sure isn't a bag of crap! It's a bit long, but still all right. Unlike most the rest, which is not all right at all.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Like Little Willie John and Jesse Belvin before him Billy Stewart remains a largely unknown and vastly underrated figure in the history of R&B. Billy Stewart was discovered by the legendary Bo Diddley who was so impressed by his ability to play the piano that he asked Billy to join his band back in 1956. Diddley even got Stewart a recording contract with his record label Chess in the late 1950s.  Nothing much came of it for a couple of years but beginning in 1962 he made several outstanding and really unique records. Most oldies fans will probably recall a couple of Billy's earliest hits including \"I Do Love You\" and the magnificent \"Sitting In the Park\" from the golden year 1964. But Billy wanted to appeal to a wider audience and was willing to take chances to achieve that goal. In 1966 he recorded the LP \"Billy Stewart Teaches Old Standards New Tricks\". The first single released from that album was Billy's rollicking interpretation of the George Gershwin classic \"Summertime\".  I think Ol' George would have approved. That tune would go on to become one of the surprise hits of 1966. Billys amazing vocal performance on this record will simply blow you away!","classification":5,"fold":9}

The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into \"Master of Puppets,\" arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing \"Fade to Black\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track \"The Call of Ktulu.\"\n\nDefinitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you're just getting into the band.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"When I first saw the video for Amy Winehouse's \"You Know I'm No Good\" on MTV, I was genuinely impressed. I heard numerous influences within her vocals and I was shocked that this 23 year old British Girl could sing like that.  A mix of Etta James, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin.  Just as fascinating was the production captivating the 1950s and 1960 R&B sound.  We as listeners and musicians often throw around the notion of neo-soul, but Ms. Winehouse is most definitely more \"soul\" than neo. BACK TO BLACK in my mind certainly serves as a clear anachronism to 1960.  Somehow, it does so in a way that doesn't turn off a younger group of listeners.  I mean, somebody is certainly tuning into the multiple plays that the video clip for \"You Know I'm No Good\" is getting on MTV and VH1.\n\nThe album opens like a classic Etta James affair with the repetitive (in a positive way) \"Rehab\" where the \"bad-girl\" Winehouse sings how \"they tried to make me go to rehab and I said no, no, no.\"  The production is classic with acoustic piano, horns, and a classic drum groove.  Everything sounds like the 1950s style of R&B coupled with the jazz of that time.  Ray Charles would've been proud to hear Mrs. Winehouse shed through this number, or the equally great \"You Know I'm No Good\". Once again, Mrs. Winehouse's bad girl persona arises as she sings \"I cheated myself, Like I knew I would, I told you I was troubled, you know that I'm no Good\".  Sure, \"You Know I'm No Good\" still keeps the jazz-influenced R&B sound alive, but there is enough of a modern sound here that it is clear why the clip is resonating with the youth viewing MTV.  \"Me and Mr. Jones\" keeps alive a string of hits.  Perhaps most alerting to fans is Winehouse's bad girl attitude (she belts: \"what kind of f**kery is this\").  If you stretch back to jazz history, one has to look no further than Mrs. Billie Holiday herself to her excesses of drugs and being \"one of the guys\".  Maybe Winehouse isn't that much of a stretch after all. Vocally, she is superb!\n\n\"Just Friends\" isn't quite as impressive as the latter tracks, but it isn't terrible either.  It is solid.  \"Back To Black\" is better, and it is one of few title tracks that breaks the trend for a sub-par title track. The production once again stands out with its looped jazz-piano riff.  Particularly impressive to me is how the production team managed to not only capture the 50s\/60s R&B sound but also how the managed to arive at the same sound and timbre of the recordings of those tracks.  \"Back to Black\" and \"Rehab\" in particular are great displays of that.  \"Love Is A Losing Game\" is absolutely stunning and it is great to hear Winehouse shed through a ballad. Her vocal facility is nearly flawless; every nuance is perfect and perhaps she is what Holiday was-- technically a limited vocalist (where range is concerned), but she made the best of it and it turned out to make her one of the world's greatest and most important vocalists.\n\n\"Tears Dry On Their Own\" doesn't quite feel as authentic, merely because it samples the blatantly obvious Ashford & Simpson penned soul classic \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\".  It isn't bad by any means as the songwriting is still strong and Winehouse remains at her best.  However, the originals sit better here.  \"Wake Up Alone\" gets things back on point with its classicist six feel, harkening back to the doo-wop tunes of the mid-50s.  \"Some Unholy War\" features some stunning background vocal works and subtle organ in the background. Not my favorite, but again, it is very solid.  \"He Can Only Hold Her\" uses a classic soul sample, but does so much better than \"Tears Dry On Their Own\" (side: John Legend lifted this same sample for his exceptional \"Slow Dance\" from his ONCE AGAIN album).  \"He Can Only Hold Her\" turns out to be one of my favorites and a nice end to the album (penultimate).  \"You Know I'm No Good [Remix]\" featuring the ubiquitous Ghostface Killah isn't bad either.  It is arguable to say whether or not Ghost truly adds any true substance to the remix, but it isn't in my opinion a bad way to end this phenomenal, perhaps MILESTONE album.\n\nAll I have to say is that Amy Winehouse has it going on and BACK TO BLACK is most certainly the most innovative R&B album of this year and just perhaps of the past couple of years. It screams GRAMMY to me.  4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":9}

However, in looking for the seasonal recordings to recommend, this one, THE GIFT, certainly has to be considered because of the overwhelming popularity of Miss Boyle and the consistently high sales of her recordings.  The voice is pleasant and communicative and honest and that is refreshing.  The few songs that are offered here do not a full album make, but Boyle does give a lovely rendition of the light popular voice offering Christmas wishes. She is not to be compared with classical singers because that is simply not her category.  And while many music lovers of all kinds of singing voices will and have snapped up the Christmas albums of, say,  Jessye Norman, Kathleen Battle, Kiri Te Kanewa etc etc, that is not to say this little recording is not worth adding to the collection.

{"text":"I mentioned in my Ludacris review that I was wondering where 8Ball and MJG have been lately. Well, my question was answered after hearing their Bad Boy debut, Living Legends. I just finished listening to the album, and it's like this: if you're a hardcore fan of Ball and G, then you won't hesitate to pick this up. As for the rest of us...\n\nLyrically, Ball and G are still impressive for the most part. But since this a Bad Boy record, you can't really expect this to be like their other albums. You have to be ready for one or two radio-friendly joints. But sometimes songs like that are just blatant. This is especially evidenced by the song featuring Bun-B, which rides an obvious made-for-radio beat, yet is called \"The Streets\". And then there are some questionable songs for the ladies, \"Forever\" featuring Lloyd (note to those that still don't know: Lloyd and Lloyd Banks are NOT the same person) and \"Trying to Get At You\" featuring 112. Love-oriented rap songs featuring 112 usually aren't more than filler; ask Mobb Deep.\n\nAnother filler track is the obligatory song about cars, \"Look At the Grillz\" (featuring T.I. and Twista). It's hard to enjoy the first verse especially, because whoever is rapping (T.I. or MJG) is doing it so low that I can barely hear him. And as far the interludes go, note to Diddy: \"Mad Rapper\" still isn't funny. And does anyone have any idea what the guy in \"Get a Kit\" is talking about?\n\nLike I said before, 8Ball and MJG still have it lyrically, except for maybe some of the choruses (\"Don't Make\", anyone?). But questionable production, dry subject matter, and lame guest stars damper the party. Other reviewers see it debatable as to whether they should be calling themselves living legends (but I don't agree with the person that said Onyx is a living legend), but as far as I'M concerned, it's like this: judging from this album, if one person says to another person, \"Man, 8Ball and MJG are living legends!\" the response wouldn't be, \"And they're still making great music!\" It would be more like, \"O...K...Nice to know it.\"\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"You have to hand it to Byrne for avoiding the mainstream yet continually coming up with memorable music for the past 35 years. He is undoubtedly a one-of-a-kind artist in the pop music world. I'd go so far as to say that he is the godfather of what is today known as Indie pop\/rock. With each release, Byrne successful (more or less) challenges his listeners to embrace something new.\n\nWith \"Love This Giant\" it is the addition of St. Vincent and the fact that each track is based around particular horn section arrangements--something that is unique in itself--I can't think of anyone else in the past 35 years that has attempted to make music such as this. That being said, it is still very much recognizable as something David Byrne would do. He always puts his undeniable, idiosyncratic stamp on whatever he does, thus making it totally David Byrne. St. Vincent, on the other hand, is less unique. I think she has trouble differentiating herself from Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Regina Spektor, Adele, P!nk, Feist, Bjork, etc. There's so many Indie female singer\/songwriters today, that St. Vincent sort of blends in.\n\nAt first listen, \"Love This Giant\" didn't quite strike my liking, but after listening for two weeks straight, I find it quite enjoyable. Once I got my head around the horn arrangements and the lyrics and melody lines, everything started to hook itself into my mind. From first single (and excellent video) \"Who\", with its quintessential Byrne shouts and intellectual solipsisms about love, to \"Ice Age\" where St. Vincent latches on. To \"I Am An Ape\", \"I Should Watch T.V.\", \"Optimist\"--which for me might be my favorite track here.\n\nThis isn't to say that \"Love This Giant\" hasn't any weak points. No, it does, especially at the end. \"Lightning\" might be the weakest track here along with \"The One Who Broke Your Heart\" and \"Outside Space And Time\". I deduct one star for this trio that closes the album on a somewhat weak note.\n\nSo, is \"Love This Giant\" as good as 2008's Byrne\/Eno collaboration, \"Everything That Happens Will Happen Today\"? No. Is it equal to, or better than, 2010's collaboration with Fatboy Slim, \"Here Lies Love\"? Yes. I'd say that \"Love This Giant\" is more focused, more succinct, and obviously, by default, much more brief and to the point than \"Here Lies Love\"--which certainly had its own merits to be sure.\n\nAlso, let's take a moment to talk about collaborations. Don't you think St. Vincent is an odd choice, and a rather weak one? I mean, just think about who Byrne could have chosen. Sure, he's worked with Brian Eno, and that's a well established and logical collaboration. Working with Fatboy Slim was unusual, but also a rather weak choice. I mean, let's do some interesting pairings here such as Byrne\/Tori Amos, now that would be interesting, or Byrne\/Bjork, wouldn't that be something exciting? What about Byrne\/Laurie Anderson? Two egghead intellectuals battling it out? How about Byrne\/Peter Gabriel? Maybe these would all be obvious choices? How about Byrne\/Trent Reznor? Byrne\/Pitbull? Byrne\/Shakira? The possibilities are endless. All I know is that when I saw he was working with St. Vincent I said to myself, who is that? I checked her music out, but I didn't think she was the right choice for Byrne. I mean, she's done just fine on \"Love This Giant\", but like Fatboy Slim, I felt Byrne could have done far better in choosing a collaborative partner.\n\nSo here's how \"Love This Giant\" compares with Byrne's previous works:\n\nByrne Solo:\n\n1981 My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts: Three Stars\n1989 Rei Momo: Four Stars\n1992 Uh-Oh: Four Stars\n1994 David Byrne: Four Stars\n1997 Feelings: Four Stars\n2001 Look Into The Eyeball: Three and a Half Stars\n2004 Grown Backwards: Three and a Half Stars\n2008 Everything That Happens Will Happen Today: Four Stars\n2010 Here Lies Love: Three and a Half Stars\n2012 Love This Giant: Four Stars\n\nWith Talking Heads:\n\n1977 Talking Heads '77: Five Stars\n1978 More Songs About Buildings And Food: Five Stars\n1979 Fear Of Music: Five Stars\n1980 Remain In Light: Five Stars\n1982 The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads: Three Stars\n1983 Speaking In Tongues: Four Stars\n1984 Stop Making Sense: Five Stars\n1985 Little Creatures: Four Stars\n1986 True Stories: Four Stars\n1988 Naked: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"There has no been question about Mariah Carey. She has been under a lot of pressure to really deliver with a strong cover. She has had a lot of weak cover songs that she has done over the years, from a lackluster cover of Journey's Open Arms, to a mixed cover of Brenda K. Starr's I Still Believe. While her best cover was of The Jackson 5's I'll Be There, she still needs to really deliver. With her latest single, a cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, the second single from her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, she honestly has not done that. The song was absolutely a very weak and less than strong cover for a few reasons. One of them is that she missed recording an entire verse of the song from when Foreigner did it 25 years ago, and the second is that it missed the heart and soul that had been made from the song for years. Next to when Wynonna Judd covered the song a few years ago, this honestly has to be the least-enjoyed version of the Foreigner classic. I thought this was not a good idea for it to be a single from the album, and I was right. Better luck with Memoirs, Mariah.

I'm also partial to 'My Everything', which is probably the most worshipful original song Adam Young has ever turned out under his Owl City moniker - I love this song.

{"text":"While \"Sigh No More\" took some time to get into because Mumford falls into that \"all their songs sound the same\" category, \"Babel\" is more easily accessible. Mumford & Sons' last studio album, \"Sigh No More\", has more single songs that pack an infectious wallop; however, it is \"Babel\" that provides longer-term consistency. What I especially like is the very minimal gap between songs which makes the album seem like a musical journey rather than a collection of songs. Single \"I Will Wait\" is the standout, especially with its crescendo of \"Raise my hands \/ Paint my spirit gold \/ And bow my head \/ Feel my heart slow\". The themes of light, darkness, heart, and colors play across the songs and tie them together well. The \"paint my spirit gold\" lyric from \"I Will Wait\" is one example of the wonderful imagery painted on this album. The album peaks in the middle with pace-changer \"Ghosts That We Knew\" which also builds to a sublime bridge of \"But hold me still bury my heart on the cold \/ And hold me still bury my heart on the cold\" which alone almost makes the price of the album worth it. Follow-up track \"Lover of the Light\" is Mumford at their best -- driving songs of love, desire, and mistakes made all sung with such passion that it makes you want to start the album over again once it ends.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"After eight long years Dead Prez is back with their third studio album and I must say this was not worth the wait. The content is still there, but the execution on this album is terrible. It feels like they were forced to change their sound on this just to try and attract some attention from people who wouldn't normally listen to them.\n\nInterludes aside, the first half of the album sounds like they used the same beat for every song only slightly altering the tempo. That wouldn't be a problem if the production was dope, but it's not. It sounds like some Justin Bieber\/Flo Rida\/Lady Gaga music. The first half of the album is literally Dead Prez rapping about normal Dead Prez topics, but they're doing it over dance music. Why? What were they trying to accomplish by doing that?\n\nThe second half of the album provides a little more diversity sonically, but it still isn't anything spectacular. What baffles me is that the two best beats on here are used for the two \"GHN\" interludes. When I heard the first one come on I got all excited because it actually sounded like a Dead Prez beat, but neither of these gentlemen capitalized on the opportunity.\n\nThe production isn't the only issue I have with this album. Both stic.man and M-1 sound dead on this. They lack any genuine energy and they both feel very uncomfortable on these songs. Plus, there's times where it seems like they're just trying to throw as many rhymes together as possible, regardless of whether it makes sense or not.\n\nStandout Songs: \"Learning Growing Changing\" & \"Download (Expand Beyond)\"\n\nOverall Score: 4\/10 - The moment I heard \"A New Beginning\" back in September I knew there was no hope for this album. I read someone say that if you don't like this then you're close minded, that's kind of ignorant. It's called an opinion. Dead Prez have set standards for themselves and this didn't live up to them. Hopefully we can hear them return to their Hip Hop roots on their fourth album.","classification":2,"fold":9}

Totally forgot I signed up maybe a year ago hoping I'd be informed when a new record or album came out.  The site did not disappoint.  Soon as I heard the sample they linked me to I clicked the link.  But oh no, the link is to iTunes.  Heck no, I came right here to dependable Amazon and got that puppy for .30 cents less!  Ha, Ha... Plus I can play it on any device not just an iTunes device.  Playing it as I type this.\n\nI remember when her ex tried to take ALL her money including any future profits from future music.  Oh heck naww.  She fought like a mad woman and was willing to go to jail to prevent her ex-husband from getting everything she owned.  All she wanted to do was explain to the judge how it was and is.  Finally the judge let her speak instead of her lawyer, the judge GOT IT and ruled in her favor.  She had to give up a lot of millions because the ex did have a part in some of her previous albums but a one time lump payment is way better than paying that sap forever!\n\nThis woman has been through some stuff and has never turned to drugs, alcohol or the like... she turned to the one and ONLY...

{"text":"\"Undercurrent\" is the fifteenth solo piano release from Michele McLaughlin in as many years, and I am always re-amazed with each new album at how far she has come as a pianist and composer over the years. Her first few albums were recorded on a digital piano and although she still records at home, she now composes and records on a Fazioli F212 concert grand. What a difference and what an amazing piano! Mastered and engineered by Joe Bongiorno (Piano Haven Studio), the piano sound is rich, warm, and very expressive. The album was inspired by Platos quote: Always be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle, and the music is reflective of several of McLaughlins own battles as well as many wonderful moments from the past two years. The thirteen tracks vary in style and mood from serene and peaceful to joyful, turbulent, and pensive. Fellow pianists will be excited to learn that there is a companion songbook for this album available in hard copy or download, as individual pieces and as books with all thirteen songs.\n\n\"Undercurrent\" begins with 11,000 Miles, a buoyant and carefree piece inspired by the two-month, 11,000 mile concert tour McLaughlin did with Scott D. Davis in 2013. Light-hearted and quickly-flowing, it clearly expresses the joy of sharing music and the adventure of traveling to new places. Although much more subdued, Living In Awe conveys a different kind of joy. The first piece McLaughlin composed after moving to her mountainside home, it conveys her contentment and happiness in her new environment.  The Space Between is one of my favorites. Quite a bit darker than the first few tracks, it reflects on the distance between Michele and her sister since moving about ten miles away after being neighbors for many years. Strong feelings of loss and sadness run through the piece, made dramatic with an active left hand at the lower end of the piano and a very poignant melody. I also really like the title track, which is also on the dark and powerful side, thinking about the battles everyone must face and deal with no matter how bright and sunny their lives appear to be. Starstuff returns to a much lighter mood, and was inspired by Carl Sagans quote We are all made from starstuff. Passages are played in the upper registers of the piano and sound to me like the twinkle of stars in a dark sky. Never Give Up is encouragement without words and a reminder that no matter how difficult times may seem, there is always beauty in life and light at the end of the tunnel. Melody In Motion is a lively minor key waltz that expresses how McLaughlin feels when she composes and the excitement when a new piece begins to emerge from her fingertips. Stepping Stones is a heartfelt, pensive piece about the paths we take in life based on the decisions we make. Synesthesia brings the album to a close with a piece composed on a rainy day on the road. Although lively and energetic, there is a moody cast to the piece that gives it a very soulful quality that I really like.\n\n\"Undercurrent\" adds several new chapters to the autobiography that is Michele McLaughlins musical output. Deeply personal yet universal and very accessible, it brings together so much of lifes shared experience, reminding us how interconnected we all are. Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Matraca Berg has been writing hit country songs for quite some time. This collection of her performing a set of her material is an ethereal experience. It is such a subtle production, but seething with emotions.\n\n  Berg sings songs that are so poetic, yet so real in human experience. The musical textures are subtle yet they so augment her vocals. The art work for the cardboard CD case is beautiful. Dualtone Records released this recording for her. The Musicians are the best that Nashville has to offer. There is a haunting feel to the music with the steel guitar fades and sparse feel. Dan Dugmore gets some sounds out of his steel on \"You & Tequila\" that are like other worldly.\n\n  \"Racing The angels\" has Suzy Boguss and Gretchen Peters on background vocals and also as co-songwriters.\n\n  If you never have heard of Berg, her sound on this CD is a cross between Kathleen Edwards and early Mindy Smith. There is a dark feel to the mood, but there is something deeply personal there you can relate to.\n\n  \"Clouds\" - I love this song, \"only like clouds when it's rainin', doin' no good just hangin' round\".\n\n  The title track  is basically just her and piano .  With the watered down glut of Discs littering the internet, this is a masterpiece. After I finished doing this review, I saw Kenny Chesney's version of \"You And Tequila\" on a CMT video, from his last CD, \"Hemingway's Whiskey\".

The fact is that it took her more than 3 years to release this shows us perhaps Alanid should try out other things then making albums.\nShe get rids of Glen Ballard and writes and produced the album on her own which of course nothing wrong with that. But it shows she is new at this when listening to the album. The album lacks in brilliant hooks and good melodies and lyrically it is far from being amazing. She obviously has nothing more to say and repeats what she was singing about on her previous LP's which was slef - discovery and her bad luck with Men. This album is about finding men and love and it makes you think after listening to this album perhaps Alanis may have been a bit unfair to the guy she sang You Oughta Know about. When I come to think about it she is not a girl that I would like to date.\nNice try Alanis but better luck next time. Hey wasn't she supposed to release two albums in 2002 but only released one.

I'm not sure anyone really knows where it originated or when. Nearly every populated continent and nearly every people throughout history have used this basic structure in some form. One might argue it seems we're wired for it from birth. From before time. I can't think of a call and response song that isn't fairly strong with emotion. Its something that speaks to the core of the social animal in us. That being part of something larger. The sense of unity and belonging. Strength in numbers.\n\nThis song straddles an oddish space between Queen's We Will Rock You and the Masters of Reality's album Blue Garden. The verse has that same angry aggressive bite and cadence much like We Will Rock You, but the chorus is much like the metal infused bluesy tripadelic fueled melodies found throughout Blue Garden.\n\nRegardless it feels Southern and bluesy, full of desperation and angst. It could be prayer uplifted as much as funerary lamentation. It could be sang at the church's pulpit or the town pub, it doesn't much matter. Because even the children know the song.

{"text":"There is so much that Robin Thicke has gone through the past several years in regards to his own career. Musically, he has tried to rebound, after losing a massive lawsuit from Marvin Gaye's family in regards for Blurred Lines using one of Gaye's classics Got To Give It Up, and personally his life has been in shambles, with the end of his marriage to Paula Patton whom he had a falling out and lost his marriage a few years ago, and his song Get Her Back and his Paula album were massive failures. He has tried to bounce again with Morning Sun, which worked back to his classic sound nicely. His latest song which teams up with cheap rapper Nicki Minaj, whom she does not bring enough into the song, and instead makes it lose its shine for Robin. It is alright, but not a song that has longevity in star power, the way that Magic and Sex Therapy did. Hopefully, Robin will have better to get him back in the rebound.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"First off, I just saw CF in chicago a few days ago and all I can say is that they absolutely killed. I swear for the first 45 min they didn't even get beyond songs from '86. They only played 3 songs off the new one, a couple off Pandemonium & the rest were true classics. Cheers to the boys for assembling such a killer set list and for hiring a qualified sound guy (which is a lot more than what i can say for the Lamb of god show I saw the night earlier - yeesh!).\n\nNow on to the album .... yeah it isn't as heavy as the old days but these guys have never put out an album that you could anticipate or expect. There are some truly heavy songs on here and Tom's trademark guitar sound is still there & the new drummer really does seem to fit well w\/ the others. A few songs on here are a bit Bauhaus\/Sisters of Mercy influenced & tempo (gee that wouldn't be Martin Ain now would it?)but at least it isn't that cold lake crap. It takes a few listens but it is truly a unique record for such a heavy band. If you get the chance to see 'em play live do it - they sound great and won't tour too much after this. Pick up this cd for sure but pick up all the pre-cold lake releases if you don't already have 'em first. Morbid tales is one of the best death metal albums ever.","classification":4,"fold":9}

His songs still have been great reflections of a good singer.songwriter. But every once in a while a great songwriter has had a song that is alright, but not anything to rave about. Made To Love, the third single from his album Love In The Future, is alright but it doesn't actually ignite to the best that matches with his other tracks from the album like Who Do We Think We Are and All Of Me had shown. Still, it isn't a bad song but not really as good as I have heard from John before.

{"text":"When it has came down to what Michael Jackson made into his voice and the way he made dance for so many singers and entertainers was one of a kind. Yet, his passing 5 years ago remains one of the most deviating losses of all time. Still, his music and legacy will live on well. Yet, his cavalcade of unreleased songs just has not been able to deliver and instead feels much weaker in voice and in heart as well. Love Never Felt So Good, the lead song from the upcoming escape album has not been able to deliver. It tries and harkens with a much more Disco-style rhythm. But having Justin Timberlake, one of many whom were inspired by Michael Jackson doesn't actually deliver in on the song. Considering when Michael had his final record Invincible released, Justin was still a part of N'SYNC. I really am not a fan of the song, and if you are new to Michael Jackson's music, you should just consider the songs he had released while he was still alive.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"VITTORIO GRIGOLO.  Watch for the name to soon be on the lips of every lover of opera - especially the good old chestnuts from the Italian repertoire.  Grigolio is only 33 - a fine age for a tenor to begin to sing the major roles - but he seems to have it all, from strikingly handsome good looks, soul, rather phenomenal stage presence, and a voice that can fill a huge hall or reduce an audience to utter silence as he almost whispers sotto voce phrases. This is an important recording because it allows us to have a starting point (excluding the very popular recording 'Vittorio' that offered love songs about four years ago - perfect for that young age).  His technique in vocal production, the range of his voice that seems to find no strain, his immersion in the roles represented on this very generous sampling, and the above all the extraordinary beauty of the sound he produces are all in evidence on this recital.  He is amazing: he seems ready to assume the mantle of the next great Italian tenor.\n\nThis well engineered recording doesn't have a weak track.  The orchestra is the Teatro, Regio di Parma  resident orchestra  conducted  by Pier Giorgio Morandi and while the orchestral sound is not the most opulent it is at all times in keeping with  the colors of emotional range of Grigolo.  The arias are all from the works of Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini and for now that narrow range seems fine.  But instead of paying attention to the minutia, the major point here is to listen to the glories that come from this young gold mine of a tenor.  No matter how many times we have heard 'Che gelida Manina' or 'Una furtiva lacrima' or 'E lucevan le stelle', hearing Grigolo makes them sound fresh and alive and transporting.  The same can be said for all the arias he has elected to present to us as his first operating outing.  Sit back, listen to the not only the perfection of phrasing and technique, but listen to the beauty of this extraordinary new gift to the opera world.  He is astonishing!

{"text":"Although many people say that The Black Album or Master of Puppets are Metallica's best albums, don't get me wrong they're great albums and they're in the 5 star worthy material but Ride the Lightning is my favorite Metallica and quite possibly my favorite thrash metal album, I think that 5 stars is not enough for Ride the Lightning, I easily give this album an 11.\n'Fight Fire With Fire' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead's heaven and it's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song. 10\/10\n'Ride the Lightning' is the title track and it's another Metallica classic although it isn't nearly as fast as the previous song but it's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead's mind. 8\/10\n'For Whom the Bell Tolls' starts off with the tolling bell and although I didn't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome. 10\/10\n'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10\/10\n'Trapped Under Ice' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it's still a good song especially compared to their post-Black Album era. 7\/10\n'Escape' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot, and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans. 9\/10\n'Creeping Death' is another standout for this album and it's one of their heaviest songs off of this album. 10\/10\n'The Call of Ktulu' is the closing track and believe it or not, I actually didn't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a row and never get tired of it, Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal's best instrumentals of all time. 10\/10\nIf you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Norman Brown is a great guitarist and this cd is another very good cd from a great guitarist and the writing is what seperates Brown other very good guitarists. Sending My Love, Here's My Number, Coming Back, as well as One Last Goodbye are my favorites. The song Play Time has some fast latin-like rhythms. This is excellent music to listen to while taking a short 1 hour trip because the pace and style of the music varies enough that it does not sound the same throughout. The song titled Celebrate Me Home is a gospel-jazz sounding number that uses the Sounds of Blackness choir as well as vocals from Brown and his daughter Rochela Brown and this song is a departure from what has been on Brown's albums before so it takes a couple of times listening to get what Brown is trying to do, especially if you never heard the original version of the song. If someone is looking for a jazz record that's not just a slow,smooth record, this is it.

{"text":"Last year, Band of Horses released a truly impressive debut album \"Everything All the time\", containing several instantly classic songs like \"The Funeral\" and \"The Great Salt Lake\". Despite pretty much non-stop touring since them the guys are back already with a new album.\n\n\"Cease to Begin\" (10 tracks, 35 min.) is an equally impressive album. The opener \"Is There A Ghost\" starts off very BoH-like, only to crash into electric guitars and very up-tempo about 1 minute into the song, bringing the message that these guys have expanded their musical pallet. \"Ode to Lag\" follows, with equally strong music. The good tracks keep coing: \"No One's Gonna Love You\" is a great pensive tune, as is \"Detlef Schrempf\" (yes, he the German former NBA basketball player), and \"The General Specific\" closes the first half of the album, an exuberrant tune. After a short instrumental, the second half kicks off with a rousing \"Islands On the Coast\", followed by a great, somber \"Marry Song\", with superb underlying keyboards. Yet the best is still to come! \"Cigarettes Wedding Bands\" is THE stand-out track of the album, sure proof how much BoH has matured musically in just a year's time. The closer \"Window Blues\" is too twangy\/country for my liking, and the least interesting track on the album.\n\n\"Cease to Begin\" is an outstanding album, and equal, if not better, than \"Everything All the Time\". They have not so much abandoned their early-My Morning Jacket-soundalike style, but expanded on it, to great effect. I've had the good fortune of seeing Band of Horses last year during the \"Everything All the Time\" tour, and if you have a chance to see these guys in concert, don't miss them, you will be blown away. Meanwhile \"Cease to Begin\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This album is a book of exciting stories which draw your attention from the first chords and you will want to listen to this beautiful music deeper and further. Koris piano compositions are very diverse, but all of them are heartfelt and filled with pure and natural emotions.\n\nExact naturalness is a very important feature of the album Fire in the Rainstorm. Kori intends to bring the listeners into her innermost feelings and deepest emotional experiences. Her music flows like an unrestrained mountain stream. It is always unexpected and wild. And this music is captivating because it is born from the depths of the artists heart.\n\nKori Linae Carothers is a perfect pianist. Her compositions are filled with divine harmonies and elegant passages. It is refined food for true musical gourmets. The album Fire in the Rainstorm is a piece of art of the highest quality and it is very inspiring. I can only add here that it is not surprising because this release was produced by famous Will Ackerman, Tom Eaton and Kori Linae Carothers and mixed and mastered by Tom Eaton at Will Ackermans Imaginary Road Studious.\n\nAll of Koris compositions are brilliantly composed and masterfully performed, and the listeners can easily to empathize with her expressive music. You have just to open your heart and feel all the beauty of the endless inner world of the artist. The piano music of Kori Linae Carothers will heal your soul and release it from accumulated severe experiences.\n\nThere is much love in the music of Kori Linae Carothers.

{"text":"This is Carly Simon's most recent album -- from 2009.  The 10 songs comprised are complete re-workings of her earlier hits, plus 2 new, never-heard-before tracks.  Some of the musical arrangements actually come out even better than the original studio versions.  For example, \"Boys In The Trees\" has a much more layered, lush acoustic arrangement.\n\nSome of the other re-workings that I enjoyed were \"You're So Vain\", \"Let The River Run\", and \"Anticipation.\"  But the crown jewel and pinnacle (not to mention my personal favorite) on this LP is her earliest 1971 hit, \"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be.\"  Carly has always been a great storyteller, and the drastic re-working of this song still applies a lot of context.  I love the entire, layered, high quality melody of the song too -- it's one of the best tracks that Carly has EVER sung from her entire 35 year career.  :)  It's one of those songs that I tend to put on repeat whenever I'm in a relaxed mood.\n\nI recommend this CD for Carly purists and casual music listeners.  Her catalog has continued to stand the test of time, and you certainly won't be sorry once you've heard this record.  :)","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"It is so sad whenever we have a artist become so overexposed, that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside. The tragic truth about Beyonce' Knowles is that she is a product, not even a singer. Her albums have been so poor, that she does not impress me anymore. Now, with the oversaturation she had endured with making Lemonade, many people wonder if it was worth it, and tragically it is not worth it at all. The album in itself has been her lowest performing in not just sales, but airplay as well, since the failure of 4. Beyonce's latest single is more of heartbreak in regards to her marriage with Jay-Z, and also the failure of her mom, Tina's marriage ending in divorce, after Matthew Knowles cheated on Tina, and fathered a child out of wedlock. Hold Up, the third single from Lemonade, is the exact same and so-called heartfelt feeling of being taken for granted at the affair of the heart. But tragically, Beyonce Knowles fails to impress at the soul of the song. She really felt more spooked at the essence in her voice, but overall it really does not work at every note. If you're new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back to Crazy In Love, and trust me it feels better than the wasted heart of Hold Up.\n\nSong: D 1\/2-","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"This album has been getting some generally positive reviews on the progressive rock website ProgArchives so I thought I would check it out.  I absolutely love it, hence my five star review. This is a grand slice of progressive rock that had my complete attention throughout the entire 2-hours.\n\nAs a progressive fan, what I liked the best about this album was the wider use of melodies and warm tone colors like acoustic piano and guitar, and a real string section -the incorporation works really well (no, this is nothing like that horrible concerto written by Deep Purple). There is also a wider range in dynamics than on previous albums. The music ranges from delicate passages of vocals accompanied by soft acoustic guitar, to the full-blown passages of dizzying acrobatics with both time signatures and ensemble playing that the band is known for. There is also a choir to round things out.\n\nOf course, I was really curious if a song-cycle this long could be pulled off without straining the patience of the listener (meaning me).  I am happy to say that these guys pulled it off - in my opinion, they are the only musicians active in the current progressive scene that could achieve this.  I guess it goes to show you that formal musical training (most of the guys either attended or taught at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA) really goes a long way. Although vocalist James LaBrie serves as a narrator at times, I liked how the acoustic piano is also used (almost) as a narrator - the short interludes\/postludes of acoustic piano tie everything together logically. I also appreciated how they didn't recapitulate themes (or restated themes so subtly that it was not noticeable) - this can be really dull if not handled properly. The one thing that I did not like so much was that the ballads were a bit maudlin at times - not a big deal.\n\nThe production quality is very good - I can actually hear John Myung!  I thought that the drum sound could be a little better, but it is not bad - besides, Mike Mangini is an absolute monster on the drums so it all balances out in the end. The CD packaging is lavish to say the least.  It is loaded with artwork associated with the concept, which is reminiscent of 2112 by Rush (1976). The CD comes as a foldout digipak that is deluxe in every sense of the word. There is a good balance\/separation of individual instruments.\n\nAll in all, this is a fine album of progressive that I found to be varied and very engaging. This is what progressive rock used to be like for me as a teen - exciting. I have the deepest respect for these guys as musicians and hope they continue to write the music that they feel is true to themselves for as long as possible. Barring any significant culture shift, this may very well be the case.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

I think when you portray an artist like Ray Charles in such a successful motion picture, it sends such a strong message that the public's expectation may supercede the actual artist.  Personally, this release was much more juvenile than I expected and even more so than his first release.\nThe music and melody are somewhat forgetable and lack creativity.  I think most R&B artist today could take a few lessons from Musiq who music and message always so creative, different which is why he is so appealing.  THe voicebox has become so annoying and I truly think that Roger Trapman is the only one who could do it right.  I couldn't understand having another artist song remixed on your CD.

With her personally though, her love life has been destroyed again with her breakup with Marc Anthony, but her work on American Idol has been supreme with a new decade of fans. Musically though, it has been a lackluster thrive in her songs. Papi, the third single from her lackluster Love? album. I really felt that the song was more like a throwback to the rhythms of her 2000 J. Lo  record, and not really as strong as she could've brought it out to be.

{"text":"Great song from 1985 used in the Rocky 4 movie. James Brown was a major force in American music since the 1950's. I don't believe James was given due credit as he sang to ethnic audiences. Whereas, say, Chuck Berry, sang to a white audience (Chuck was a genius. I don't know how he was able to relate\/sing to a white audience). James Brown is the \"God Father of Soul\". I miss you James, your enthusiasm and your talent. Listen to many black artists and they claim influence from James Brown. For example, the \"King of Pop\" Michael Jackson did many of James Brown dance moves. For some strange reason Amazon encoded this song at the bizarre rate of 247 kpbs. No matter, buy this song! Listen to the fade out at the end of the song. James sings \"I feel good\" as a reference to his 1965 popular song. Also, James's reference to \"Eddie Murphy eat your heart out\". This is in reference to SNL's Eddie Murphy's \"getting in the hot tub\" spoof of James Brown.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Curren$y's second album on WEA, The Stoned Immaculate came out at just the right time for the summer of 2012. I was able to hear the album a few days before it's release and see a few videos for the album. Unlike the past few albums and mixtapes, he aims for commercial sounding style of production rather than the mellow style that he had on the past albums. While not too commercial as in such as heard on the radio, but the production here can appeal to a larger audience and he can flow just as good as on it. Another big difference is unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Weekend-at-Burnies\/dp\/B0050546YG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Weekend at Burnies<\/a>, he has a more wider selection of guests here rather than just his homeboys from the Jet Life crew (ie. Trademark and Young Roddy). With this album expect a slight difference in the way it flows compared to the previous ones he has made.\n\nThe first song is the first single \"What It Look Like\" featuring Wale, as a great starter for the album. Following that is \"Privacy Glass\" is pretty hot. One thing I noticed about this album is that Curren$y rhymes less about smoking and more about females. Expect a few songs about them on this album as well such as \"Privacy Glass\". \"Armoire\" has a great beat and features Trademark and Young Roddy on the hook. Thankfully that is the only time we will get to hear them on this album (not saying that they are bad but I just gotten tired of them). J.U.S.T.I.C.E League produces the next track \"Take You There\" featuring Marsha Ambrosius. Obviouslly telling that she is on the song it's aimed for a commercial style track, which is overall good just by the way it sounds. The next track \"Showroom\" has that older sounding style that Curren$y uses on his previous albums. \"Capitol\" features 2 Chains and its a pretty hot track as well as the video for the song. \"No Squares\" has him colaborating with his old parter in rhyme Wiz Khalifa for a hot track. The next track \"Sunroof\" with Cornerboy P another member of the Jet Life family is pretty solid but not as rememerable as the other tracks. \"Chasing Papers\" and \"Thats The Thing\" has odd colaborations with Pharrell Williams and Estelle respectively, another obvious attempt for mainstraim success. The latter song is another female friendly track. \"Chandelier\" is one of the best songs of the album, as Curren$y flows perfectly over the production here. The next song \"Fast Cars, Faster Women\" featuring Daz Dillinger is another great song. The last song on the album is my favorite \"Jet Life\" with Wiz Khalifa and Big K.R.I.T. on the hook. The track helps end the album on a high note.\n\nOverall Stoned Immaculate isn't better than his previous album. I would say its more of a side step rather than a step forward. There are obvious attempts at mainstream success here, but I wouldn't be going far as to say that Curren$y sold out. He still has that nice flow as on previous albums, but here the production style is a little different. This is definately one of the best albums of 2010, and I recommend it to those who are interested. While I'm at it, I wonder if its possible that we can get a \"How Fly 2\" mixtape\/album? Both artists are under WEA so it shouldn't be that hard to put that together. Peace.\n\nNote: If you download this album on iTunes or Amazon mp3, you get three bonus tracks.\n\nLyrics: B\nProduction: B+\nGuest Appearances: B\nMusical Vibes: A-\n\nTop 5 Tracks:\n1. Jet Life (featuring Wiz Khalifa and Big K.R.I.T.)\n2. Chandelier\n3. What It Look Like (featuring Wale)\n4. No Squares (featurng Wiz Khalifa)\n5.

{"text":"Frankly, on the face of it Patsy Cline would not fall into my idea of a torch singer. That is, until you heard that voice coming out of the past to chill you to the marrow with her heart-rendering versions of some very classic country and crossover ballads. For those of us who came of age in the late 1950's or early 1960's this was the music at the high school dance where you got to ask that guy or girl that you had your eye on for that slow dance that gave you time to talk and feel out the situation. Thanks, Patsy. This volume contains so many classics it is hard to know where to begin but I counted at least 15 that you ABSOLUTELY need to listen to. That, my friends, rather says it all. Classic Hank Willaims tunes like Cheating Heart, Willie Nelson's Crazy, others like Why's He Not You and She's Got Him. Wow. A few non-ballad novelty type songs could have been left out and done no damage but when you look at the overall package. Again, WOW.","classification":5,"fold":9}

And the song Life in Technicolor ii from the EP Prospekts March, the alternative 4:05 single (the version played in the music video) and not found on Viva La Vida, which only contains the 2:29 instrumental version called Life in Technicolor.  After first listening to that particular version, something appeared to be missing, the lyrics and the vocals.\n\nNonetheless, it is always a pleasure to listen to Coldplay.  Like most bands, they have indeed progressed in their sound, and for this song, it shows with its shimmering melody and rhythm by the arrangements and instrumentation as well as the poetic lyrics.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I was surprised by this album. At first, I was a bit disappointed that Henley had returned to his country roots (he is describing this more as \"Americana\") but, after giving this a handful of listens, lyrically and musically this has some of the best material that Henley has written in years. He's engaged as a songwriter and performer again. Given how far he is in his career, that's a bit of a rare thing. The bulk of the material that Henley also co-wrote for the last Eagles release is the best on that album as well.\n\nThe long list of guest performers on this album from Vince Gill to Miranda Lambert, Dolly Parton and Mick Jagger only enhance the material although Henley could have made the album without their help and it would have been as strong. Most of the material was co-written with Stan Lynch the former drummer with Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.\n\nThe covers are interesting as well--\"She Sang Hymns Out of Tune\" that I knew from a Harry Nilsson album--is engaging as well. The only reason that I didn't give this five stars is that some of the bonus material for the deluxe edition causes the album to sag a bit towards the end but it does finish with a strong final turn from Henley and Lynch.\n\nThis release combined the two solo releases that Henley had planned into one.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Type O is one of my favorite bands, and their album \"October Rust\" is my all-time favorite album. For a band with such a self-deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history, Type O Negative creates powerful, emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in (and helped create). And Peter Steele's dark vocals, once sort of a gimmick, have become integral to their brooding sound.\n\nAnyway, like I said, \"October Rust\" is the best album ever. But the follow-up, \"World Coming Down\", was rather disappointing. I was losing hope for the band when their last album, \"Life Is Killing Me\", turned out to be a significant improvement. While not as uniformly brilliant as \"Rust\", it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor. So I had high hopes for the newest release, \"Dead Again\".\n\nThe album is surprising in a lot of ways. First of all, many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material. Peter doesn't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around, and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before. A few songs break the ten-minute mark, something they haven't really done since their first record. And while much of their sound remains typically Type O, many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas.\n\nAccording to recent interviews, Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing, and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion. \"The Profit of Doom\" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse. \"These Three Things\" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel. \"An Ode To Locksmiths\" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis. \"Halloween in Heaven\" is a bit lighter in tone, dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven. And as usual, some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems. The title track \"Dead Again\" is about drug addiction, and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" deals with his anger management issues.\n\nThankfully, their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter. I laughed out loud at some of the song titles, such as \"Tripping A Blind Man\" and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow,\" and several songs have some hilarious lines. Among my favorites:\n\n\"I had no pulse last time I checked \/ I'd trade my life for self-respect\" (from \"Dead Again\")\n\n\"Elvis ain't dead, so he isn't here\" (from \"Halloween in Heaven\")\n\n\"If only I'd known how cool death is \/ I'd have killed myself sooner\" (from \"Halloween in Heaven\")\n\nAnd let's not forget their album liner notes. The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them. Not to be outdone, Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins. And in the section for equipment used, it says \"Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment.\" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing.\n\nEven though I think \"Life Is Killing Me\" had some better individual songs than \"Dead Again\", I think \"Dead Again\" is a better album as a whole.  The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform.  But that's just me.  It is a bit on the long side, but that's my only real complaint.\n\nAs a whole, fans of Type O should be happy with this release. The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years, but their style is undeniably intact. However, some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs. People bravely hoping for a return to \"October Rust\" territory will surely be disappointed as well. That era is gone, folks.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWith that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free \/ cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has been 30 years since Marvin Gaye made his last hit, Sexual Healing form the Midnight Love record. The song definitely still is a classic today, as it was when it came out back in the 80's, when Marvin really was coming to terms with redemption, and ultimately lost his life to the man that helped make him alive, his father Marvin Gay Sr., who murdered him 2 years later. The song is definitely one of those songs that still does not go out of style, even with Marvin's classic from his Motown era. I definitely still love this song so much. He really placed his signature on this ballad from top to bottom.

{"text":"This is one of Newman's best albums. It's just him, a piano, a microphone, and (what Newman claimed in an interview) about a dozen people in a club. It sounds like he's playing at your private party - you can hear the laughter of the crowd, of Newman himself, and all of the ambient noise of the club.\nSome of his best early songs are here: \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\" (a great version), \"Old Kentucy Home\" (this version lets you hear the great piano part much better than on \"12 Songs\"), \"Yellow Man.\" Also, two songs that were never released elsewhere: \"Tickle Me\" and \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong\" are both great and hilarious songs (the second song was recorded for \"Sail Away\" but not included - it is included on the recent re-release of \"Sail Away\" in orchestral version). Also included are some songs then yet to be released: \"Last Night I Had a Dream\" and \"Lonely at the Top\" which were both on \"Sail Away\" released after \"Live.\"\nThe album was supposedly released because Newman was taking so long in producing \"Sail Away\" and the record company wanted to keep momentum up. The public benefitted doubly: we got a great live album and a great follow-up.\nI had the privledge of seeing Newman in concert during the \"Land of Dreams\" tour some years ago. Again, it was just Newman and a piano. His show hasn't changed much (not that it needs to): he asks for requests and the audience begins shouting out song titles, he laughs during his songs, makes fun of himself and tells some great stories. Listening to Newman's early material shows that his style was set very early on, and he's been building on it ever since (though some think he's merely repeating himself, which I don't agree with).\nThe only thing that would be better than this album would be a follow-up. A live album from one of his recent tours with just him and piano. He's put out so much great material since then and sometimes his recordings hide his piano playing. It would be a happy companion to this great album.","classification":5,"fold":9}

The same old three cord progression on every song, stupid uninspired lyrics, and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package.  And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they're on MTV, well kids, this ain't real punk.  Real punk is Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Black Flag, and dare I say it, even NoFX.  Then again, there are kids scratching their heads wondering \"who are they, they're not on MTV, they're no good\".

{"text":"Already Gone is one of Kelly Clarkson's most haunting songs ever.\n\nA little precursor.\nKelly had originally wrote the song ALREADY GONE.  Producer Ryan Tedder, from One Republic, helped polish the song with Clarkson and then produced it.  Unfortunately for Kelly, after Ryan had finished work with Kelly on her album (with about 6 or so songs) he went to work with Beyonce on her new album.  Ryan used a similar, BUT NOT THE SAME, backing track for Beyonce's HALO. (Essentially a similar backing drum beat)\n\nBe it Beyonce's label or management, knowingly or unknowingly, put a rush to release HALO before Clarkson's camp had time to release ALREADY GONE.\n\nSince Halo was released to radio first, most listeners draw comparisions from Halo to Already Gone.  Kelly has been ridiculed for the similarities when it wasn't even her fault the situation occured.  She worked with Tedder first, and her song Already Gone was written and produced first.  After the fact, she heard Halo and called Ryan to voice her displeasure.\n\nKelly fought with her label to not release Already Gone as her third single. Not for the fact she doesn't like the song, but out of respect for Beyonce.  Since Halo was still on the charts, Kelly felt it would be disrepectful to Beyonce to release the song. Her label defied her wishes and released the song anyway.  Kelly has since changed the production of the song during her live performances on television and on her ALL I EVER WANTED TOUR to discourage any similarities from her song ALREADY GONE to HALO.\n\nNOW.\nAlready Gone ranks right up there with Because of You as one of her songs that you can feel the depth, the soul, the lyrics, and the emotion.  Kelly can sing anything and make it sound good, but she strikes it home with the haunting and gut wrenching ballads she so skillfully and masterfully performs.\n\nTHE VIDEO.\nJoseph Kahn was a little perturbed about the video to ALREADY GONE.  IF you will notice the song is actually well over 4 minutes long on the album.  The video is only about 3:30.  The video was shot to incorporate the entire song, but RCA feeling the video was too dark, edited a large majority.  The video that was left is centered around Clarkson with subtle hints that she is a ghost.  What the viewers are missing is some sort of death\/suicide scene which RCA felt would revert Kelly back into the My December ages.  Viewers and fans alike feel differently as a final conclusion would have made the music video complete.\n\nKelly is a true gem who is completely underrated.  This girl can sing anything.\n\nAnyone that denies her of her talent needs to see her live.\n\nI challenge anyone with a negative image of this girl go to a concert and come out feeling the same.\n\nIts okay if you don't like her music, but don't hate the girl.  She has threw away the typical Hollywood celebrity image and made her own.\n\nAs Kelly has said ALL SHE EVER WANTED is to make good music.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Signature - Solo\" is Fiona Joys long-awaited (by me, anyway!) first solo piano album, and what a beautiful surprise it is! Produced and recorded by Cookie Marenco, founder of Blue Coast Records, Signature is being released in several formats. (My review copy is a standard CD, but the sound quality is still amazing!) A classically-trained pianist from Australia, Fiona Joy has created an impressive collection of recordings beginning with her 2004 release, Portrait of a Waterfall as Fiona Joy Hawkins. Some of her more recent albums were recorded at Imaginary Road Studio and co-produced with Will Ackerman, who refers to Fiona Joy as one of the brightest lights in contemporary instrumental music. Signature was recorded on an 1885 Steinway piano, and every nuance comes through in breathtaking clarity. The album features a solo version of Grace, which was included in the 2014 Grammy winning \"Winds of Samsara\" by Ricky Kej and Wouter Kellerman, and a duet version of Once Upon Impossible that features Lawrence Blatt on acoustic guitar as well as Fionas ethereal vocals. Nine of the ten tracks are purely solo piano at its colorful, expressive best.\n\n\"Signature - Solo\" begins with Ceremony, a lively, upbeat piece that sets the tone of the album and tips listeners off that this is no ordinary solo piano album. Grace is likely to become one of Fiona Joys signature pieces, as it occasionally refers to some of her earlier pieces that haven't been as widely heard as her more recent work. Its a wonderful piece as either a piano solo or an ensemble piece, but I really love the solo version. The melancholy Fair Not has a flowing left hand that gives it a subtle energy. Dark and very expressive, this is somewhat different from much of Fionas other music. There are two versions of Once Upon Impossible - a piano solo that is poignant and heartfelt, and the second that includes Fionas vocals and light guitar accompaniment by Lawrence Blatt, a fine artist\/composer in his own right. Both are exceptional. Calling Earth is a somewhat shortened version of Earthbound from \"600 Years in a Moment.\" Invisible Train is my favorite track. High energy and very spirited, I hope sheet music is planned for this one! The elegant title track is slow, pensive and very heartfelt - gorgeous! As its title suggests, From the Mist is cool and has no hard edges - very fluid and free, colored in muted shades of gray and blue. Little Star concludes this very special album with a sweet and tender piece that tells its story simply and without a lot of embellishment.\n\nI truly hope this is just the first in a series of solo piano albums from Fiona Joy. Her elegant touch and soulful playing have always made her one of my favorites. I have been fortunate to have Fiona Joy perform two house concerts in my home, so I have been able to watch her play several times - always a treat that needs to be shared! Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. \"Mezzanine\" was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums [\"Blue Lines\", \"Protection\", and \"100th Window\"]. I think of all the MA albums I own, \"Mezzanine\" resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of \"Angel\". I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off \"Mezzanine\" has to be \"Man Next Door\" and \"Teardrop\". Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in \"Mezzanine\" into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that \"Mezzanine\" set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The rating I give is based on how much I like the song.  My opinion\n\nI don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","classification":3,"fold":9}

It is said that Winwood was seriously considering giving up on his musical career and this album was his last throw of the dice; what a throw!  The sparse instrumentation as compared with his group work plus the signature synthesizer which I personally like and think gives the album a unique sound allows for Steve to showcase his best talent i.e. his remarkable tone in his vocals without the rest of a band to distract from it and he bares his soul here with meaningful lyrics told by a master storyteller.  I enjoyed every track which are all consistently strong making this come in a close second to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Back-in-High-Life\/dp\/B00599UE1C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back in High Life<\/a>as his best ever album.  This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release is pretty good and although the design and assembly is not among the best that I've seen it is good enough coming with a very good inner sleeve and a foldout containing all the lyrics in Japanese only.  Overall this will please both the mlps collector as well as other fans as the sound quality has been remastered very well too.\n\nGood enough mlps design, good sound quality and excellent tracks makes this an easy review.\n\nRecommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The Beach Boys scarcely need another review, but it's worth saying that this is an excellent compilation.  Nearly the songs you'll really want are here and it gives a good overview of their career.  There are the early, relatively simple hits about girls, surf and cars when they summed up a generation with the peerless opening line of Fun, Fun, Fun: \"Well, she's got her daddy's car and she's cruised to the hamburger stand now.\"  Then the development of their amazing harmonic style in songs like God Only Knows in the mid-60s to the complex and sometimes extraordinary varied later material including, of course, Good Vibrations.\n\nSome songs have been remastered in stereo.  As an 11-year-old I spent a great deal of pocket money on Sloop John B. and so don't like it messed with, but actually the result is very close to the original and the other remasters are fine, too.  Also, any compilation will include some tracks you could do without and misses out others you would like.  Personally, I really miss 409 and Do You Remember here, but overall I think this is a very good collection indeed.\n\nSo...you can't really go wrong here if you want a good Beach Boys compilation.  Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Full-length new material release from Chicago. I am not sure under what counting method could this one be their thirtieth. Probably including compilations and Christmas albums. I lost track of Chicago since Night and Day album in mid 90s(22nd release). But that one is sort of tribute. So the last album I FEEL Chicago is Twenty One in 1991. Yeah indeed listening to XXX is like meeting a LONG LOST FRIEND.\n\nFEEL the first single from this album is static at first but from the mid section it turns dynamic. Reminding me of the Chicago during \"18\" album.\n\nKING OF MIGHT HAVE BEEN is tried-and-trued style of Chicago ballad during 80s. WHY CAN'T WE tries duet but unmistakably typical of Chicago styled ballad. Most surprising one is 90 DEGREES AND FREEZING. Just like Earth Wind and Fire and groovy and I hope Maroon 5 cover this one. So thrilling and my best song of the year so far.\n\nVerdict: My favorite band returns stronger than ever.\n\nRating: 95 out of 100. One of the finest comeback efforts.\n\nRecommended for: Wide range of pop rock fans.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Angels and Airwaves was a band that was created by former Blink 182 singer\/guitarist Tom Delonge and his ambition to create something truly different was very admirable. The band's debut CD, We Don't Need to Whisper, was a very good CD that unfortunately suffered from a bit of a slow pace and some weak lyrics. But still, it was a great start and I was very interested to see the band's follow up CD, I-Empire. I-Empire (called by Tom \"the \"part 2\" to We Don't Need to Whisper) is a much faster CD that's a lot more accessible and easier to like. The music on here is really uplifting, and it's perfect music for playing VERY loud, especially on a nice sound system or while driving fast in a car. It's definitely a much better CD than the 1st effort. That said, though, it still suffers from some of the flaws of We Don't Need to Whisper; the lyrics have not improved; in fact, they've gotten even a bit worse. I think Tom needs a new approach to his lyric writing for this band; I thought it was weird during their first CD that the music is this futuristic, very \"epic and different\" in style, and presented itself as a grandoise and epic masterpiece...yet the songs were about \"your best friend is not your girlfriend\" ...it didn't work. I-Empire's faster music fits its lyrics a lot better, but unfortunately, the lyrics on here are often extremely corny, and almost every single song's a love song. I really wish Tom would try to sing about something else, as his \"I love you, you make me feel alive\" lyrics really started to get old for me on this CD. Blink 182's self-titled final CD featured some excellent lyrics and the songs showed real variety in their subject matter; Angels and Airwaves is about love, that's it. Only a couple tracks on this CD seem to deviate from that. That aside, though, this CD shows much more variety in the songs and much more exciting music and it easily makes it a more fun listen.\n\nCall to Arms; 8\/10. A very cool start to the CD. Some nice lyrics and a catchy chorus. A good song.\n\nEverything's Magic; 7\/10. Another good song, a very fast-paced and fun song; the lead single. Features great music that sounds a bit like Blink 182's Anthem Part 2. The chorus isn't too great, though.\n\nBreathe; 8\/10; A very nice song musically. The first slow song on the CD yet it's not unbearably slow. It's a little repetative lyrically, (he says \"I love you\" over 16 times in it,) but it's a really nice and ambient song. Well-done.\n\nLove Like Rockets; 7\/10; Although the subject matter of the song's a little stupid when you think about it, it's a cool-sounding and \"different\" song with a pretty cool chorus. The song's got a cool space-like theme to it. The \"imagine\" line's pretty cool. Overall, it works. Has a cool, powerful ending, too.\n\nSirens; 7\/10; Took me a while to get used to this song, (the \"dadadadada\" lyrics got on my nerves at first,) but now it's actually pretty good. The whole song's very catchy and the verses are sung very well. Good lyrics, actually.\n\nSecret Crowds; 6\/10; This is more of a \"rock song,\" that sounds like it'd be perfectly played in a football stadium. It's not too bad lyrically, (providing the theme for the CD; \"If I had my own world, I'd build you an empire,\")and the verses are pretty nice, but there's unfortunately no hook here; the big refrain of the song doesn't have any sort of tune, it just features Tom singing slower and louder. It needed more of a tune or a hook. The band obviously disagrees, though, since this is currently the planned 2nd single.\n\nStar of Bethlehem; 7\/10; When Angels and Airwaves first played this song live, it was an epic, 6-minute plus song with a very long instrumental at the beginning with the lyrics eventually kicking in at about the 3-minute mark. For the CD, the song was wisely split up; most of the long instrumental takes place in this song, while the rest of the song kicks in on the next track, True Love. This is a pretty cool instrumental, both atmospheric and fast, as well as very memorable. Goes very well with the next song.\n\nTrue Love; 8\/10; Another great song, with a very fast chorus and featuring the continuing instrumental from the previous song. Lyrics are pretty cool. Another song that's definitely got more of a \"rock\" sound to it. Well-done.\n\nLifeline; 3\/10; Really irritating song, the only bad one on the CD. Tom's vocals on this song are horrible; he REALLY strains on it and it just sounds very forced and corny. Really bad lyrics, too. Easily the worst song on the 2 CD's. Musically it's pretty weak, too. The verses have a good tune but unfortunately Tom's strained vocals end up making the song pretty intolerable.\n\nJumping Rooftops; NA\/10; a cool little techno intermission as we transition into the powerful final tracks on the CD.\n\nRite of Spring; 8\/10; It's hard for me to give this an 8\/10 because the lyrics are really horrible; it's too bad because it's actually very good subject matter; Tom talking about his life, with a really cool chorus and verses; overall a very catchy and really impressive song musically, but the lyrics are pretty awful. Tom tries to rhyme to really bad results, and we end up with a song that tries to rhyme \"pass\" with \"cash\" and lines like \"it took about an hour to start a punk rock band, to offset my ****** up family land.\" Had he not tried to rhyme I think we would have ended up with a MUCH better song lyrically, but still, it's a great song and one of the most memorable on the CD.\n\nHeaven; 10\/10; An excellent end to I-Empire with the best lyrics on the CD. It starts by sampling distorted clips from past Angels and Airwaves songs, then speeds up. Very great musically, very good lyrically. Serves almost as a part 2 to the apocalyptic Valkyrie Missile from We Don't Need to Whisper and it's overall a cool closing to the story told on the band's first 2 CD's.\n\nAngels and Airwaves have greated a great \"part 2\" to their first CD that's both faster and more fun. Now that they've finished this story, though, I hope their next CD's something completely different entirely, especially in the lyrical department. I'd like to see this band sing about some different subjects at some point. Easily recommended for anyone who'se ever been a fan of Tom's work in the past of if you like this \"stadium rock\" genre.\n\nThat said, I have to end this review on a negative note. After listening to the recently released \"In Defense of the Genre\" CD by rock band Say Anything, I've gotta say that THIS is a band whose lyrics are real, whose lyrics are true to life and whose lyrics are layered and very deep, and whose lyrics really mean something to the band. Tom Delonge's lyrics for Angels and Airwaves, on the other hand, are so far removed from any type of reality and are so formulaic and so cliche'd that it gives his songs the depth of a shallow pool...it's like listening to the boy bands of the 1990's again....yeesh. He just seems unwilling (or unable) to stretch himself at all in this category and it was such a step down on this CD from Whisper, which was itself a step down from where Blink left off from on their excellent final CD. The lack of emotional weight on these songs and true hooks ended up making the CD fairly forgettable. I liked Rite of Spring a lot because despite its horrible lyrics, it was nice to hear Tom finally sing about something that was obviously real life. Despite these complaints, this gets a 4-star rating. It's a good CD and fans of Angels and Airwaves fans SHOULD definitely check it out. But don't expect it to remain in your CD players for long....It's more exciting than Whisper, but just not nearly as memorable. Here's hoping the band switches gears with their next CD.","classification":4,"fold":9}

The album finds the band taking their folk rock sound into a 70's AM pop direction.  There are tons of great hooks and a lushness littered throughout the album.  \"Calvary Captain\" employs a Chicago style white r&b sound in the best possible sense.  The sultry tongue in cheek ode to cunnilingus \"Philomena\" simply soars with a gorgeous orchestration.  \"Make You Better\" starts off with a subtle guitar riff and then explodes into a powerful blast of piano pounding and soaring vocals.  \"The Wrong Year\" is propelled by a sweet accordion fill and a jangly guitar.  \"Carolina Low\" has the dark and somber folk rock sound the band is known for and it is deep and rich. \"Anti-Summersong\" has a country fair vibe with fiddles and a harmonica break and \"Easy Come, Easy Go\" has a wickedly cool reverb guitar that punctuates the track.  \"Mistral\" floats in with an airy keyboard and piercing guitar.  \"12\/17\/12\" is an acoustic guitar and harmonica track that sounds like it would have fit in nicely on Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album.  The album closes out on a strong and uplifting note with the anthem like \"A Beginning Song\".","classification":4,"fold":9}

There was none of that on here. Even though Fefe (Felicia) can carry a tune, every song on here was dull and forgettable. This album was void of bass, funk, melody, rock, roll, attitude, and, most importantly, soul. It's just generic pop music masked as rock& roll with a lot of noisy guitars.

So far, I've listen to them on repeat for extended periods of time, one at a time, to get my feels.\n\nI believe Fatal Illusion was the first video (audio track) tease\/release.  I like it around the :58 mark when it gets past its fills (Ellefson's bass is sweet). So from there until the end, it is just killer and guttural.  It got me excited to see what Megadeth (this version) would put out.\n\nThe Threat is Real reminds me of old school Megadeth. It doesn't have the classic step-down like Peace Sells or So Far, So Good(1986.1988), but sounds like it could fit with Youthanasia (1994).\n\nTitle track, Dystopia, has an updated feel for Megadeth. This doesn't always prove to be a good thing, but I think they nailed this one.\n\nMegadeth is one of my all-time favorite bands.  I was 'with' them since Killing is My Business...but I'm not the biggest fan after Risk.  I did come back for Thirteen, though.

{"text":"* The following review appears on the main \"Red\" page as well but is a review of this version which includes the extra tracks available here on what is the Target Exclusive version *\n\nThere are going to be hundreds of reviews of this album out there (and yes, I'm old, I still call them albums) and I know I'm not in Taylor's main demographic audience. First off, I'm a guy. Second off I'm 42 years old and normally listen to things like Irish punk, The Beatles, Springsteen or some hard core country like Chris Knight. I love big band music whether it's Frank Sinatra or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. With all of that said, I adore Taylor and this new album \"Red.\"\n\nTaylor's songwriting is still in fine form here. The thing that always amazes me about her writing is that she's able to tell stories in her songs, she keeps it simple and more often than not finds one heck of a hook in the chorus. There is passion, there's energy and there is joy. Sure, there are so sad songs, but it seems to my that Taylor takes so much joy in making music that it's hard as a listener not to get caught up in that with her.\n\nAfter listening to the 16 tracks and the 6 bonus tracks available on some packages I have to say that Taylor's bonus tracks alone are better than what most artists are putting out as albums these days. The \"demo\" recordings of \"Treacherous,\" \"Red\" and \"State of Grace\" are excellent and polished works that are just a bit more stripped down than the versions that appear on the album. It's not really fair to call them demos, as when I hear that word I'm expecting below-par sound and performance. I think it's the mark of a good song if it can be done solo-acoustic (or at least very stripped down) and these three songs certainly hold up well.\n\nFor me the whole album is very solid, there are no songs on this disc that I'd skip when listening to it. There is a nice mix of slower ballads and hard hitting rock numbers. Make no mistake about it, Taylor Swift is a rock and roll star. She's setting the bar for what pop music is and doing a fine job of it. It's funny, while listening to \"Red\" and the big anthmatic numbers I couldn't help but think this is the modern day version of Phil Spector's wall of sound. Sure, there are a lot of synthesizers here, but Taylor has an uncanny ability to create a big sound that just envelops you, especially if you like to play your music as loud as I do.\n\nI think it's the fact that Taylor is such a good songwriter and maybe more importantly storyteller that makes her so accessible across so many different lines. It doesn't matter how old you are or what gender you are, Taylor's songs resonate. Even a song like \"22\" which is an anthem for the young \"let's go out and party\" crowd it still hits home with me at 42, because believe it or not kids I was 22 at one point. And, I'm guessing the 10 year olds that hear the song will relate to it because they know it's exactly what they're going to want to do when they're 22.\n\nRed is a little bit country, a lot of pop and a heavy dose of rock and roll. Like some big artists before her, Taylor Swift is not a follower, but instead she is creating the standard for what is popular music. And maybe this is the old man in me coming out, but where most of popular music is fairly brainless and devoid of substance that's the opposite of what Taylor Swift brings to the table. She brings some great story songs, most of which (if not all) I'm pretty sure are very auto-biographical. Taylor is simply telling us her story, she's just making it rhyme and adding some killer hooks and melodies for good measure.","classification":5,"fold":9}

I would say the highlight of the album though is the duet with K. Michelle Put It In. Bobby V may not be the BEST singer in the world and he doesn't try to be. Bobby V reminds me of Keith Sweat in the sense that he uses his voice to the best of it's capablities and never tries to be someone he's not.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Alright, take yourself to back in the day, before all the personal stuff, and when Britney ruled the music world with an iron poppy fist. Still not there? Oh well... This song, her last real song that anybody would pass more than a horrifying glance at her. And while not her best vocally, you just can't get away from that beat. Congrats, kudos, and bravo to the producer that created that, because it is simply amazing. Perfect for spy movies, and when it was used in \"Chuck,\" and it's just so darn catchy. You know the opening chords, you know the riff, it's all familiar, and lovable.\n\nAs for Britney herself? She's okay, normal dance club fare. Nothing special vocally here. Lyrics? It's Britney, b**ch! Who needs lyrics? Just a beat, and a music video!\n\nSo overall, you might want to skip the vocal version, and just get the instrumental version which I am just lovin' up on now. So hurry, get it, use it as a ringtone! Or use it next time you can't get the James Bond\/Mission Impossible Theme for your secret spy activities.\n\nBy the way, some great covers have been made of this song, and most of them come out surprising well. Some offer a different take, some are fun, some are strange to say the least. Hard-Fi did a great low-fi indie cover of the song, which all but removes the original melody, and just keeps the lyrics, while adding some car effects.\n\nNickel Creek did a great humorous live performance that you can find in various places. In that version, one of the band members readily admits, \"This song kicks a*s!\"\n\nAnd Yael Naim did a cover of the song, which is very strange and haunting. I didn't care for it, but some will and do.","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"A song that seems to fit no matter the year - timeless.\n\nTO AMAZON: Even though I didn't feel like saying anything else about this song and because you \"required' me to title my rating and \"required\" a minimum of 20 words in this description, I don't believe I shall rate ANYTHING ever again. Ratings are voluntary; they should not have ANY \"requirements\". Amazon has been where I buy my books, Kindle books, mp3's, camera accessories, and more for many, many years!!! I also paid for your MP3 Cloud (Premium) year subscription even though there are a lot of FREE cloud players. But if you continue barraging me with \"rate\" emails, I will leave and find another place to purchase what I want or even need. Additionally, since I now have a tablet, I didn't need my Kindle Fire anymore so I gave it away. Therefore, I don't even really need \"Kindle books\"; I can get ANY ebooks from anywhere. And I added all this in because of your \"requirements\". You weren't satisfied with my initial 11 words that were all I REALLY wanted to write.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I love the songs and music of Matthew West, and the song \"Day One\" is my favorite. It reminds me that today .....each day....is Day One of the rest of our lives. For me that is both a sobering and inspiring thought due to the fact, as we all know,  that our days on earth are numbered, and once the day has gone by it is gone, there is no way to go back and relive it or change it. Also we are not promised tomorrow. So this song reminds me to try to live each day to the fullest, to glorify the Lord who holds our times in His hand, and to live each day in such a way that I do not have to repent of ungodly actions or words that hurt my friends, family, or any human being that I come in contact with, in case I'm not here tomorrow to reflect and say I'm sorry. But on a positive note, the song also reminds me that yesterday is gone and it is Day one of the rest of my life so I can determine to make a new start and turn the tide of my life with God's help, so I can be a blessing to those around me and sow to the Spirit so I can reap goodness and blessings in my life and bring glory to Him who saved me. Glory to my Lord Jesus Christ who shed His blood upon the cross and conquered death so we could have eternal life and be cleansed by His blood of all our sins. This gift He offers to all who call upon His name.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Great song from 1985 used in the Rocky 4 movie. James Brown was a major force in American music since the 1950's. I don't believe James was given due credit as he sang to ethnic audiences. Whereas, say, Chuck Berry, sang to a white audience (Chuck was a genius. I don't know how he was able to relate\/sing to a white audience). James Brown is the \"God Father of Soul\". I miss you James, your enthusiasm and your talent. Listen to many black artists and they claim influence from James Brown. For example, the \"King of Pop\" Michael Jackson did many of James Brown dance moves. For some strange reason Amazon encoded this song at the bizarre rate of 247 kpbs. No matter, buy this song! Listen to the fade out at the end of the song. James sings \"I feel good\" as a reference to his 1965 popular song. Also, James's reference to \"Eddie Murphy eat your heart out\". This is in reference to SNL's Eddie Murphy's \"getting in the hot tub\" spoof of James Brown.","classification":5,"fold":9}

With their latest album, they've had to have a new decision of getting themselves recognized. So what they had was a bit of help from the caveman from Geico on their latest single, Let Me Be Myself. The song isn't a bad one, but when I saw the commercial for Geico, and even in their own video for the song. The song has got a bit of meaning, but when I saw the video for the song, I really turned my head away. I really never thought they would be in a music video for a song. The song is honestly though not a bad song for 3 Doors Down, but not as driven as was the case with Kryptonite was when they broke out awhile ago.

{"text":"When it has came down to Whitney Houston, there have been so many people who've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through, from her personal abuse, to her heartbroken marriage to Bobby Brown. Still, it sometimes can take a strong song to re-ignite a voice & spirit. That is absolutely the case with I Look To You, the title track off Whitney's 2009 album. The song is absolutely and intimately beautiful and sticks heart and soul brilliantly with the mood. When I first heard the song, it was shortly after Michael Jackson had died, and it just really brought me to tears unlike any other song I had heard at that time. R. Kelly wrote a definitive masterpiece for Whitney, and it really gave her a whole new light in a dark generation that is more into joke divas like Rihanna and Beyonce'. True beauty is suppose to be from the voice within, and in this era has been sadly forgotten about. I absolutely recommend this as a must for your music library, and feel the voice come alive. I don't know how Whitney will duplicate this song, but I'll keep looking for her when that comes around down the road. Definitively looking to Whitney.\n\nSong: A+\n\n2,500th Review!!!!!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":9}

Soft Cell, which has been labeled a one-hit wonder from the 80's, still has not been able to master having another smash song. But still which is a big surprise, their biggest song is actually a cover song from another artist. Tainted Love still sounds great today from the rhythm of the heart, to the mood that many songs don't ignite today. The song which is a cover of a old Gloria Jones song, still is a one of a kind joy to listen to. While it was cheaply sampled by Rihanna for her song S.O.S. in 2006, the song that Soft Cell made years ago, is still more than anything tainted, it is real love.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":9}

At first I didn't like the fake record noise which I hadn't noticed the several times I heard the song on the car radio, but even that's OK now.  Contrary to one reviewer, I love the bass!

{"text":"It's been about a year and a half since Disturbed went on their hiatus and now we get the first offering from frontman David Draiman's new band, Device. Being a longtime fan of Disturbed it was hard for me to go into this with an open mind, but after listening to it front to back numerous times part of me feels like Draiman is the one having trouble letting go of his Disturbed past. Device is classified as an Industrial Metal band, but there's a lot of similarities to be made between Device and Disturbed.\n\nI'm not going to spend the entire review breaking down these similarities because it wouldn't really serve any purpose. Those who have heard the album already know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, think of this as Disturbed, but with some heavier riffs. The album's intro, \"You Think You Know\", does a solid job of setting the tone for the overall album: enjoyable, but lacking in creativity. My only complaint with this song in particular is that the bridge on this song is very... lifeless. In fact, this is the only point in the album where I can use this term.\n\nOnce this song ends everything is going pretty smooth until we reach track four, \"Close My Eyes Forever\", which is a cover of the 1988 Lita Ford and Ozzy Osbourne duet. Now if there was one song on here that felt out of place it would be this one. I was never crazy about the original and I didn't find this cover to be much better. It's dull, it's boring, and it feels slightly misplaced after the album's single, \"Vilify\".\n\nAfter we get over that rough patch the album is pretty much more of the same from this point on. Take what you heard on the album's first three songs and that's what you're going to hear for the remaining 25 minutes. Which may be a good or a bad thing depending on the listener. Sonically the middle portion of the album is a little more experimental in comparison with the rest of the album, but it's still very easy to label majority of the album as a Disturbed clone, which was a little disappointing to me.\n\nOne of this album's biggest differences in comparison to Disturbed is its use of guests. You have Lzzy Hale assisting Draiman with the Lita Ford cover, and Serj Tankian, M. Shadows, and Glenn Hughes each lend their vocals to a few songs. Then Tom Morello and Geezer Butler both make an appearance as well. Serj sounds fantastic with Draiman on track five, \"Out of Line\", as does M. Shadows on track nine, \"Haze\". Glenn Hughes, on the other hand, did a less than spectacular job on the album's closer, \"Through It All\". I really could've seen this being way more powerful if Draiman had done it solo, but sadly that's not the case.\n\nOn top of the main album's ten songs there's a deluxe edition with two bonus songs and a Best Buy exclusive song as well. The deluxe edition contains a cover of Nine Inch Nail's \"Wish\" and a song called \"A Part of Me\". While the Best Buy exclusive is a song called \"Recover\". The Nine Inch Nails cover is a pretty unique take on the song, in a good way. It definitely sounds different when compared to the original, but it's enjoyable in its own right. The other two songs were enjoyable as well and I don't understand why they weren't on the main album. If you ask me I would've taken out the Lita Ford cover from the main album and put these three bonus songs onto the tracklist.\n\nStandout Songs: \"Vilify\", \"Out of Line (Feat. Serj Tankian & Geezer Butler)\" & \"Haze (Feat. M. Shadows)\"\n\nOverall Score: 7\/10 - The Device debut is an interesting one, but ultimately one that feels uninspired and unsure of itself. I think it might have been a good idea to play around with their sound a little more so they developed one that was more unique. Still, it's not terrible and it's not too far from the core Disturbed sound so fans will have an easy time adjusting. I look forward to hearing what they do with future projects.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304.\nI have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include \"Run 2 U\" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish \"Intuition\". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example.\nAnd when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. \"Becoming\" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with \"Haunted\". \"2 Find U\" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called \"Standing Still\" (or the second time, when it was called \"This Way\").\nAnother problem here is the lyrics. Songs like \"Fragile Heart\" and especially \"U & Me = Love\" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but \"Yes U Can\" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of \"Stand\"?\nI don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"It seems easy for people to critisize jewel for making such a big step when she seems to be on the right track with emotional ballads and sweet acoustic songs. Then why change? In my opinion a tallented musician should be able to combine different types of musical sounds, and be able to make a change in direction and still be in best form. To me jewel has done just that with this sassy peice of kwirky sophisticated pop. Each song on the album is a highlight with many different sounds. Intuition was the lead single with its accordian mixed with gentle pop\/r&b beats, there are signs of soft rock material with \"2 become 1\" and \"America\". Each song has its own identity, a very meaningful, simple song called \"fragile heart\" has the butterflies going with its gentle vocals and basic drum beat. This album is most definately in my top 5 albums of all time. The lyrics are very clever and much thought went into writing them, i would recommend anyone to read the lyrics whilst listenning for the first time. Well done to Jewel for creating uplifting songs in pop style with no sign of cheese but perfectly wrote upmarket, styled music!","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"Frankly, on the face of it Patsy Cline would not fall into my idea of a torch singer. That is, until you heard that voice coming out of the past to chill you to the marrow with her heart-rendering versions of some very classic country and crossover ballads. For those of us who came of age in the late 1950's or early 1960's this was the music at the high school dance where you got to ask that guy or girl that you had your eye on for that slow dance that gave you time to talk and feel out the situation. Thanks, Patsy. This volume contains so many classics it is hard to know where to begin but I counted at least 15 that you ABSOLUTELY need to listen to. That, my friends, rather says it all. Classic Hank Willaims tunes like Cheating Heart, Willie Nelson's Crazy, others like Why's He Not You and She's Got Him. Wow.

{"text":"The best of what redeemed the eighties from MTV crap. This was and still is a dense cacophony of beauty and your classic 80s angst and cynicism with moments of tentative redemption. Everyone's got their favorite 80s icons- they're probably mine because I got to see them in a small venue at the height of their powers, just after this had come out. Nothing burns into your teenage brain permanently like a great rock group when they're on top of their game, before they're just paying the bills and trying not to punch each other out in the process.\n\n\"She is Mine\" is a standout; Butler's seething rasp can have its oddly tender moments. (I still think he's one of the all-time sexiest vocalists- and I just die when he talk-sings \"Ha Ha Ha\". Classic Butler-ism.). While \"Pretty In Pink\" tends to give me the Mollyringwalds and it seems a bit sexist, I still love it for what it reminds me of: that great p-furs signature intro.\n\n\"Into you like a train\" is just full-speed searing beauty, guitars sweeping around you. And \"No Tears\" perfectly captures 80s wariness of political activism and the ensuing apathy \/antagonism with the problematic radicals of the day (\"There's demonstrations, and demonstrations.... you don't have a point of view. You don't have to say you do\".\n\nWhile occasionally Butler has his Dylan-ish moments of lyrical nonsense, they do work in their 80s way, like a collage of imagery and emotional impressions, not literal straightforward meanings in lyrics.\n\nIt has a  melodic, yet driving, layered noise. I could never go full atonal - the No Wave thing, so this has that kind of energy, in a sense, yet is tight and has a sense of tune you can remember, as opposed to just tuneless screeching. The layers & textures never get in the way of the lyrical\/melodic line- it always sounds like it's just short of all parts crashing together, yet it's sort of a controlled chaos that sweeps past you and around you. Also, this album has density without all the twinkly, trebly production that \"Forever Now\" has to make it more radio-friendly.\n\nPlus this just brings out the adolescent clove-smoker in me, when all this stuff seemed so romantic! \"So run Down\" is another great track- reminds me of that teenage time when even a bad hangover seemed like a new adventure!\n\nBetween the Furs & the Bunnymen, it was all shades and trenchcoats here on out...and that wasn't such as a bad thing at a tender age.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"When Faith No More disbanded in 1998, its members all pretty much hated each other. That sort of contempt seethes out of just about every single note played on the band's then-swan song, 1997's \"Album Of The Year\" (an effort that arguably benefited from all the inner turmoil). At the time of their breakup, the tide was truly turning, as bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit were beginning their short-lived domination of rock music and the alternative scene seemingly had no use for such a quirky band (Primus, another oddball act from the same era, experienced a similar problem). As the years went by, it became harder and harder to imagine we'd ever hear from Faith No More again. Thankfully, their legacy remained intact and as the legend grew with each passing year and desire for new music continued to swell, the band re-emerged (sans Jim Martin) in 2009 for a string of reunion shows, albeit without promise of new music being recorded. So when it was announced last year that the band would finally be releasing new music, it seemed that said album would be an instant lock for 2015's Album Of The Year.\n\nWell, the year isn't even half over, but with \"Sol Invictus,\" Faith No More have certainly crafted what will inevitably be one of the most exciting rock albums released this year. 18 years between albums has done little to squash the drive and creativity that is a hallmark of the Faith No More name. Not only does \"Sol Invictus\" stand head and shoulders with the finest rock music being produced today, it also sits comfortably alongside the band's already legendary repertoire. With Jon Hudson once again taking over on guitar from the elusive Jim Martin, the guys have somehow managed to re-ignite that spark the eluded them oh-so many years ago. \"Sol Invictus\" is crunchy, energetic, bold and adventurous.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's nice to hear Mike Patton singing again in this context. While the years have proven him to be a versatile artist who can't be nailed to one genre, Faith No More is his true home. And while he supposedly recorded his parts at home and in his pajamas, he sounds just as inspired to be here as the rest of the guys. The juggernaut rhythm section of Mike Bordin and Billy Gould throbs and pummels its way through the 10 sweet but brief tracks that make up the album, allowing room for Hudson to exercise some truly thrilling guitar heroics (echoing some classic moments from the Martin era without aping that style) and keyboardist Roddy Bottum to add just the right touch of class or weirdness, wherever either is needed.\n\nThe album opens with the title track, which finds carnival barker Mike Patton dipping into the water with ease before the band plows into \"Superhero,\" a glorious rocker that sounds like \"The Real Thing\" on steroids. \"Sunny Side Up,\" another track that plays to Patton's strengths, recalls the casual, almost sarcastic delivery that made \"Angel Dust\" such an odd and engrossing listen back in the day. By the time we reach \"Separation Anxiety,\" the band has had enough time to stretch its legs and really find its groove. Another rocker, this track allows each member of the band to shine, though Hudson finally earns his moment in the spotlight. A somewhat divisive track, \"M*****F*****\" finds Bottum on top, taking over lead vocals for one of the album's weirdest diversions. When this song was released as a tease last year, it didn't really set the world on fire. In the context of the rest of the album and with enough room to grow, it becomes one of the band's most intriguing tracks.\n\nAll told, \"Sol Invictus\" clocks in at just under 40 minutes. It's an efficient and thrilling knockout of an album. Few bands come back from the dead and make music that is relevant to the times while fitting into their past, but Faith No More have knocked this one out of the park (and then some). In a world where everyone from Pixies and The Replacements to Coal Chamber is putting out new music after so many years of silence and against all odds, Faith No More have become superheroes of a certain type. \"Sol Invictus\" will not only quench your thirst for new Faith No More, but it will also rock your face off in unapologetic fashion. Proving once again that there is no age limit in rock n' roll, Faith No More have more than rewarded our faith in them.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"In the Wake,\" a metaphor for life, is pianist\/composer Ann Sweeten's ninth album (plus two Italian compilations). Co-produced by Will Ackerman (who plays guitar on two tracks) and recorded at Ackerman's Imaginary Road Studios, the album features several acoustic instrumentalists on strings, flute, oboe, and English horn. Sweeten's graceful touch and fluid playing style are beautifully expressed on a Steinway baby grand (model B), and the sound quality of the music is flawless. Often tinged with melancholy, Sweeten's compositions have a dreamy quality that encourages the listener to kick back and just listen for a while, becoming immersed in the music and soothed by the gentle waves of sound. Ann Sweeten draws from vast life experience in the arts with her acting, singing, and dancing in addition to her music. She is also a staunch environmentalist, animal activist, and vegetarian. With so many means of self-expression available to her, it is no wonder that her music communicates so effortlessly.\n\n\"In the Wake\" begins with \"Was It Yesterday?\" a nostalgic ballad for piano, guitar, and flute (Trisha Craig). Wistful and dreamy, the gentle flow of the three instruments sets a mood of calm repose and reflection. \"Falling Leaves\" becomes even more soothing and relaxed, and Akane Setiawan's English horn adds the perfect counterpoint to Sweeten's graceful piano. \"Metamorphosis\" weaves a series of musical themes together to create a lovely tapestry that tells a story of change and inter-relatedness. Sometimes flowing and almost harp-like, sometimes quite rhythmic, and sometimes quiet and still, it is a very effective piece. \"Love Remembered\" is an introspective daydream with a passionate undercurrent. Andrew Eng on violin and viola enhances the poignance of this piece. As the title suggests, \"A Chance for Goodbye\" is deeply emotional and sad, and Liz Ehrman's cello is the perfect accompaniment to the piano. \"On Wings of Light\" feels lighter and more optimistic, and Setiawan's English horn keeps the piece soaring to new heights. \"Out of Embers,\" Ackerman's second appearance, is a favorite. Exquisitely gentle and dreamy, it seems to tell of hope and renewal - beautiful! My favorite track on this album is the more classical \"October Sky,\" a passionate and bittersweet piece for piano and viola that would be an amazing tear-jerker in a movie soundtrack. \"Now and Again\" closes the album much as it began - wistful and peaceful. Cello and oboe make this a gorgeous, heartfelt trio that leaves the listener feeling refreshed and renewed.\n\n\"In the Wake\" is sure to be another chart-topper for Ann Sweeten! Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

I love the simplicity of a song like \"The Clock\".

The MP3 samples on Amazon give you a good idea of what to expect, though they don't really do the songs justice. There is a good mix of very good and decent songs, with only one or two clunkers, but taste is subjective and what I like and dislike, you might not. I think it is great to have the whole band back together again and their recaptured (though slightly modernized) sound is proof that even after the so-so albums of the 90s and 00s, they can recapture the magic that made them special.\n\nWho is this album not for? Well, I don't think it'll win over many first-time listeners. Not that it isn't good, but it does have a retro sound I don't see getting much airplay these days.

This was featured on \"Annoying Orange,\" on the first episode of the series on Nickelodeon.\nI liked this song when it came out, but it seems like radio stations don't say the title of the songs they play often enough, so I never figured out what the song was called. All I could remember were the lyrics, \"wobble baby wobble baby wobble baby wobble (yeah).\" Searching \"wobble baby yeah\" on Google pulled up 2 songs, but I couldn't figure out which one was which. Eventually I forgot about the song, until I heard it awhile later on \"Annoying Orange.\" So I waited til the end credits to see what the song was, and could only find a high quality recording of this song on Amazon and iTunes. I go for Amazon because they don't have stupid DRM-protected songs. It's not the dirty version, but I guess that's better for my brother who watches \"Annoying Orange.\"\nThis song has a great beat and is very catchy. No deep lyrical meanings, but very catchy.","classification":4,"fold":9}

All five so far have been all mixed from the multi-tracks by Steven Wilson with the approval of the band. The set is being released in two versions, either 3CDs and a Blu-ray disc or 2CDs and 2DVD-As. The  first two CDs contain a new stereo mix of the original album and two \"Dance Of The Dawn\" versions, the third \"Blu-Ray set only\" CD has an \"alternate version\" of the album, and 5 single edits. The alternate album is composed of the studio run-throughs of \"Dance Of The Dawn\" and \"Giants Under The Sun\" originally released on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/the-2003-Rhino-remastered-2CD-set\/dp\/B00007LTIA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the 2003 Rhino remastered 2CD set<\/a>, an unreleased run-through of \"High The Memory,\" and a live version (Zurich, April 1974) of \"Ritual.\" A 2016 mix of the extended \"Dance Of The Dawn\" from the Rhino set is included as well. The first DVD-A contains the new stereo mix of the four original album tracks plus the extended \"Dance Of The Dawn\" in High Definition. The second DVD-A contains the same mixed for 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Sound, along with a flat transfer of the original album from the master tape source. The Blu-Ray disc retains the content of both DVD-As along with a plethora of extras, including the \"alternate\" album version, the five single edits, new stereo instrumental mixes of the album tracks and extended \"Dance Of The Dawn\" in DTS-HD Master Audio, and two \"needle-drop\" vinyl transfers; from the original UK LP pressing and the US banded promo LP pressing. Whew...!\n\nTALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, the group's sixth studio album, is considered by many the most controversial of the YES canon. Coming off the mega-selling CLOSE TO THE EDGE (#3US, #4UK), which featured just three tracks, including the side-long title cut, the band was blindsided by the departure of drummer Bill Bruford. Although an extremely gifted and popular member, Bruford was tired of the personal conflicts and the constant state of friction between him, singer Jon Anderson and bassist Chris Squire. When scouted by&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/KING-CRIMSON\/dp\/B00065MDSG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">KING CRIMSON<\/a>&nbsp;honcho Robert Fripp, who was putting together a new version of the titular groundbreaking progressive group, Bruford quickly bailed. With a world tour on the horizon, the band settled on Alan White, mostly known for his work with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/PLASTIC-ONO-BAND\/dp\/B000002UT9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PLASTIC ONO BAND<\/a>&nbsp;and on John Lennon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/IMAGINE\/dp\/B003Y8YXFS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">IMAGINE<\/a>, who had three-days to rehearse (!) before the tour commenced (most of the content of the band's next release, the live&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/YESSONGS\/dp\/B000002J1Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">YESSONGS<\/a>&nbsp;were recorded on said tour). During a stop in Tokyo during the tour, Jon Anderson was inspired to write a four-part epic based on a lengthy footnote within the book '<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Autobiography-Of-A-Yogi\/dp\/0876120796\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Autobiography Of A Yogi<\/a>' that described four \"shastras\" or treatises covering all aspects of religious and social life. Anderson approach guitarist Steve Howe with his idea, and when Howe agreed they began working on themes and instrumentation, conceiving the project as four side-long album tracks. Unfortunately keyboardist Rick Wakeman disagreed with the concept and musical direction, but agreed to finish the material, even though he considered it too avant-garde, bloated and padded. The songs were credited to Anderson and Howe, with music by YES. TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS  was the first YES album to utilize 24-track recording, although they had numerous issues with the equipment. Wakeman found himself often bored and spent a lot of time in a nearby pub playing darts. He also contributed to BLACK SABBATH's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/SABBATH-BLOODY-SABBATH\/dp\/B000002KET\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH<\/a>&nbsp;which was being recorded in an adjacent studio. A tour followed where the group performed the entire album live, which I'm proud to say I caught twice. Afterwards, Wakeman was the next to jump ship, onto a fairly successful solo career, rejoining YES on and off throughout the remaining years. Although panned by many critics, who held the album as an example of progressive-rock excess, it was a stunning commercial success. It was the first UK album to \"ship gold,\" and topped their charts for two weeks, in the US it made #6 and also certified gold (over 500,000 copies sold). The band toured behind the album from November 1973 to April 1974. The band also broke attendance records at the UK's Rainbow Theatre, selling out five consecutive nights, a rock band first.....\n\nThe set comes in two mini vinyl replica gatefold sleeves within a slipcase, at first the cover art looks the same on both, but on closer inspection the second has a subtle difference (I'll leave it for you to discover). The disc labels reproduce the record labels found in the original 2LP set, in both the original (Discs 1 & 2) and \"tweaked\" (Discs 3 & 4) versions. The booklet features new sleeve notes by Sid Smith along with portions of new interviews with Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Alan White. Besides rare photos and archive material the original artwork has been expanded, restored and approved by long-time YES illustrator Roger Dean. My only complaint is the lack of easily readable lyrics. Either an expanded booklet, a separate lyric booklet, or a mini-poster of the original (and beautiful) inner jacket is sorely needed. As is you need a magnifying glass or your old LP to follow the lyrics, which are a major part of this masterwork, and enjoy the now minuscule inner artwork........\n\nTo quote Steven Wilson: \"I worked on and off for about 3 years on this new mix in my quest to do it justice. I hope it will satisfy the people who agree with me that it may just be Yes's pre-eminent masterpiece.\"\n\nAs with RELAYER, another dense recording, the added surround, center and subwoofer channels open the compositions wider, helping the listener to discern parts and themes buried in the conventional two-channel mix-down. I wish they had included a surround version of the instrumental mixes found on the Blu-ray, although the listener can again discern more from the absence of vocals, a 5.1 mix would've been the icing on an already delicious platter. Mirroring their genesis, all the tracks are credited lyrically to Anderson\/Howe, adding Squire to \"The Ancient \/ Giants Under The Sun.\" The music is credited to the entire band as well as the track \"The Remembering \/ High The Memory.\" Anderson and Howe felt TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS to be innovative and breaking new ground, whereas the critics let loose, some calling it the death-knell of progressive rock. . It's arguable that the architect of the album's sound-palate this go-round is Howe, who's playing throughout is stellar. Even though he has spoken bout his distaste of the opus, Rick Wakeman devised many unique and daring keyboard passages, providing the \"glue\" so to say, that binds of the disparate parts. One of the pluses of Steven Wilson's remix is the liberation of Chris Squire's bass, which seemed lost most of the time in the original mix. Surprisingly the MVP award goes to the new kid, drummer Alan White. To be thrown into the maelstrom of a mega-popular band's tour on three days notice while facing the prospect of contributing and recording four side-long compositions must've seemed daunting indeed! White not only acquits himself with a rock-solid steady base underlying the music, he also contributed melodies, a bridge and piano on \"Ritual.\" His finest moment however is leading the band during the astounding \"Ritual\" percussion break, the rarest of rock animals, a drum\/percussion solo that's not boring. The two outtakes of \"Dance Of The Dawn,\" basically live in the studio run-throughs, are terrific as well, and best exemplify the talent, genius and innate musicality of the band called YES......\n\nAll said, the remastering is stellar, the remix will depend on individual tastes. As with his remix of RELAYER, Wilson brings forth many passages, sounds and nuances buried in the original mix. Is it better? Well, while the 2003 Rhino remaster was great, hearing this prog monster in surround sound is a whole other ballgame. Wilson's remixes\/re-imaginings are always well done, you never sit there and think \"gee, this sounds lousy\" unless your a dyed-in-the-original-listened-to-it-2,000-times advocate for the original recording, which is also here as a \"flat transfer from the original tape source\" as well as needle-drops from the original UK LP and US Promo LP (the latter two Blu-Ray only).  I look on these YES remixes as a complimentary additions to the original recordings. Considering the length of TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS and the breadth of extra material you would have to spend many, many hours listening to and comparing the different versions to note the exact differences. I say, take it on it's own merits, and enjoy! Fans will definitely be pleased, and those either new to the album or critical in the past will have to judge it's merits. Me? Well anyone who has read my review of FRAGILE will note that I was disappointed that TALES was not the next release after RELAYER. You'll have to excuse me, I'm dying for a second\/third\/fourth listen......\n\nTRACK LIST:\nNew Stereo Mixes:\nCD 1:\n1. The Revealing Science Of God (Dance Of The Dawn) 20:18\n2.

YES eventually chose Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz, late of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/REFUGEE\/dp\/B0043A0UW6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">REFUGEE<\/a>, as his replacement and released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/RELAYER\/dp\/B00NAYYSS8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">RELAYER<\/a>, another successful (#5US, #4UK) a three-track but this round single-disc album. After they toured THAT album, the individual members all recorded solo albums, with Moraz  eventually escaping the dreaded psychological pressures of being a YES member. He later was off to a dozen-year stint with THE MOODY BLUES, only to be replaced by...Rick Wakeman! The reunited TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS band recorded two albums, the back-to-basics&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/GOING-FOR-THE-ONE\/dp\/B00007LTIC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GOING FOR THE ONE<\/a>&nbsp;(which is rumored next in line for the Steven Wilson magic ears remix) and the disappointing&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/TORMATO\/dp\/B00009Z574\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TORMATO<\/a>.

{"text":"This was probably the smost unexpected hit album of 1999 *maybe tied with Santana.* Cher hadn't had a gold album or decent hit single since 1991 and the \"Love Hurts\" album along with the top 20 hit \"Love and Understanding.\" She had some minor success with the \"It's A Man's World\" album in 1996, but unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere. Then in 1998, Cher released her dance\/pop masterpiece \"Believe\" and it became a worldwide smash. Here in the US, the single became her 4th solo #1 hit and was the #1 single of 1999. The album \"Believe\" was a smash too hitting the top 5 on the album charts and going 4x platinum.\nOf course, the star of the album is the title track. The song is perfection, plain and simple. However, the hidden gem is \"All Or Nothing.\" Although it was a club hit, this song should've been huge. It's a great dance track and has a great chorus. \"Strong Enough\" was a moderate hit for Cher also and has a great disco sound to it. \"Runaway\" is a good listen too along with \"Taxi Taxi.\" \"Love Is the Groove\" is cool too but it's a bit repititive. Ending the album is a remix of her 80's hit \"We All Sleep Alone.\" It's nothing special and I enjoy the original more.\nCher really proved once again that she had staying power. She closed the 90's with a bang. What other performer out there can brag about having massive hit singles in every decade since the 60's?","classification":4,"fold":9}

She released her nineteenth album entitled simply, CHER. This album is her second album with this title, the first being released in 1966, with such songs as \"Alfie\", and \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". This album brought Cher back onto the charts, with three chart-topping singles. This album is beyond amazing and displays Cher's experiements with an excellent combo of Rock & Pop music.\n\nI FOUND SOMEONE\n  The first single from the album. This song was originally recorded by Laura Branigan back in 1986. Laura's version was the more than less popular version, reaching #90 on the charts. But Cher had given us the ultimate definitive version. Even though Laura Branigan had recorded this before Cher, this song, to me, is Cher's song. It's a classic song that only Cher can do.\n\nWE ALL SLEEP ALONE\n  The second single from the album. Another amazing song. This is another song that displays Cher's amazing voice and great 80s image.\n\nBANG BANG (MY BABY SHOT ME DOWN) (1987 Version)\n  The third single from the album. Back in 1966, when Cher had released her second album entitled, THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER, she had recorded this classic tune, which was written by Sonny Bono, himself. The song was released as a single then and was a huge hit, later being covered by Frank Sinatra. Well, just 21 years after recording the original, Cher decided to re-record the song into an 80s Metal version and release it as a single. This is another huge successful song and I love it.\n\nMAIN MAN\n  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome ballad.\n\nGIVE OUR LOVE A FIGHTIN' CHANCE\n  Everybody would love to Give Their Love A Fightin' Chance. Most men or women are to blind to see that. This song is for anybody who would seem to prefer not to give their partners a fighting chance.\n\nPERFECTION\n  I love this song, because: No. 1) It is definitely an awesome song, and No. 2) It fits me to a tee. I'm a perfectionist and everything has to be of my satisfaction. You'll also notice that the refrain sung in the very beginning is sung by DARLENE LOVE & BONNIE TYLER.\n\nDANGEROUS TIMES\n  The 80s were Dangerous Times, but we need to realize that it is now the year 2005, (2006 or 2007, depending on when you read this review), and it is far much worse than it was in the 80s. Listen to this song and be careful with how you live your lives out there in the real world because it isn't easy.\n\nSKIN DEEP\n  Not bad.\n\nWORKING GIRL\n  Awesome.\n\nHARD ENOUGH GETTING OVER\n  I believe that if you had just broken up with your boyfriend or girlfriend, it will be very hard to get over, depending how much in love you were with that person. So, if there is anyone out there who has dumped or has been dumped by your girlfriend of boyfriend, just remember that it is hard to get over that fact, but the pain does go away. While you are waiting for that pain to disappear, let Cher help you by listening to this amazing song.\n\n  This album definitely defines 80s image Cher and it should be owned by every Cher fan. NO EXCUSES! If you don't have a copy already, than you are wasting time. So, get up off your a**es and buy a copy of this incredible album from Cher.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Adele (born Adele Laurie Blue Adkins on May 5, 1988) really turned out some song with \"Rolling in the Deep!\" Although the lyrics explore a woman's feelings after a love affair ended unhappily, the melody is remarkably catchy and even a bit upbeat especially when Adele sings the words \"we could have had it all.\" The music fits in perfectly with Adele's vocals and makes \"Rolling in the Deep\" one of the best tunes I've heard in a while.\n\nAdele's voice, as always, is flawless; I love her contralto sound and she never lets go of a superfluous note! There are some backup vocals but Adele doesn't really need them even though they do sound pretty good--Adele easily carries this song on her own. I highly recommend this song for anyone just getting into Adele and people who appreciate moving and unforgettable pop music.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This is a two CD live album with a whopping 30 tracks that cover all facets of Taylor's career up to the early 90's.  Backed by a 9 piece band the album really showcases the versatility that a Taylor live show encompasses.  When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of, but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music.  Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of his stuff, and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks.  All the big hits are here along with some of Taylor's better album cuts.  For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song \"Milworker\" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album.  The song is one of the best he has ever written and for anyone who has ever worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like.  I don't have any of Taylor's studio albums so for me this collection is a great overview of the many facets of Taylor's output.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Back when I worked in the classical music section of a record store, I'd occasionally have a customer who asked if we carried  \"a recording of this or that opera...but only the music.\" Translation: apparently, the singing in an opera isn't music! Only the instrumental parts are \"the music!\"\n\nThis particular download is a mostly successful collection of \"operetta without voices.\" Don't let the track listings fool you, there are no singers featured here - the tracks are instrumental only (as in, \"only the music\"). The downside to this is that most of the arias & set pieces featured are limited to one verse, with the \"sans singer\" tune being artfully tossed around and covered by various instruments. The upside is twofold: 1. we're not subjected to potentially awful singing by a bunch of no-name singers, and 2. it allows the listener to sing along without having to compete with another vocalist.\n\nThe performances are generally middle-of-the-road. By that I mean that the performances aren't overly straight-laced while they're also not as stylish as they could have been. There are a few imprecise moments here and there, but nothing so bad that you'll feel you were robbed by the $.99 price. Recorded sound is surprisingly good, and that may be enough for most listeners attracted to this kind of compilation.\n\nThe repertoire selection is really quite good and broad, though 95% is drawn from the German repertoire. It's nice to have a couple of Suppe overtures included (\"Light Cavalry\" and \"Poet & Peasant\"), overtures that were written for operettas that have long ago disappeared from the repertoire but that survive as very popular light classical concert pieces. The collection features a good selection of pieces from Suppe's operetta \"The Beautiful Galatea.\"\n\nThe Overture to \"The Gypsy Baron\" takes a detour about halfway through and segues to something else (perhaps it's a version of the overture I'm not familiar with), and in general, the exoticism is missing in all of the Gypsy Baron tracks here featured. Likewise, the selections from \"Die Fledermaus\" are shorn of the schlag und swung one expects from an echt-Viennese performance. I heard a couple of \"CD clicks\" in \"The Merry Widow\" selections, but otherwise, no technical problems to report. For the price, it's hard to complain.\n\nOverall, this is a nice collection that should appeal on different levels to amateur and aficionado alike.\n\nRecommended.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Vocally, Kroeger fits the song, and Santana plays some awesome riffs that keep you moving, and the song afloat.

{"text":"It seems that The Cure is making a comeback in the form of all these new acts that sound old.  You can thrust Washed Out in that equation.  It's interesting that they chose such a name for their group, considering the fact that their musical direction leaves them sounding a bit, well, washed out.  It's not that I can't appreciate this breed of music; it's just that the synth heavy beat becomes rather stagnant over the running time because there is no real change in the musicality.  It just remains redundant from start to finish.  I would have liked some swells here and there to differentiate key moments in the song.  Instead, `Amor Fati' seems to go nowhere.  I'm sure there will be some who really enjoy this, and I will admit that in parts this song (and apparently this group) shines.  Vocally, I see a lot of potential, but the flow of the song itself is so monotone that the vocals take on a similar shading.  And yet, despite my apparent dissatisfaction with this particular song, I ultimately hear something that has me intrigued and wanting to hear more.  I know, strange right?  Well, I am interested in hearing more from them to see how well rounded they are as a group.  If the balance of their album is in this same vein then I'll be staying far away, but if they can use their talented parts to create something a little more unique and interesting than I can see them becoming something I thoroughly enjoy.\n\nSo, I personally kind of hate this song but I am interested in hearing what else this group can do.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"When you think of classic musical acts, there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the Piano Man, Billy Joel. It has nearly been 40 years since he released his debut album, and his songs past and present have stood the test of time in a incredible way. While it has honestly been more than a decade since he made his final studio album, 1993's River Of Dreams, he still holds his own beautifully by delivering the strong songs that have been staples of great music. With the new success of his music being recognized with his documentary, The Last Play At Shea, focusing in on his music as well as being showcased as the final act to perform at the former home of the New York Mets, and being the first to deliver a rock concert at Yankee Stadium back in 1990. Now set to celebrate his 40th anniversay, a new new hits collection is out there to re-introduce Billy Joel's classics to a new era.\n\nBilly Joel - The Hits is a single disc retrospective of Billy Joel's big hits on one album. While the songs have all been remastered nicely, it honestly is a collection of great to a younger era of those who've never owned a Billy Joel album before. Still, the collection does deliver nearly all of his big hits including The River Of Dreams, the #1 hit We Didn't Start The Fire, his signature staple Piano Man, and the intimate New York State Of Mind, and Big Shot. While the collection of songs stands well on a single disc, there are so many of Billy's biggest songs that sadly weren't here. The biggest shocker is his standout song Uptown Girl, as well as favorites like the Grammy-winning Just The Way You Are, Don't Ask Me Why as well as many others. It honestly is also a surprise that a standout like The Downeaster Alexa wasn't here, in place of one of Billy's lesser-known hits like Everybody Loves You Now. That simply is the biggest fluke of the record.\n\nAll in all, despite a lot of Billy Joel's great classics not being recognized, Billy Joel - The Hits isn't definitive from what has made him the Piano Man to sing us the songs tonight. It honestly isn't as definitive as was the case with Billy's better hits collections like The Essential Billy Joel (2001,) or his distinctive Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II which sold over 21 million copies in America alone, and remains the highest-selling greatest hits record by a solo artist. I honestly can't recommend this hits collection for the ultimate Billy Joel fan, but a noble sampler for anyone whom has yet to hear a ode from the Piano Man. What makes Billy Joel? It honestly wasn't everything here.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C+\n\nPrice: C+\n\nRemastering: B\n\nOverall: C+","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"I don't get this band or this album. They possess none of the swagger, anger or danger that makes the best punk bands interesting. Rather they started fairly slick and have gotten progressively more commercial with every album since 1988, mining the same limited song writing style to the point where they are musically indistinguishable from any number of vapid pop\/punk bands polluting the world today. The lyrics may address more than the usual boy\/girl pop nonsense but so what? There's nothing new, emotionally cathartic, or of genuine musical interest in any song on the cd, just lots of LA studio perfection and showbiz professionalism. These guys display little imagination, and no real heart, I'm afraid all that's left is workmanlike and bland craft: the Toto of punk rock.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"If, like me, you owned the original Crimson & Clover LP you were one of the few to have the original long play version of the title track.  It plumb eluded me for decades, having the single version on various artist records and CD's and recently replacing my few vinyl albums with the ESSENTIALS collection from Rhino, very well remastered.  But I still missed the long album version and finally, easy as pie!  Download the version digitally and you have a remastered terrific sounding copy to take you back to 1968!  Now I'm considering buying the rest of the album just for nostalgia, you can burn your own CD this way (I've done it with quite a few hard to find items now and Amazon gets total kudos from me in that department).  This song and this version is a national treasure of the psychedelic 60's and if you are only familiar with the single version from radio days, try this out, it's a buck and a quarter well spent.  The relaxing almost Hawaiian guitar instrumentals that caress you up to the wah-wah'd processed vocals at the end are a beautiful side trip from the cut and edited single version.","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"Even though I had most of these albums I was still excited for this set and the result is even better than I could have imagined. Like others have stated before, this is like hearing the records for the first time. The clarity and diversity on albums like Greetings, The River and especially Nebraska are stunning. I'm hearing instruments and production touches that I never knew were there, all with clear sound that's turned up without being over-compressed. The dynamic range is incredible and the interplay between instruments is thrilling to hear. I never noticed what a lush album The Wild, The Innocent & the E Street Shuffle is until now, nor did the full power of Darkness on the Edge of Town grip me until listening to this edition. Tracks like \"Born to Run\", \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\", \"Reason to Believe\" and \"Something in the Night\" have never sounded better. Add to that the restored packaging and you have a set that's well worth double dipping on. After this arrived I sold my old copies; this is the only set I need in terms of Bruce's first seven releases.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that Tunnel of Love wasn't included. It's my favorite Springsteen album and it would have been a nice way to round out the first two decades, yet that's a minor gripe and I'm more than happy to wait until Volume 2. In the meantime this is a stellar set and it's right up there with remasters from the likes of U2 and The Smiths in terms of quality and value. For newcomers or dedicated fans this is absolutely worth the purchase.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Seal returns with his ninth studio album and it is an excellent collection of eclectic songs that continues to show his amazing vocal style and mature songwriting. Produced by Seal and the amazing Trevor Horn (Jeff Beck and Billy Idol), this album sounds warm and and evokes a relaxed feeling whilst throwing in a few upbeat dance tracks to liven things up. Seal is joined by a number of successful songwriters including Stephan Moccio (Miley Cyrus) and Justin Parker (Lana Del Rey) to help create these emotionally cathartic songs. The entire album flows well and is really strong but highlights include the signature vocal harmonies of album opener \"Daylight Saving\", the soaring chorus and Beatles-influenced ending of \"Every Time I'm With You\", the electro rock groove of \"Padded Cell\", the classic sounding production of \"Do You Ever\", the funky disco feel of \"Monascow\", the smooth piano ballad \"The Big Love Has Died\", and the sentimental lyrical poetry of \"Half A Heart\". Despite the fact that Seal's last three studio albums were a little hit and miss, Seven is a very strong return to form which coincides with his relationship breakup and his reunion with Trevor Horn as producer. Seven is highly recommended to anyone who likes mature and soulful pop songwriting.","classification":5,"fold":9}

This is probably due to the fact that the band is just too good for the average radio listener.  This album may change that because it is, without a doubt, the group's most commercially-accessible release.\n\nThe songs on this set run the gamut from the group's trademark ballads to tunes that make you want to get on the dance floor.  Front man Stokely Williams has never sounded better and he is especially in fine form on \"Not My Daddy,\" the duet with guest Kelly Price, \"Caught My Eye,\" the title cut, \"Unsung,\" and the thought-provoking \"Twenty Years Later.\"  The Latin-influenced \"Bossalude\" really showcases the group's versatility and should attract a new audience of Condition fans.\n\nHowever, those tracks are equally matched by the other nine powerful selections, providing a listening experience that is destined to satisfied long time followers and \"newbies\" alike.\n\nFor a group that has been around for twenty years, the members of Mint Condition sound as fresh as they did when they burst on the scene with such early 90's hits \"Breaking My Heart(Pretty Brown Eyes)\" and \"U Send Me Swinging.\"","classification":5,"fold":9}

Sadly, the last several songs she had put out like #Beautiful and the lackluster Triumphant from 2012 have been less than stellar in regards to voice and absolute spirit. Sadly, with the songs she has came out with from her upcoming album The Art Of Letting Go, they just haven't added up in regards to voice and spirit in what Mariah had been known for. Her latest song You're Mine Eternal is not one of Mariah's better songs, and feels weak in her voice and soul in what a love song can really be. The song alone is not really anything worth raving about, but remixed with Trey Songz on the song, feels worse in voice and spirit. As for Trey Songz, he has had better collaboration with other divas like Toni Braxton a few years ago with Yesterday which was more sensual and delivered better in the mood.

{"text":"I really didn't become a big Ke$ha fan until the tail-end of her \"Cannibal\" period, but at that point I fell hard for the all-out fun music that Ke$ha brings. After what seems like forever, Ke$ha finally released her 3rd album (not counting the remix album) in December, 2012.\n\n\"Warrior\" (12 tracks plus 4 bonus trakccs; 59 min.) starts off with a brooding title track, and then jumps into the lead-off single \"Die Young\", an infectuous song and one of the better tracks on here. 2nd single \"C'mon\" is alright, but a curious choice for a single as there are quite a few better songs on here. Such as 3rd single \"Crazy Kids\", another highlihg on the album. \"Dirty Love\" features Iggy Pop, not that you would notice as such as I can't hear him at all on it. Supernatural\" is another upbeat track. The album closer \"Love Into the Light\" is a fantastic send-up\/trobute to Phils Collins' \"In The Air Tonight\" and a great way to close out the album. The \"deluxe edition\" comes with 4 bonus songs, most of which are great: \"Last Goodbye\" is a touching break-up song, \"Gold Trans Am\" is as sure fire Joan Jett as anything Jett has done herself, and \"Out Alive\" is a massive dance tune and the very best song on this entire album. \"Past Lives\" is unnecessary.\n\nIn all this is quite the album. The more you play, the more you will like it. But to see it live is better yet: I Ke$ha just played here in Cincinnati this past weekend at the Shoe, and Ke$ha and her band and dancers put on a non-stop gigantic dance party, it was so much fun. She played a ton from \"Warrior\" (9 songs, including \"Supernatural\" for the first time ever, she announced), along with the greatest hits from Animal\/Cannibal. If you have a chance to see her in concert, do not miss it! Meanwhile \"Warrior\" is definitely worth checking out.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Not the album I expected from Bob Dylan, but, after all, why not?  Bob has worn so many hats in his career and has resolutely refused to be pinned down with a label.  Now his voice is in the kind of shape where an album like this makes sense, and the only question is: is Bob going to respect the tradition out of which it comes -- the Sinatra concept album of the 1950's -- or is he going to subject it to some deconstruction?  Well, he plays it straight, and the frayed and hoarse quality of parts of his voice are put to nice expressive use on a well-chosen selection of songs of loss: loss of love, loss of energy, loss of hope.  Just as with Sinatra's albums, the sense of a guy in a club with a small-group band behind him (I know: Sinatra had Nelson Riddle!) is palpable, and the songs are put over with feeling that at times rises to eloquence. That's especially true of \"Where Are You,\" a song I hadn't heard before, that Dylan brings to a quite harrowing conclusion.  Of the songs in this album that one might have thought Dylan would have tried earlier is \"Lucky Old Sun,\" a song about there being no rest from labor in this world.  It gets a fine performance here.  I also think he does a good job with \"Some Enchanted Evening,\" a song less about loss than the fear of loss.  It surprised me how readily this song, which I had tended to think of as a bass aria requiring a Pinza, a Tozzi, or a Sam Ramey, took to being turned into a Sinatra-style bluesy ballad.  I had read a generally positive review of this album that marked \"Some Enchanted Evening\" as one Bob should have avoided.  I don't agree -- to my ears it comes across just fine.  The test case for me on the album was \"Autumn Leaves\" -- Sinatra's and Tony Bennett's versions are in my ear.  Again, Bob did it justice by pretty much letting it speak for itself.  For my money, there isn't a bad track, and the work of the accompanists deserves mention, especially Donny Herron on the pedal steel and Dylan Hart and Joseph Meyer on the French horn.\n\nWe're long past the stage where a recording had to strive to be \"definitive\"  -- it's relatively easy to get stuff out, from studio or live performance, and we're now in the healthier position of just accepting an album as a record of a performance.  (This has been especially healthy for classical music).  Dylan has aways been a performer -- what he commits to disc can turn up in odd forms in performance or on future discs.  Nothing is set in stone.  Take this as a performance -- it's one I would be happy to have heard live in some small club or other -- and I think you would be taking it in the right spirit.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I loved Mumford and Sons first album.  I only somewhat liked their second album despite it surprisingly winning Album of the Year.  I never really cared much more for the band.  In fact I didn't even care to watch their music videos so I actually forgot what they even looked like.  When the band announced that they would be going 'electric' I was excited.  I said I loved their first album, but I would take synths and electric guitars over banjos any day.  So my first thought was that they were going to follow in the steps of Arcade Fire who went into disco indie rock territory with the post Album of the Year album Reflektor.  The lead single \"Believe\" was released and my hopes for a Mumford Reflektor went out the window.  I loved the song but it didn't seem worth the hype.  They also released \"The Wolf\" which was also a decent song but far from their claims of real 'electric'.  I didn't discount the album yet though.  I wanted to know for sure what the band considered electric.  So the album finally came out and I decided to preview it a few times on Spotify before considering buying the actual CD.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  I listened to it through 5 times and it just didn't click.  They went sorta electric, but somehow they got even more boring.  Some of the hooks in the songs are catchy but very forgettable.  The lyrics are so cheesy and cringe worthy most of the time.  The only decent songs that save this from getting a 1 star rating from me are 'Believe', 'The Wolf'', 'Hot Gates', 'Only Love' and 'Snake Eyes'.  But even those songs are forgettable aside from the lead single.  Also note that only one of those songs isn't a single.  I really don't remember any of the hooks.  I said some of them were catchy, but I can't sing a note of any of the songs if you paid me to.  The so called electric guitar riffs were so bland.  This will sound hipster, but its also true, the band has become generic and boring.  This isn't them experimenting.  This is them preparing for their downfall.  Not all bands have everlasting success.  I predict this will be the beginning of the fading of Mumford.  This album might do well in its first weeks on sale but it will fall off quick.  The band needs to really concentrate if they wanna get up from this slump.  I can see some people enjoying and even loving this album, but that doesn't mean its good.  I see more people hating it.  I tried to like it and not be part of the group, but its hard when the album really is as bad as people say.  If you're a hardcore fan of the band, then I don't know what to tell you.  You could gamble a few bucks on this album, but I suggest you listen to it online first and see if you like it first.  Like I said, some people will love it, but more people will hate it.  Proceed into this album with caution, especially if you're a fan of good music.","classification":2,"fold":9}

He owns his role in the band with gusto, But the real star here is keyboardist Don Airey. Airey's clever arrangements show his confidence and flair. While Ian Gillan doesn't have the durability in his upper range that he used to, the vocalist hardly needs it here. His tone is still strong at age 67, and his ability to compete with Airey and Morse remains undiminished.

{"text":"While many would love to white-wash the history of alternative rock titans The Pixies (or simply Pixies, if you'd like to be obtuse), the reality is that they have always been a band taken for granted in their own time, whose works have always been appreciated much more in retrospect than upon release. Take \"Bossanova\" and \"Trompe Le Monde\" for example. The former being the follow-up to the iconic classic, \"Doolittle,\" and the latter being the band's farewell album (before re-uniting a decade later). Both were more or less discarded by the band's fanbase at the time of their release, but here in 2014, they don't sound so bad and you'd be hard pressed to find a fan who will speak ill of them. It is with this mindset that we dive into the band's latest offering, \"Indie Cindy,\" 20+ years in the making, mind you...\n\nSo first things first, let's get a few things out of the way. \"Indie Cindy\" is the first collection of material recorded by the band after the exit of the very lovely and very crucial Kim Deal, who held her own not only on the four-string, but on the absolutely essential background vocals. And that stinks. Big time. But you wouldn't turn your nose at a decent Frank Black solo album, would you? Let alone one that happened to feature the talents of guitarist Joey Santiago and drummer David Lovering? Yeah, that's what I thought. Also, I say \"collection of material\" as opposed to album because this is really a compilation of the three EPs the band had previously released, re-arranged to fit together into something resembling an album. Is it always cohesive? No, but darn it, the songs are good, really!\n\nTo help soften the blow of Deal's exit and the recycled nature of the album, \"Indie Cindy\" was recorded with producer Gil Norton, who served as the man behind the curtain for \"Doolittle\" and everything after. So we have that working in our favor. And since this is 2014, you can bet that these songs are big and bombastic. In a word: Gigantic. While there are some questionable lyrical passages from the blackest of Franks (\"I'm the burgermeister of purgatory\" Really?), sonically, these songs are rock solid. \"Bag Boy,\" the first track released from the newly revamped line-up and featuring some dude named Jeremy (?) in place on Deal, starts off with an electronic intro before giving way to an insane hook delivered by admittedly silly lyrics. Without thinking too hard, this one track alone justifies the existence of a three-piece Pixies.\n\nGranted, there are moments where the album would have really benefited from the presence of Deal (or any lady, for that matter). One can't help but feel like the middling \"Blue Eyed Hexe\" could benefit from a female perspective, while would-be classic \"Another Toe In The Ocean\" can't help but feel incomplete. The band do their best to pull together in an attempt to make up for missing chemistry, and it's in this spirit that the thumping opener \"What Goes Boom\" and the breezy closer \"Jaime Bravo\" are born. Even at its worst, \"Indie Cindy\" feels a bit like what modern rock radio would sound like today if the Pixies never went away (and, subsequently, if Kurt Cobain were still alive today). In that spirit, \"Indie Cindy\" truly delivers.\n\nMake no mistake: \"Chinese Democracy\" this ain't. But if you're expecting another \"Surfer Rosa\" or \"Doolittle,\" you are out of luck. Perhaps 20 years from now and with enough hindsight \"Indie Cindy\" will find its audience. But in the meantime, take it for what it is. For a 3\/4 Pixies album, it's about as good as it gets, and who knows if we'll ever get another one.","classification":4,"fold":9}

I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life, given the right production and management.\n\nThis band has finally, (under Jay DeMarcus production) with XXX, come into their own. Of note, checking the Rascall Flatts website, DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences.  It shows on this production.\n\nThe STRONG voices of Lamm, Champlin and Scheff, with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams, and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera's departure, breaking new ground for the band.  Instrumentally, the bands already strong skills are supplanted by  some of Nashville's best hired guns on guitar and drums.\n\nStylistically, they cover Trip-Hop-Pop, Power Ballads, Power Pop, New Country, Jazz Fusion, and Blues Rock.  This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays' music scene.\n\n\"Love Will Come Back\" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit. Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists\n\n\"Caroline\" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem. Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists.\n\n\"King of Might Have Been\" is another stand-out, Scheff power ballad.\n\n\"Feel\", the first single, has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene, with its updated beat and production values.\n\n\"90 Degrees and Freezing\" is a Lamm Jazz-Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60's and early 70's. Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this, too complex and tight for AAA, too hip and edgy for AC.\n\nOther material is very good, not just \"filler\" but it's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay.\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners.  No corners were cut on this production, and Warner\/Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it.  Just hope they can break them back into the spotlight.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"There are some songs that can really deliver from their simplicity at the soul. But these days it can be very hard to hear what they are, largely because the radio play has been less than stellar. For Ed Sheeran, he has delivered nicely with some great simplistic songs that have worked well for him before like Lego House and The A-Team. But when it has came down to his X album, he did have a few lagging song that didn't work as well at the core like Sing and Don't which borrowed more from his hip hop influences. He did much better with Thinking Out Loud, because it really was a good song. Photograph is another great song. I think it is his deepest song from the X album. Not only because the song is very good, it is a song that is better than the joke artists of music today, that have been more wasted, and not tapped into their deepest core and just became a novelty like Beyonce' or Rihanna.

This album is billed as a \"country\" album, but, as other reviews have mentioned, don't be put off by that, because it's not the homogenous sludge that's passed off as country music these days, but rather wonderful songs with some country instrumentation and with lots of well-known and good country singers (and some guy named Jagger) singing along. The song with Martina McBride is worth the cost of the album alone, because she sings this one, rather than screams, and she has a great voice, and the lyrics are moving. Most of the songs mention aging or the aging process, but the lyrics are intelligent and interesting and the production is great and not overdone. If you like the Eagles or Henley's other solo albums, you need to buy this one.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Would it be able to live up to its namesake? The original focused on roots country and a touch of gospel, delivering a classic equal to the legacy of CCR. (Creedence fans unfamiliar with that album will be exhilarated to discover that priceless little gem tucked away in Fogerty's catalog.)\n\nThis new release brings the timeline up to, more or less, the seventies, where Fogerty pays tribute to many of his favorites. Right off the bat, if you're just looking for a couple downloads, he knocks \"Haunted House\" right out of the park. In looking at the song titles I thought it might be the old Loretta Lynn weeper but this is the Jumpin' Gene Simmons song that appears on so many Halloween compilations. The audio sample doesn't do this justice; it belongs in Fogerty's top tier right next to covers like \"I Put A Spell On You\".\n\nSo many others could be selected for individual download. A quick guideline for sampling first might include \"Paradise\", \"I Don't Care\", \"I'll Be There\", \"Fallin' Fallin' Fallin'\" and the ominous Fogerty original, \"Change In The Weather\". I wasn't a big fan of John Denver's quavering voice so Fogerty's rendition of \"Back Home Again\" really, so to speak, brings this one home for me.\n\n\"Moody River\" is one of those late 50's - early 60's death songs that were so prevalent back then. Pat Boone has been unfairly maligned as time has passed since he wasn't rock and roll, but by old school pop standards he was an impressive vocalist. Fogerty makes the song grittier than the original but this particular death song has a peppy hook similar to Brook Benton's \"Boll Weevil Song\" that just subverts the darker edges of this song.\n\nStylistically the Blue Ridge Rangers span the gap between rock and 1960's era country. If you haven't picked up a John Fogerty album since&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Centerfield\/dp\/B002KOOHCQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Centerfield<\/a>&nbsp;and the song samples pass your taste test I'd recommend the album as a whole rather than just select downloads.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"November 30th, 2010\n\n1. Holdin' You Down (Going In Circles) - An anthem-like song that features a bit of heartbreak. We've all heard said song this summer\/fall. A-\n\n2. Ten Seconds - A nice song about wanting a guy to get out of your face because he broke your heart. Nice production. B-\n\n3. Good Enough - This track is amazing and has grown on me immensely. It's kind of emotional and gets you right in the heart. A\n\n4. Don't Make Me Wait - A fun, playful 80's-sounding song. Catchy and grows on you. B+\n\n5. Love You Long Time - My man Salaam Remi who produced and co-wrote the excellent \"Lions, Tigers & Bears\" got all over this track too. Obviously the best song on the album, it has an upbeat demeanor and feels like a love letter sent to one *REALLY* lucky guy. Sorta like Mariah's \"I'll Be Lovin' You Long Time\" in subject matter, but just think better song. Hot marching drum sounds. A+\n\n6. Redemption - A track kinda like \"Call Me Guilty\" from 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Fearless\/dp\/B001CJOHG6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fearless<\/a>&nbsp;but even darker. Has a hip-hop beat and the gospel-inspired chorus is a real highlight. A-\n\n7. Excuse Me - I love the feel to this one because it really, really sounds old-school vocally and production-wise. A true standout. B+\n\n8. U Get On My Nerves (Feat. Ne-Yo) - A cool duet idea between two relatively new artists. Not the strongest track here but has an extremely addictive albeit simple piano arrangement that will get stuck in your head if you pay attention. B+\n\n9. Stuttering - The repetitive nature of the chorus can get annoying, but probably not overly so. Still a great track. Nice and simple piano riff fills the air. B+\n\n10. Famous - I see this song's point especially vocally, but I didn't love it on initial listen because it's also repetitive. But what strikes me now and caused me to change the grade from a \"C+\" is because of its strong, emotional tone. B-\n\n11. Luv Back - \"Luv Back\" features sort of an island\/reggae sound in production and a happy vibe even though it's essentially a break-up song. It will have you singing along. A+\n\n12. In Vain (iTunes Pre-order track) - This track took a long, long time to grow on me. At first it doesn't really seem like it goes anywhere so those of you who didn't get it, it's all good. It's good, but not great. Anthony Bell did a KILLER, \"A\" effort song on the debut called \"In Love With Another Man\" with Jazmine and this song is no comparison. B- (not available for sale anywhere now).\n\n**********************\n\nSo may I start with the cover art? Can you say fierce? I freakin' love it! It makes me think of the older days with the leather jacket, boots and the classic model car.\n\nAnyway, this is an excellent album like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Fearless\/dp\/B001CJOHG6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fearless<\/a>. And although I didn't think it surpassed it in quality at first, it definitely has now. It has a slew of excellent songs and absolutely no average or dreadful songs to be found here. The producers also worked the tracks out here especially \"Excuse Me\", \"U Get On My Nerves\" and \"Good Enough\" which happens to have the best intro on the album.\n\nI love this woman!! Her voice! Her choice in genre! Her lyrics! I will buy her next album and support her because that's what I do: support artists I really enjoy that put in hard work AND make superb albums. Any of you who are slightly disheartened by any negative reviews, don't be: you will love this album. I'm sure of it.\n\nI hope you guys liked my review and I'm so glad I was one of the first to put it up. Jazmine Sullivan's music is close to my heart because she's so honest like myself and she's just fun to listen to. Oh, and did I mention THAT VOICE?

{"text":"I love Passion Pit to death. Michael Angeleko's introspective, at times depressing, song writing that mixed with catchy fun production always brought a weird dichotomy, but it works. I loved Manners and Gossamer when they were originally released, and new music from Passion Pit is always welcomed. Over the past 3 years, the group (I shouldn't called this a group) has gone through some noticeable changes. The original band members have since dispersed leaving Michael Angeleko as the front and face of Passion Pit for this album. Michael Angeleko's bipolar disorder has effected him so much that tours for the last album were cancelled and a long hiatus from music soon followed. \"Kindred\" is a wonderful album from beginning to end, and brevity is what keeps this album in focus. 10 tracks, all less then 5 minutes. However, what keeps this album from being a 5 star album for me is the lack of truly standout tracks. I also felt like Kindred was a slightly less ambitious project. The album had that signature Passion Pit sound that I absolutely love, but lacked some of the experimentalism that previous albums had. Still, this is one of my favorite albums of 2015 thus far, and anybody that loves fun upbeat music should definitely check this out.\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Where the Sky Hangs\n2) Five Foot Ten (I)\n3) All I Want\n4) Whole Life Story\n5) Dancing on the Grave","classification":4,"fold":9}

Now on to the music - initially when I heard his first single, LOVE CALLS, I thought it was Al Jarreau but as the song went on I realized that it was a new artist named Kem. The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably, KEM!!\n\nI love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs, namely: LOVE CALLS, MATTER OF TIME, SAY & YOU ARE.\nYes, it is more of a \"chill out\" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production.  I'd highly recommend this disc to lovers of r&b mixed with subtle jazz notes - it's a great debut from a real artist who I hope to hear much more from in the future (despite his sorry label and lack of promotion).","classification":5,"fold":9}

Like hard rock is at the soft end of my spectrum and on the other end metal, be it Thrash like Megadeth or NWOBHM bands like Judas Priest. However I listen on occasion to Jazz, Blues, Industrial bands like NIN or White Zombie and somewhere in that screwed up mixture I discovered Primus about 5 years ago and bought their entire discography. I'm a fan of anything and everything Claypool. Sean Lennon is a new artist for me and only know of his fathers work. Well, they seem to be a great collaboration! My vinyl collection is only around 100 reissues all bought new, but is ever growing and expanding as I have caught the dreaded vinyl bug.\n\nI was drawn to this album because of well, any 2LP set at under $20 catches my eye, especially colored vinyl, and especially including Claypool. So with that knowledge only, I youtubed the entire album while on the treadmill and immediately knew this album was special and deserved shelf space in my mancave. I thought this will be great when I need a break from the screaming I've come accustomed to, and the trippy atmospheric elements were pure ear candy. I could not buy this album fast enough and of course served up on my main vinyl rig via Senn HD598 kicked things up about 10 notches over the youtubed treadmill session. Really beautiful, and full of relevant lyrics.\n\nA word about quality control (vinyl). What have I got to do to get an album that's not warped, drilled centered and trimmed neatly around the edge??? Thank God I've got a vinyl flat in my future... I even had side-A come with a weird visible coating of like a frosted film over the entire record. Dead quiet recording though and man oh man what a powerful clear sound this album has.\n\nIn closing, my highest recommendation. It really made a nice addition to my collection and if you haven't heard it yet?","classification":5,"fold":9}

Unfortunately, his latest set of songs with Paul McCartney, on Four Five Seconds with Rihanna and One Love, were songs that sincerely weren't his best songs. But with so much of his career, being more focused on being Mr. Kim Kardashian than being a strong rap artist, he just doesn't seem to drive his heart into his work. Kanye's song, All Day isn't exactly a strong rap song, but taking out things on others. He sincerely doesn't put his all in the category genius to his work, and instead takes it back a little too far to his earlier works. He had much better song several years ago, and instead his song lately have been wasted from the heart.

However, I also confess that I have to credit finding out the name of the band who performed this song via a metropolitan Washington D.C. area classic rock station as that song was being played and the DJ gave informative details about this song. I enjoy this song as it seems to have an encouraging message of seeing the glass half full in life and because of the creative metaphor of describing rock n roll being given to everyone metaphorically speaking. For whatever reason the metaphor reminds me of something connected of just having fun in life and seeing the humor in life when feasible.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Kansas was my first taste of progressive rock in the early 80s - a blend of heavy guitars, keyboards, and melodic vocals - set to complex melodies and soul-searching lyrics.  Songs like Play the Game Tonight, Hold On, and Fight Fire With Fire set a high watermark for a new generation of musicians.  John Elefante provided the vocals for those Kansas classics.  He continues his musical journey with his latest, release, On My Way to the Sun.\n\nThe first thing listeners will notice is the classic sound that catapulted Kansas into the national spotlight over thirty years ago. Strong and melodic vocals dominate the album.  The production is first-rate, the kind of work that Elefante fans have grown accustomed to.  The arrangements are tight and sound is current - really a mix of the present and the past.\n\nThe title cut, On My Way to the Sun tracks a pilgrim who learns hard lessons and ultimately comes to the end of himself: \"Lately, life's been good to me\/I finally found the key to what it's all about\/This is a life that's been truly turned around\/And this is no make believe.\"\n\nThis is How the Story Goes is an 11 minute progressive tune that is reminiscent of Kansas; a true feast for the ears. Elefante is quick to alert listeners about the most important thing in life, namely - one's eternal destiny: \"And this is how the story goes\/You must believe it all my friends from the beginning to the end\/Cause everyone lives forever\/We just have to choose where my friend.\"  As the tune progresses, the answer is given for people desperate for hope: \"A Virgin had a Son\/And a stone was rolled away\/So how can we be terminal because He lives today.\"  Kansas fans will swear that Kerry Livgren and Dave Hope joined Elefante for this one!\n\nWe All Fall Short is a brilliant acoustic driven tune that awakens listeners to this fundamental reality, namely, every person has committed cosmic treason against a holy God, and has as a result, fallen short of His glory:  \"But we all fall short of the glory of the Lord\/And if we stand on the fence it's not a life we can afford\/No better place to be than beneath His wings\/And the love that we crave is the love that He brings.\"\n\nThis Time is a haunting, cello dominated tune that follows a girl who gets pregnant outside of wedlock and is pressured to walk through the  horrific prospect of having an abortion.  The song is a powerful reminder that life is a gift from God - that life is meant to be cherished and treasured.  A very special song, indeed.\n\nConfess is a gospel-exalting song that celebrates the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ and the forgiveness He offers every person who confess their transgressions: \"Praise Him and fall to your knees and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord\/And He'll be faithful to forgive you of your sin\/Just confess that Jesus is Lord.\"\n\nMy hope is that John Elefante's new work will attract a whole new audience.  This is masterful music that honors God and lifts the cross of Christ high!  Play it loud and worship with a heart that magnifies and exalts the King of the universe!  baldreformer.wordpress.com","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"There are just so many songs from the movies that the great Whitney Houston had made so dominant, and a force that has still not been displayed in magic since the 90's. It is unfortunately that there aren't many good songs that were made from films these days. What she had really accomplished from her work in The Bodyguard, The Preacher's Wife and Waiting To Exhale, really captures the essence that really isn't felt in music and film anymore. Her songs from Waiting To Exhale might have been fewer than The Bodyguard & The Preacher's Wife, but they are still a joy to listen to. Count On Me, Whitney Houston's duet with gospel great Cece Winans is actually one of those comfort songs that really stays with you at the soul. It is one of my favorite songs Whitney recorded in her lifetime, and it still says a lot more joy at the down to Earth connection she had made in the voice. Cece really also complimented Whitney so nicely, from the inner visions as well. They had remarkable chemistry together. This is one download I sincerely recommend you own.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"If you only know Billy Currington from \"Party For Two,\" his hit duet with Shania Twain, you need to expand your horizons and check out his 2003 self-titled debut and this latest gem, which reveal what Currington is really capable of vocally and stylistically.\n\nDOIN' SOMETHIN' RIGHT opens and closes with foot stompers (\"I Wanna Be A Hillbilly,\" \"She Knows What To Do With A Saturday Night\") which will have you dancing in the streets (or at least at your local honkytonk).  It between, we get a somewhat gentler Billy, with the title track\/lead off single providing a relaxed yet heartfelt delivery, and a lusty \"Little Bit Lonely\" plus \"Here I Am\" showcasing incredible charisma.\n\n\"Good Directions\" is the type of down home, good ol' boy number that Kenny Chesney succeeds with (again and again and again).  Billy's remake of \"Lucille\" is a nice update, hitting a little harder than Kenny Rogers' original, while a collaboration with Michael McDonald on \"She's Got A Way With Me\" offers a power ballad change of pace.\n\nHopefully, this diverse collection will elevate Billy to the next level on the country music food chain.  It's a fine effort that clearly avoids the sophomore jinx.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Katy has definitely lost her talent in her voice, as she tries to make her own version of the Sara Bareilles song Brave.

{"text":"I think this is a great set. It contains a lot of my favorite McCartney tracks, and it also includes many that I didn't have before I got it. Paul has been the most prolific ex-Beatle by far --- of course, two of the Fab Four are sadly no longer among us --- and has put out tons of stuff over the past several decades, so even a set this size  inevitably isn't going to please everybody, as a lot of people are bound to have too many favorite tracks that weren't included (and to dislike too many of the tracks that are here).\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is the best McCartney comp to be put out so far. The CDs come packaged inside a book containing an opening \"note\" from Paul --- though no notes on Paul's musical history or any stories behind the songs --- as well as track credits (the names of the people who played, produced, etc.) and a lot of photos of Paul. The photos are cool (although they aren't in color), but I find it a bit odd that, despite the fact that the set spans Paul's entire career, none of the photos include any members of his group Wings --- in fact, that group name is never  mentioned anywhere, except on Paul's shirt in one of the photos. Not even Linda is pictured anywhere. Of course, though, the photos have absolutely naught to do with the music, which is what really matters!\nLike I said, this set won't please everybody, but I think it's terrific, especially since it isn't super-expensive!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I remember when \"Night Visions\" first came out.  Imagine Dragons was virtually unknown.  I purchased the album the day it came out partially as an impulse buy and partially because of the sleeper hit song \"It's Time\".  The album had a familiar yet unique catchy sound that I really enjoyed.  They aren't in my top 10 favorite artists, but I thoroughly liked them immediately.  Then the song 'Radioactive' became one of the biggest hits of 2013 and propelled the band into super stardom.  I digged the song, but I honestly never really loved it like most.  Mostly because it just didn't fit the style of the majority of the other songs.  Some other bands even rode along with the success of the band with similar sounds such as American Authors.  There were also the detractors.  People who labeled the band the next \"Nickelback\" in a negative way.  Needless to say, I was anxious for their next move.  Their second album would decide whether the band was a fluke or in for the long run.  Finally they released their lead single for their second disc.  \"I Bet My Life\" had the same sound as many of the songs from NV but with a slight soulful backdrop.  I enjoyed it nonetheless.  They released another song titled \"Gold\" which I was disappointed in initially because of its electronic sound trying to emulate \"Radioactive\" but just sounding much less memorable.  I was starting to not feel that interested in buying the new album in fear of it having too much of the electronic 'Radioactive' ripoff sound.  Before I spoke too soon they released yet another song which was said to be the official second single \"Shots\".  The title suggests party shots, but the songs lyrics turned out to be so deeply beautiful and infectiously delivered in a dance rock manner that I was excited again for Smoke and Mirrors.  Well when the album finally arrived I was actually feeling questionable about buying it again, partially due to the long wait for it.  I wasn't the only one apparently since the Best Buy didn't even bother to take the album out of the storage yet on its release day until I asked about it.  But I still bought it, like Night Visions, as an impulse buy.  I read many mixed critics reviews feeling like I had wasted money before I even listened to it.  I'm glad I can say that most critics are dead wrong about the album.  Sure it's not the most amazing thing ever, but it's still a good modern album that I'm positive many will come to love.  Here is my track by track review.\n\n1.  Shots:  This is a great dance rock track.  I'm sure this will be a hit at clubs and parties.  The lyrics aren't happy or sad.  They are somewhat gloomy in a nice way.  The guitars are nice.  There are the typical Imagine Dragon chants throughout but the slower delivery of some of the verses are the best for me.  The chorus will pull on your heart strings and make you wanna get up and dance.  Add this to your workout playlist.  Great start to the album.  9.5\/10\n2.  Gold:  I said earlier I was initially disappointed with this song when it was first released.  But I've grown to like it.  Still not among my favorites though.  I do like the whistle hook.  The lyrics do have some good meaning.  The chorus wasn't my favorite either but it still manages to get stuck in my head.  The guitar toward the end is a highlight.  Not a great song but not bad at all.  8\/10\n3.  Smoke and Mirrors:  The song starts off slow and gentle like 'Demons' before exploding into a somewhat unexplosive catchy chorus.  The final two minutes were a nice surprising and soothing ending to the track.  This song will get better and better with repeated listens.  The guitar solo is really nice!  Something you haven't heard from this band.  Gives it a classic rock feel with modern touches!  9\/10.\n4.  I'm So Sorry:  People have compared this track musically to The Black Keys.  Its hard to deny it because if you played this song to me I wouldn't guess it was Imagine Dragons, but it is.  But then again, whose to say what sounds like ID and what doesn't this early in their career.  It's a nice rocking song.  The bridge part with what sounds like female background vocals is the best part.  This is the type of song you'd hear in a action movie trailer.  Another workout playlist worthy song.  8.5\/10\n5.  I Bet My Life:  This song didn't hit big leading up to the albums release.  Well not by ID standards.  But it's grown on me so much I'm surprised it hasn't become such a mega hit yet.  I'm confident that this song will have longevity to become a big hit, as \"Radioactive\" didn't hit big until long after it's initial release.  The chorus is impossible not to have on replay in your head.  The soulful background mixed with folk guitar and a rocking chorus are the recipe for a great rock anthem!  Very personal lyrics for Dan but also very universal at the same time.  Great song that sounds even better among the rest of the album.  9.5\/10\n6.  Polaroid:  This is a nice playful song with a nice melody throughout.  There's a hip hop feel to the delivery of the verses.  There are also nice 'doo doo doo' moments throughout and group vocals.  People seem to look down on constant \"whoahhh\"s in songs nowadays but this song uses them well.  The soulful bridge section till the end sounds like something from a Hozier track.  Some have said this song is a filler but I like it.  Just a nice feelgood song.  9\/10\n7.  Friction:  There are nice Middle Eastern style guitars in this one you don't hear often in music nowadays.  Brings back memories of System of a Down.  The yelled vocals almost remind me of Michael Jacksons vocal delivery.  This is a rocker.  It changes tempo throughout nicely.  Another addition to your gym routine as well.  9\/10\n8.  It Comes Back To You:  This song has a great guitar hook thats similar to U2, more specifically their song \"When I Look At The World\".  Thats meant as a compliment.  Immediately this is a candidate for hit single.  Probably the catchiest song on the album!  I just love this song.  The vocals.  The guitars.  The 90s laid back drums.  The production.  I hope they release this as a single.  I hope it doesn't become this albums \"Amsterdam\", the best track from their debut that wasn't released as a single.  You won't get this out of your head!  10\/10\n9.  Dream:  Leave it to this band to follow a great song with another great song.  This is a hauntingly beautiful ballad.  The chorus is just delivered in a heartbreakingly gorgeous manner.  Their are string instrument moments that just add to the beauty.  An instant classic.  10\/10\n10.  Trouble:  This sounds like it was Bruce Springsteen inspired and I like it.  It doesn't fit well with the rest of the tracks stylistically, but it's still good.  Its a really fun and uplifting song.  Not the best, but still nice.  8.5\/10\n11.  Summer:  The title says it all.  This is a great summer track.  It's another dance-rock track with a nice eerie effect in the hook.  It really does feel like a song to listen to while driving through a summer sunset.  I didn't think the chorus was special at first but like many great ones it grew on me soon after.  The guitars are nice as always too.  9\/10\n12.  Hopeless Opus:  The verses are hip hop tinted and playful like in 'Polaroid'.  I think someone else also said this and I agree, that this sounds like a male version of Lorde in the chorus.  Guitar solo is a highlight of course.  This is just another decent feelgood song.  Nothing wrong with that.  8.5\/10\n13.  The Fall:  The moment this song opened I knew I was in for a great closer to the album!  This is the perfect song to end the album like a credits song.  There's something tragic yet uplifting about the music and lyrics and vocal delivery that works so well.  This is a progressive pop rock song.  It also has a beautiful cinematic feel as it builds to its climax.  I'm glad this track lasts the entire 6 plus minutes.  It's a very gorgeous ending that leaves you wanting more. 10\/10\n\nSo this album left me wondering what was going on in most of the critics heads who gave scathing negative reviews for this album.  They seem to hate catchy stadium music in a biased manner.  I would take this over some of the trash some critics hail as great albums.  This isn't the next 'Nickelback'(which is a horrible comparison), this is Imagine Dragons and they have made another classic pop rock album.  I might even say it's better as a whole than Night Visions.  Night Visions had at least 4 tracks I would skip.  If you liked their first album, you will definitely more than enjoy this album.  It's another different yet familiar sound for the band.  If you aren't even a fan of the band and just like good music then this is recommended.  Sure its not the best album of all time.  But it's not trying to be.  It's trying to be an accessible album with great hooks and fun melodies with some dark moments sprinkled around.  I'm not saying all critics are wrong.  But in the case with this album and plenty of others, they did get it wrong.  We all have opinions, but to trash this album the way some have is just unbelievable.  I went into this disc expecting something horrible based on critic reviews and I was surprised at how much I loved it.  This isn't a sophomore slump, well unless it ends up bombing in sales, which I doubt will happen.  I'm not forcing anyone to buy this album, but if you like good music and are willing to pay for it, then this is the album for you.  Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Though I have owned this set for a while, and have been enjoying it tremendously, I decided to post this note after purchasing and listening to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-99-Most-Essential-Bach-Masterpieces-Full-Works-Edition\/dp\/B006CQQTSS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Most Essential Bach Masterpieces (Full Works Edition)<\/a>.  It's a great set for those who want to listen to the complete works as the composer intended.  This set includes some of the same works, including complete works, and is a better value.  It has about 1 hour less of music but is about half as much.\n\nThis collection features many performances by the Bach Collegium Japan and Masaaki Suzuki, while in the full works collection they are only represented in the Cantata (BWV 147) and the Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major (BWV 1068).  Also duplicated are the 5 tracks that make up the performance by Conrad von der Goltz of Partita Number 2, while the other set does not include the 6 tracks devoted to Nobuko Imai's rendition of Partita Number 3.\n\nThis set also contains a number of works present in the other set but by different performers.  Orchestral Suite Number 2 in B Minor (BWV 1067) is performed here by the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble and Penelope Evison, while the Masters set includes a performance by Camerata Rhenania and Eugen Duvier.  Similarly the Sonata in E-Flat Major for Flute and Harpsichord (BWV 1031) is performed here by Sharon Bezaly and Terence Charlston, while in the other set it is performed by The Moravian Trio.  About a quarter of the same works are similarly presented on the other set by different performers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis set includes a nice variety of high quality performances at a great value.  There is definitely tremendous value to those who want to listen to these works sequentially with all the movements.  While both sets provide some complete works, and the other set still has sufficient variety, the Rise of the Masters collection is a better value at this time.  I hope you get to purchase and enjoy one or both of these collections.\n\nEnjoy.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Although they went into exile with very little drama, it seemed a very real possibility back in 2012 that Thrice may never return. With band lynchpin\/frontman Dustin Kensrue forsaking the music business for a gig with the Mars Hill Church and the genre they helped nurture seemingly being driven into the ground, it was almost a forgone conclusion that the glory days of albums like \"The Artist In The Amublance\" and \"Vheissu\" were in the rear-view mirror for good. Thankfully, such wasn't the case as \"To Be Everywhere Is To Be Nowhere\" -- the follow-up to 2011's \"Major\/Minor\" and the band's ninth album overall -- sounds as if the guys never missed a beat.\n\nHaving parted ways with the aforementioned Mars Hill Cult...err...I mean Church amidst accusations of corruption (and the ultimate dissolution of the whole darn entity), it's no surprise that Kensrue returns to the fold with a force so strong you believe he could breath fire or make the Earth shake. Opening with the anthemic, tidal-wave riffing of \"Hurricane,\" it's clear from the get-go that the Thrice we've all come to know and love is still intact. Kensrue sounds as fired up as ever, while the band themselves are game, showing a unity and tightness few Warped Tour graduates have achieved. The overall sound and production of the album continues the organic approach taken by 2009's \"Beggars\" and \"Major\/Minor\" but drives home with an intensity not heard since 2005's \"Vheissu.\" Tracks like the Radiohead-inspired \"Salt & Shadow\" and earnest \"The Long Defeat\" take time for Kensrue to bleed his soul, while \"Stay With Me,\" a ballad that could be seen as corny in the wrong hands, benefits from the frontman's characteristic sincerity. On the other end of the spectrum, the dark and biting \"Black Honey\" takes aim at the United States government's continued insistence upon violating other countries and cultures in the name of profit, while heavier fare such as \"Blood On The Sand\" and \"Whisteblower\" in particular seem aimed at The Mars Hill Church quite specifically.\n\nWith a five year gap in between releases, it's incredible how rock solid Thrice's comeback is. There is not a moment of fat that could have been trimmed, just pure passion and intensity from front to back. \"To Be Everywhere Is To Be Nowhere\" carries all the weight and glory of past Thrice releases, with passion and hope for the future. Here's to Thrice catching their second wind. We needed it, and it sounds like they needed it even more.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"We all know the story. After 1992 and the grunge invasion, most hair metal bands split into three categories: some stuck to their guns and kept releasing albums in that style (FireHouse, Slaughter, etc), others split up and were never heard from again, and others attempted to embrace the grunge sound and release music in that vein. \"Insanity Beach\" is more of the latter; there are only a couple of songs that would sound similar to the band's earlier work. Instead of going full on grunge, however, Sleeze Beez pulled a Skid Row and just made their sound grittier. As a result, most of the songs don't have hooks, and it's hard to distinguish between them at times. There are some highlights however, as this album contains one or two of the band's best songs. If you like \"Slave to the Grind\" and \"Subhuman Race\" by Skid Row, you'll like this album. It's sound is kind of a mix between those two albums. The party rock may be long gone, but this is still a good listen.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Five MARVELOUS Stars. From the album The Best of Spanky & Our Gang, 20th Century Masters, The Millennium Collection, this is the short-lived, so-called sunshine pop vocal and instrumental group, Spanky & Our Gang performing their lovely, swinging performance of their classic hit song, Like To Get To Know You that continues to get lots of airplay by the oldies but goodies radio stations. The group was led by Elaine Spanky McFarlane whose sultry, attractive, distinctive voice gave the group its unique vocal sound. The Our Gang septet members were: Malcolm Hale, Nigel Pickering, Paul Oz Bach, John Seiter, Kenny Hodges, and Lefty Baker, all on vocals, plus Max Bennett on bass, Larry Knechtel on piano, Mike Deasy on guitar, and Hal Blaine on drums, and an 11 piece string section. Unfortunately, arranger\/guitarist Malcolm Hale died in an accident and the group chose to not go on without him in 1969. But their marvelous music, which transcends musical genres, has been re-packaged several time in re-issues and is thankfully available in the digital MP3 era. This one song alone shows they were already talented artists who could mix genres in creating highly-attractive vocal and instrumentally rhythmic music\n\nThe song Like To Get To Know You was written by producer Stuart Scharf and is about the search for love. Arranger Hale creates a marvelous shifting musical setting combining rock, latin, jazz, and classical musical devices. It is actually built on a subtle latin beat and uses an advanced musical pedal point that can be repeated endlessly if desired: a form that jazz men Ahmad Jamal, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane used to great advantage as modal music. Legendary drummer Blaine, the most recorded drummer in recording history, whips up a subtle storm behind the group throughout the performance.\n\nThe song Like To Get To Know You is a favorite that is begins with an attractive buoyant drum beat, violins, and a comping piano over drum rimshots. The song is build on the infectious repetition of call-response lyrics like Id like to get to know you', (\"yes I would\"): \"Id like to get to know you\", (\"if I could) and so on. The male members and Spanky trade lyrics until Spanky enters alone on the bridge with a sassy delivery which continues on with the main lyric and the refrain. Then suddenly comes a lovely, idyllic interlude with ethereal echoes, strings, and guitars which sets the stage for a pretty vocal coda that includes the male voices and Spankys voice in another call-response phase that vamps to the fadeout. Produced by Stuart Scharf. What a marvelous performance and a feat of studio engineering! My Highest Recommendation. Five APPEALING Stars. (Island Mercury records. 1-MP3 track. Time-3:18.)","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this guy. His vocals are smooth, soulful and damn sexy. He's also made some great songs (singles and otherwise). Most of his material is good.\n\nHowever once in a while he creates something you're a little indifferent about. This song takes things a notch below that even. I don't like it. First time I heard this song I didn't know what to think. He went from mostly smooth, meaningful ballads on his last album to...t h i s. I know sometimes ballads don't always move product but man. This song is the worst! I was actually interested in knowing what the song would be like since when I first watched the video it was upbeat. Had no problems with that. But once the singing started and I listened to the lyrics I was highly unimpressed. The beat is not my cup of tea at all. The only thing I really like about the song is the guests (although to be fair they don't particularly add anything to this song).\n\nSome have said that they like this song because it's upbeat. That's fine but I think most people that like this have seen the video and are just thinking one word: SEX. Sorry. Just not impressed in the least. Hope his album has some quality records whether they are fast or slow. Any more songs like this and I will have an eternal headache. I probably only made it through the whole video once.\n\n2 stars.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Ah, that perennial conundrum. Is it a smooth jazz performance or is it just instrumental pop? For years I've railed against artistes like Kenny G, George Howard, Najee and even Norman Brown (for a minute); artistes who not only think it's clever to play their instruments along the vocal melodies of pop songs and claim they're playing jazz but actually go on to have massive commercial success at it. They play just enough improvisation to substantiate their claims but not too much, so as not to scare the horses. Not that I've got anything against jazz artistes doing pop tunes. Even the heavyweight Pat Metheny did a cover on his last solo album, \"One Quiet Night\" but it was a Norah Jones song and it was almost a one-off. He certainly doesn't do entire albums of covers. I just think it's lazy and boring.\n\n\"As seen on: Oprah [and] The Today Show\", proudly stated the sticker that came on this CD and indeed, although I had been aware for some time of his seemingly endless residence on the Billboard charts, it was on Ms Winfrey's show that I first heard Chris Botti. Oprah's no fool, I thought, and while nothing I heard on the show made me believe that this was anything other than what I thought it was, his appearance on the show was enough to make me want to find out more. I wanted to be sure before I dismissed him outright.\n\nBut the expected ennui did not come. Right from the first tune, I was taken in by the lush orchestration, which reminded me of great classic music and movies from the 40s and 50s. His trumpet playing is straightforward enough but it has a quality of tone to it that was mesmerising. I immediately imagined myself kicking back on a high-rise balcony looking out on the city, late at night or on a sea front patio gazing out to sea. I told my friend: \"The music just lifts you up and you feel like you want to grow wings and go kiss the stars.\" All in all, it's pretty amazing stuff.\n\nAnd while some of the songs, like \"No Ordinary Love\", do appear rather tidy, rather predictable, there are others, like \"Let's Fall In Love\", \"Make Someone Happy\" and \"Cinema Paradiso\" (which has a wonderful piano solo by Billy Childs), that are more daring and where he really kicks in some oomph and gets real jazzy. I think there's something here for everyone. Paula Cole sounds angelic lovely on \"What'll I Do?\" and \"How Love Should Be\" and Sting adds additional credibility and swing on \"La Belle Dame Sans Regrets\". \"Nearness of You\" is one of the most moving ballads I've heard in a while and \"One For My Baby\" just made me want to cry. Maybe because that song always reminds me of Frank Sinatra.\n\nBut is it jazz? Well, it's not quite as adventurous as Miles Davis or as complicated as Kenny Wheeler but on the whole, I think it is, and good jazz at that. It's incredibly accessible; hence it's chart success, but maybe jazz needs to be. Sometimes.","classification":5,"fold":9}

It was only one of three singles that ever cracked the Top Twenty for the Bay Area funk-soul band Tower of Power (1973).

Then, some beautiful strings highlight the chorus as the famous TOP horns ramp up to a crescendo. The lyrics are heartfelt, powerful, emotional. and painful, as the singer looks back at a relationship where he blew it, and now realizes his mistakes. He wants to make amends, but alas, it's too late. He must leave now, because of all the damage he did to her and their relationship. She has moved on with her life. Despite this, he is still so very deep in love with her, which is why it is \"So Very Hard to Go.\" Halfway through the song, there is that powerful sax solo that makes this tune so memorable.

{"text":"A year after the stripped-down attack of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Special-Forces\/dp\/B002XIN11M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Special Forces<\/a>, Alice Cooper produced another album in the same vein. Though this time with added theatrical flair and the return of guitarist Dick Wagner. Cooper continued to assume new identities, such as the famed swordsman of \"Zorro's Ascent\" and the put-upon son of \"Make That Money (Scrooge's Song).\" Some of the performances seem labored, and Wagner's distinctive guitar riffs feel as if they were grafted onto the songs to add flash. The stagey ballad \"I Am the Future\" might have worked well as a production number, but with Cooper descending back into alcohol addiction there was no tour. What works well is Cooper's humor on \"No Baloney Homosapiens,\" \"I Like Girls\" and \"Remarkably Insincere.\" And on \"Tag, You're It\" he indulges his longtime love of cheesy cinema with a song full of slasher-film clichs. If there was no 1970s legacy with which to compare this, one might stumble upon this and think it's a long-lost power-pop album from a surprisingly talented lyricist. It's all quite listenable, and even fun as it passes by, but it's not nearly as memorable as his earlier (and some of his later) works. Collectors' Choice's domestic reissue adds the UK-only 1982 single \"For Britain Only,\" and its four-panel booklet includes new liner notes by Gene Sculatti.

{"text":"Being a fan of both Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk, I was torn--should I wish for the old, or embrace the new?\n\nI'm pleased with this score:  its sound may not carry the most recognizable musical themes I remember from the original, but the tone of Daft Punk's score is well matched to the world of Tron just the same.  Consider it more faithful to the *spirit* of Carlos' original score and you'll be happy.  There are sweeping synth passages that pulse and build in intensity (\"Recognizer\"), digital coughs and blips lifted straight out of an '80s arcade, and all of it is arranged in a way that clearly belongs in the film.  Strings blend excellently into the mix, such as the tracks \"Outlands\" and \"Flynn Lives\".\n\nSometimes a soundtrack--particularly one by a mainstream artist--can be more about promoting the artist than it is about the movie (for  example, the \"Spawn\" soundtrack was more about making two bands collaborate for each song and pulling music from multiple genres).  Daft Punk are very focused on the task at hand:  they create a sonic soundscape that reminds me why Vangelis' \"Chariots of Fire\" took the mainstream by storm--\"The Grid\", \"Arena\" and \"Rinzler\" are very similar.  The music to Tron: Legacy sounds just retro enough to hearken back to 1980 while just appealing enough to not sound stale today.\n\nIf you're looking for a good sampling of what's here, listen to the passage from \"Nocture\" to \"End of Line\" to \"Derezzed\" to \"Fall\".  If you want one of the few moments the score sounds most like Daft Punk, that would be \"Solar Sailor\".  And if you are considering the digital download, yes you do get the booklet.  It doesn't show as available in the track listing but when you download you will receive a digital copy of the booklet in PDF form.\n\nNOTE:  the downloadable MP3 album from Amazon contains one bonus track.  However, reviewers are stating that the downloadable version(s) available from other Amazon stores (such as in the UK at Amazon.co.uk) offer a larger \"2 disc\" version of the album.  A completist might want to mull over the difference and download that version instead.  I'm not sure how the exchange rate factors into such a purchase, so if you're not from the UK, keep that in mind.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Currents is such a good album. Kevin Parker is just my favorite musician in the past 15 years. (i am only 20, but all I listen to is 60's and 70's rock) so I have been getting into newer music, 2000 and beyond, and out of everyone, Kevin Parker is at the very very tip top tier of genius musicians 2010s. He is so good at creating fantastic songs. I mean Innerspeaker I just love, and you can easily play all four sides without skipping a track. Lonerism, same thing. Lonerism was like my stoner anthem two years ago and holds a little piece of my heart with some awesome summer memories. And these two albums were similar-ish, but at the same time totally different. Lonerism seemed to have that pop thing starting, and was a little more adventurous and experimental with songs like Apocalypse Dreams and others. Then we get to Currents. WOW!!! Such a change, it's incredible. I listened to it first time on the turntable and really appreciated the sound. On disc 1 side two I started thinking \"hmmmm... I'm not sure if I am a fan of this sad lovey dovey pop stuff\" but then you just start to crave it... Now I just want to play all four sides so badly, it's just an infectious album. Love the change he is trying. Totally mind blowing dream pop with just some of the most catchy songs. Favorite song so far would have to be Cause I'm a Man and also, for some reason, Past Life. I love Tame Impala and I think the more I listen to this album, the more chance it has at being better than Lonerism or Innerspeaker. Definitely a great album and totally recommended.

{"text":"Like so many, I had a feverish reaction to Chan \"Cat Power\" Marshall's breakthrough opus, 1998's Moon Pix. In those days Marshall could only sort of play guitar and kind of sing, yet she undeniably knew how to make a unique album. In the years since, Marshall has become a competent - and even creative - guitarist, a very good songwriter and, most considerably, one of the hardest working and distinct vocalists of her time. That voice, it soars.\n\nMarshall's last album-full of originals, 2006's The Greatest, pushed the artist to another level. No longer was she the shy indie rock pixie with boyish good looks and artsy singer\/songwriter fare; she was now a tall, model-esque soul singer with a big, full-sounding soul album that thousands of people were suddenly buying with their coffee and paper towels at the Target cash wrap. Sun, Cat Power's seventh album of originals (and ninth overall), takes a step back from the big box checkout line, offering up Marshall's most artsy batch of tunage since the beloved Moon Pix.\n\nDespite not having the clearest, most approachable sound, I think Sun is most definitely an accessible, confident even poppy record. Its language isn't nearly as universal as the soul sound of The Greatest, and the song structures and arrangements aren't as avant-garde as Moon Pix or the the two records that came before it. We hear drum machines contrasted against gritty licks, the focus always on Marshall's voice, which is more subtle, layered and nuanced than on recent records. Where The Greatest was bombastic in its straight-forward style, Sun is a minimalist exercise in labored detail, the Cat having clearly spent much time hunched over the keyboards and samplers that ornament her basic tracks. The result is a stylistically challenging listen that, while more instantly accessible than it sounds, rewards familiarity with the kind of tasteful, timeless, hip detail Marshall has long been known for.\n\n\"3,6,9,\" one of the three (Or is it six? Or is it nine?) tracks that first helped me to understand this anew Cat, feels, at first, like a modern-era pop mess.  Marshall includes so many production details - including bits of auto-tune - into what is otherwise a straightforward pop song that reminds me, in sprit at least, of Marah's Float Away with the Friday Night Gods, a very hated, highly misunderstood attempt at big pop appeal. A few listens later and my aesthetic impression moved from Float Away to U2's Pop, a similarly modern and gutsy stab at high-production pop rock. Fun, strange, challenging rides, both.\n\nWhy release an artsy, challenging, possibly off-putting pop record after achieving breakthrough status with a loyal genre record like The Greatest? Because, as noted above, Marshall is nothing if not an album-maker. A Bowie-inspired creative spirit who prefers the thrill of creative challenge to the comfort of strategic art. We hear that spirit, that freedom, on every track. The biggest achievement here is how Marshall has managed to form her sprawling ideas about modern pop - and classical songwriter style - in a cohesive piece.\n\nIt's anybody's guess what the legacy of Sun will be. My assumption is that, despite being maybe her most catchy batch of tunes, the record will endure as a deep catalog treasure amongst Cat Power enthusiasts. A side note favorite, loved for its strong personality and creative bravery. To me, Sun is not just one of the year's most interesting and accomplished listens, but also the second best Cat Power disc yet, stuck only behind 2003's tremendous You Are Free.

{"text":"Meek Mill, is also known as the rising prince of Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group reigning from Philidelphia. Philidelphia is home to some of Hip Hop's legends such as Will Smith, Eve and of course The Roots. Meek Mill is considered the new generation of Hip Hop and to be perfectly honest, he's not doing anything to help it. Meek Mill is known for his brash and in your face personality but thats because he practically yells and shouts in just about every damn track on this album. Now before I start to offend all Meek Mill fans all around, I will admit that the dude is a very aggressive spitter which I can appreciate because I don't think a person can fall asleep while Meek Mill's voice is playing; and he does surprisingly have rhymes scattered throughout the album, but at the end of the day there is nothing substantial here. All that I got from Meek Mill throughout the album is how unnecessarily braggadocios he is as a person. Every track is about rags to riches, getting women, and how much better (he thinks) he is compared to your favorite rapper to an extent. This kind of theme has been done a hundred times over and I am really sick and tired of it, there is nothing inspiring about this guy whatsoever. What he lacks that is important for any rapper is storytelling, and the poor excusese for storylines that are hidden within the album are dry. The sad thing is that Meek Mill trys to tie in his more conceptual tracks, but they just fail to connect.\n\nThe beats on this album are no different than what was on Rick Ross's album or his latest MMG compilation that came out not too long ago. The beats literally sounded like one guy produced the entire project, which is sad because when I saw the production credits, every track was produced by a different person, which is preposterous because just about every song had the same bass line and drum samples that Lex Luger would've done (ironically Lex Luger didn't produce anything on this album). \"Believe It\" feat. Rick Ross is literaly the same beat from BMF (Blowin Money Fast), The first 2 tracks are way too similar in lyrics and beat to even count as 2 different songs and like I said earlier Meek Mill sticks with the same generic flow in every song; his volume, his tone, his range rarely ever changes whether it be a slow or mid-tempo song, and I'm just listening being appalled of how repetitive it is.\n\nIf I looked at the lyrics for a Meek Mill song online, than I would expect the lyrics to be in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS and EXLAMATION POINTS for all his verses because thats what I feel I am listening to when Meek Mill raps\n\nBy the time I'm finished with track 3, I just comepletely clock out and start skipping tracks quickly until the mood starts to shift into the slower songs like \"Amen\" feat Drake. When you compare Hip Hop albums by the end of the year with other artists, you will quickly realize that this album is mediocre at best and lacks originality or even a genuwine personality. I haven't heard an album thats this shallow in quite some time. The amazing thing is I was really trying to listen to the album and find songs where Meek Mill raps more introspectively so at least I can get a grasp of what kind of person he was growing up, but ultimately I just found that this guy is 100% boring as a person. The impression I got from Meek Mill is that he is rapping solely for money, not to inspire any of his listeners, not to put out any positive messages, but just putting on a front of being a tough guy or a ladies man 24\/7. The only reason why I didn't give this album 1 star is because some of the beats (although extremely similar) do occasionally entertain me when I am driving blasting my speakers. I will never pay any mind to any of Meek Mill's albums again and I know that after a 2 weeks this album will undoubtedly be forgotten. If you want a project from the new generation of Hip Hop that has good storytelling, contains substance, and sounds cohesive? Than check out Kendrick Lamar's \"good kid, m. A.A.d city\" album or Ab-Soul's \"Control System\" which are easy contenders for Rap albums of the year.","classification":2,"fold":9}

Well rounded and crafted with chilling vocal performances by Sullivan,  `Love Me Back' is both creative and retro, blending old and new styles together well.  There are no misses or songs that find the vocalist ever choking as `Love Me Back' proves to be nearly flawless and finds Sullivan improving as a vocalist if anything.  While it will always be `Fearless's' \"Bust Your Windows\" that defines the rise of this star, she has continued her upswing strongly on this exceptionally well thought out second effort.\n\n\"Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles)\" should come over as extremely clumsy given its manic production, but instead, Sullivan `holds down' the multiple samplings and gimmicks of the production extremely well.  Vocally, Sullivan is perfect with a well nuanced performance and solid songwriting, most notable on the soulful hook: \"I Keep going in circles, circles\/round and round\/and while you're doing me so wrong\/I just keep holding you down\/ I feel so stupid, foolish\/loving you this way\/But what can I say\/But I wanna go\/I wanna go\/but I keep coming back.\" On the equally sound \"10 Seconds\" (another track built around soulful sampling), the production is superb and Sullivan absolutely KILLS it with her soulful vocals.  Again, superb songwriting serves as the buttress, particularly on the intelligent chorus once again: \"one, two, three (four!)\/five, six seven (ooh)\/eight, nine, baby I'm getting closer...\"  Sullivan is two for two; 2-0.\n\n\"Good Enough\" is a nice change of pace as far as production work.  Here, Sullivan achieves great attitude.  The bridge may be the highlight as it serves as an `epic' moment.  \"Don't Make Me Wait\" is a departure for Sullivan, finding her singing over a neo-disco groove - something we've never heard from her before.  The production is solid and while the vocal parts may be written the slightest bit too fast-paced, it is another solid, noteworthy performance.  Similarly, \"Love You Long Time\" features big drums that provide a rhythmic driven production work.  A short performance, the cut packs enough punch with superbly commanding vocals by its muse.\n\n\"Redemption\" is an oddity, but also a personal favorite.  Sullivan opens up the track rapping and instantly gives the impression that there is a `story' behind this cut.  She brings it all together on a soulful, gospel laden hook in which she asks the Lord to \"... hear the sinner's prayer.\"  By the bridge section, Jazmine's soulful vocals take over and captivate making this both one of the album's anomalies and highlights.  \"Excuse Me\" may be the very best moment of the album - `the crowning achievement' of `Love Me Back.' Here again, a sampling approach to the production work helps to `amp up' the soulfulness of the performance.\n\nSullivan follows-up the valedictory \"Excuse Me\" with \"U Get On My Nerves\" featuring Ne-Yo, a fine duet.  The chemistry between the vocalists is unquestionable.  On \"Stuttering,\" Sullivan once again shocks with a gimmicky performance, but not like the rest of contemporary R&B these days; even with her use of gimmicks, it seems more soulful and classy than other artists who couldn't pull this off.  \"Famous\" features a fine driving (rather pounding) beat.  \"Famous\" is not the best of the album, but with such a consistent effort as this, it is by no means bad. Closing cut \"LUV Back\" is a surprising uptempo cut to close the album.  The production is spastic, but do we expect any less from the creative, cerebral production of Missy Elliott? (The Answer is a rhetorical `no' by the way.)\n\nOverall, `Love Me Back' is another fine addition to the R&B discography of 2010.  Let's face it - this girl can `sang.' It is a shame that R&B has became so based on `trends' that we fail to honor those new singers that are avoiding gimmicks for nuanced, complete vocals performances like Sullivan, Chrisette Michele, etc.  Exceptional effort!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"He had an incredibly soulful voice and was an exceptionally gifted musician to boot. Young \"Stevie\" Winwood as he was known back then was just 18 years old when the Spencer Davis Group burst onto the scene in early 1967. Within just a few months the group boasted a pair of Top Ten singles. Yes, the future appeared extremely bright for this four man band from Birmingham, England. But Stevie Winwood had other ideas. Before the end of the year he would leave the Spencer Davis Group to form his own band that he dubbed Traffic. Winwood's timing was impeccable because Top 40 radio was just beginning to wane and within just a few years album-oriented rock stations would come to dominate the FM band. Over the next decade Traffic would become a staple of these AOR radio stations. In 1969 Winwood also became a part of rock's very first supergroup Blind Faith. Then in 1980 Steve Winwood would embark on a highly successful solo career.\n\nDuring the decade of the 1980's Steve Winwood would amass more than a dozen charted singles including 6 Top Ten hits.  Of these the most  acclaimed was hit 1986 # 1 hit \"Higher Love\".  With background vocals from Chaka Kahn \"Higher Love\" would spend a total of 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  The song would snag a couple of Grammys including \"Record of the Year\" and \"Pop Male Vocal\" of the year.  One of the best singles of the 1980's.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Not just brilliant at what she has done, but she never felt tiresome or annoying, unlike other divas like Rihanna and Beyonce'. She has done fairly well with duets. While I did not like the duet she did with Beyonce' on Put It In A Love Song from her last record, her collaboration with Maxwell on Fire We Make works much better. The third single from Girl On Fire absolutely works very well. They both have excellent chemistry in the song, and it brings out a soft and sensual vibe that really works into the song. If you have never heard a good duet in awhile, this is one I definitely recommend. It is much better than what Girl On Fire was for Alicia, and teaming up with Maxwell was a brilliant seduction.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Beset by legal wrangles for much of its history, the music recorded for Apple has generally been less readily available than it would otherwise have been. Despite those problems, the important recordings, particularly by Badfinger and Mary Hopkin, have been available on CD. Nevertheless, a lot of other material has remained in the vaults. The release of this eclectic compilation apparently signifies the end of Apple's legal problems; let's hope so. The compilation is well presented, with the booklet containing copious notes about each song, which is particularly useful for learning a little about the obscure artist, though even the comments about the familiar songs may occasionally surprise you.\n\nOf course, Mary Hopkin (Those were the days, Goodbye) and Badfinger (Come and get it, Day after day, plus Maybe Tomorrow, credited to the Iveys who evolved into Badfinger) are represented, .but the primary purpose of this compilation (apart from selling plenty of copies) is clearly to showcase the range of music recorded for Apple, and it does that superbly, with a great variety .of sounds and styles.\n\nAside  from the tracks by Badfinger and Mary Hopkin, the compilation is notable for the inclusion of Carolina in my mind (James Taylor), Thingumybob (a TV theme by the Black Dyke Mills Band), two gospel recordings by Billy Preston (That's the way God planned it,  plus a cover of My sweet Lord), an excellent track by the under-rated Doris Troy (Ain't that cute) and a cover of Give peace a chance, performed in a reggae style by the Hot Chocolate Band, who as Hot Chocolate became very successful throughout the seventies and early eighties.\n\nThere are a lot of other great tracks here, all of which were originally released as A-sides of singles, but not all of which charted. The story given about King of Fuh is somewhat amusing. It certainly isn't the best track here, but it never received airplay at the time so it is in effect a new release. The inclusion of such rarities makes the compilation is more interesting than it would have been had it focused exclusively on the big hits, but it also means that the compilation subtitle, Best of Apple records, is not entirely true. Still, those hits and other important recordings (such as Badfinger's original version of Without you) will surely appear on a future Apple compilation.\n\nEnjoy this for what it is - a fascinating insight into the diverse music recorded for Apple records - and look forward to a follow-up compilation eventually.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This very British band is just an amazing mix of driving beats, vocals filled with whatever emotion is required of them, and lyrics that take on a number of subjects that usually require a more mature voice to be this good. I think it will take a few years before these guys hit their stride, but this debut has enough diversity and quality to leave you very satisfied. They might end up being too \"English\" for American tastes, but for me they really nailed it. Starting out with high energy numbers like \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor\" and \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\" set you up for a completely up tempo CD and then comes the quiet thoughtful reading of \"Riot Van,\" where the tune totally belies the lyrics. Either the humor is spot on, in titles like \"Perhaps Vampires is a bit Strong...\" which is definitely not the sentiment in the song; or wicked social commentary is clearly expressed on songs like \"When The Sun Goes Down.\"  The band does a good job on both types. The only drawback is the music can occasionally get a bit repetitive with the same pounding guitars and drums for a few too many songs, but that's a minor complaint compared to what this band brings to the table; a fresh approach.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"First of all,\nTo all subcribers of the \"Dave's Picks\" series that still haven't received this third edition of the series you must call Rhino Records and leave a message on the phonelines over there as Grateful Dead Productions are not handling the shipping of this hard to get your hands on set. I called Rhino on Wednesday of this week and they returned my call in less than two hours and the guy told me on that return call that there is no tracking information available on the large number of discs (hundreds? thousands?) that were lost and never delivered to the folks that ordered the series and the others that ordered this set on it's own merits and caused the \"Dave's Picks\" to sell out long before the original ship date of: 1 August 2012. After my phone call with a real live person from Rhino I plucked \"Dave's Picks - Vol. 3\" outta my mailbox three days later on Saturday and now I'm back in \"Dead Nirvana\" listening to this fine addition to a already great series of live Grateful Dead music.\n\nREMEMBER: If you don't call Rhino they will have no knowledge that you never received this third volume in the first place and no replacement is gonna be coming your way! CALL!!!\n\nNow, the review:\nThis four part series of live sets of Grateful Dead music has visted 1974 and 1977 prior to this third edition from Chicago in October 1971 and these are Keith Godchaux's second and third shows as a member of the Grateful Dead on his very first tour. The first night of the stand in Chicago was an FM broadcast that was a stable of tapers lists (remember those days?) and the entire contents of the third disc of this Dave's Picks is taken from that first night.\n\nThis second night in Chicago is from a beautiful theater in downtown Chicago with fantastic acoustics and to be lucky enough to see the Grateful Dead in a venue this amazing could only have happened back then in the early seventies as the band's popularity would very soon outgrow these wonderful types of small theaters as \"Grateful Dead\" (aka: \"Skull & Roses\") had just been released and would serve as the band's first gold record and the scene was about to become so very much bigger within months as the Dead Heads were growing into a force now and this li'l band was to become global in the Spring of 1972 when Europe got to see them perform.\n\n\"Bertha\" opens the first set and it's a touch longer than the standard version found on \"Skull & Roses\" and it shows Jerry is outta the gate and feelin' fine with a cool fire found in his fingers and the band is right there with him. Billy, hold down the drums on his lonesome as Mickey Hart had left the band as 1971 was dawning and Mister Kreutzmann had now become an even  better drummer than before. Cowboy Bob gets to ride again with: \"Mexicali Blues\" and \"Me & Bobby McGee\" and a once stately Chicago auditorium is very quickly transformed into a wild west rodeo in proper Dead fashion. Phil Lesh, shines through in the mix and leads the charge through a mighty 28 minute version of: \"The Other One\" that is center piece of disc two.\n\nKeith, is heard well on this but he is still making baby steps in his playing at this early stage as a member of the band. The Grateful Dead is now a much different band than it was just a few months earlier when Pigpen was singing the blues and playing that harp and laying in his funky organ parts. The new band is driven by the song and not the jams and brand new tunes like: \"Brown-Eyed Women\" are piano ditties that Keith was born to play and he is about to breakout as a major force of what made this new edition of the band so great.\n\nAlmost every song that a Head wants to hear in concert is a part of this third \"Dave's Pick.\" You are getting: \"Dark Star\" \"Truckin\" \"Sugar Magnolia\" \"St. Stephen\" \"Casey Jones\" \"Playing In The Band\" \"Jack Straw\" and: \"Johnny B. Goode.\" This newest: \"Picks\" is as close to a greatest-hits set as The Grateful Dead is ever gonna play and the sound in HDCD is how it was always meant to be heard. Thirty one songs of live Dead spread out over three hours on three compact discs is quite a treat for the ears. You are gonna have fun with this one!\nFour Stars!","classification":4,"fold":9}

The fact still remains this album is a good listen. Lyrically yes it's a 3 star album at best, but the end product is really really good. Fantastic for riding around, and letting the sub woofer cut loose. The best thing about the album is there is only 11 tracks which means it's short and to the point. Ross went with a very uncommon approach towards the beginning of the album. He starts if off slow and the albums momentum picks up as it goes along. Uncommon, but a very very good method it turns out. This being my first rick album I am satisfied with what I have. Music for a ground shaking ride down the street. Something I can bop my head to for most of the day. Hip Hop should be about more than who rhymes the best. It's about good music, and this is good music.","classification":4,"fold":9}

I cannot stop listening to this song, even if I wanted to.  What I love even more is how androgynous she looks in the video.  By the second verse, she undresses her hair and some of her clothes and turns into a sexy stripper.\n\nFlorence took a lot of risks with this song and video, and it paid off rather well.

{"text":"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to \"Cooleyhighharmony\", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nThis album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before \"Khalil\") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.\n\nPart 1 has \"Thank You\" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. \"Vibin'\" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'\/dancin' the night away\/Groovin'\/Vibin'\/non-stop until the break of day). \"I Sit Away\" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and \"Nobody Knows\"..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)\n\nIn the \"slow side\", Babyface's \"I'll Make Love to you\" set a record for the length of time at #1. \"On Bended Knee\" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and \"Water Runs Dry\" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic \"Yesterday\" and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.\n\nLOWS:\n\n\"All Around the World\" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's \"Travelin' Man\" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, \"Khalil\" is a pretty blah track. \"Jezzebel\" is a dull overlong affair. \"50 Candles\" includes the lyric \"Holding your body like a plastic molding\"....'nuff said.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nThere are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like \"I Sit By\" and \"Yesterday\" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"John Legend is one artist that I would sign to my record label provided that I had one. He has the look, the uniqueness, and, most importantly, the talent. All of his albums are worth purchasing. The best thing about him is the fact that he can be appreciated by the younger audience as well as the \"grown folks.\" People just love him. What probably gave him some free publicity is the fact that Kanye West basically put him on the forefront and let him spread his wings; now he flies confidently in solitude. Sure, Kanye usually throws a rap on a song for him with most of his LPs, but John Legend can surely stand on his own two feet.\n\nI was very entertained with \"Evolver.\" He can definitely call himself that because he does do different things, yet he always gives us that classic sound which includes his great voice and much use of an instrument called piano. \"Green Light\" was well-received by music listeners. Legend caught us off guard with this up-tempo track which features the wonderful Andre 3000 of OutKast. \"Green Light\" has such a fine melody, perhaps that is why this song is so radio-friendly. The second release was \"Everybody Knows.\" I can recall my brother continually playing that song and telling me to listen to it closely. I could not get into it at first, but now I certainly like it, especially when he says, \"Nobody has it easy.\" Oh what a sweet love song \"Good Morning\" is. This song has a laid back feel and is very well produced. My girl Brandy comes as a surprise on this album, but it was such a pleasant surprise because I like just about anything she does. She and Legend both hold their own on this track. She really has progressed vocally over the years and for that, she should be commended. A job well done to Midi Mafia for producing a fine number for the two.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, do pick up this album along with \"Get Lifted\" and \"Once Again.\" They are all worth the investment.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Quickly\"\n2. \"Green Light\"\n3. \"Cross that Line\"\n4. \"Good Morning\"\n5. \"Everybody Knows\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

And Tegan & Sara do the same on this album.  It's mostly pop, but still retains indie elements. And it's a nice formula.  Pure indie music can be too challenging, and pure pop music can be bland.  Instead, the best of both worlds are combined - the catchiness of pop and the creativity of indie.\n\nAll of the songs here have a synth-pop formula.  Most are upbeat, some are mid-tempo. Unlike their previous releases, there is little acoustic guitar.  The title \"Heartthrob\" is appropriate for this album.  The lyrical content of every song deals with love - sometimes heartbreak, sometimes joy.  And the lyrics are pretty introspective. Unlike other synth-pop albums, none of the songs deal with partying. The songs have some similarities to Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, and Robyn. Tegan and Sara's new sound is more indie than Katy Perry, yet more pop than Ellie Goulding.  To an extent, Tegan and Sara echo 80s synth-oriented new wave bands on this album. The synth beats sound both retro and modern.\n\nThe stronger tracks on this album are \"Closer\", \"I Was A Fool\", \"I'm Not Your Hero\", \"How Come You Don't Want Me\", \"Now I'm All Messed Up\". \"Closer\" has the best chorus.  \"I'm Not Your Hero\" has the best lyrics.  \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" the best beats.\n\nTegan and Sara have always been underrated as an indie band. Sadly, as a pop band, they'll likely remain underrated.  If you haven't checked them out, do so.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The reason why Bjork will never ascend to commercial wonderland is also the reason why her music & personality is so fascinating. The reason - her odd and experimental music. Selmasongs, which are songs culled from the movie Dancer In The Dark where she also won critical acclaim as well as a Best Actress trophy for her performance, is a continuation of her ever ingenious probe into the music world. From the dramatic opening, Overture, to the dark and haunting ballad with Tom Yorke of Radiohead, I've Seen it All and the wonderful conclusion New World, the music sets the stage for the scenes in the movie.

{"text":"I think Tegan and Sara are the nicest thing that has ever happened to emo music and folk music. I have enjoyed them ever since I heard them in their first band called That Dog, singing sweet, sweet songs such as I Just Threw Out The Love Of My Dreams. However, from there, these two Adam Lamberts have only gotten bigger, badder and better. Fo\/s\/h\/i\/z\/zle.\n\nWhile I am excruciatingly grateful for their new direction--synth-pop meets Disco Inferno--I am even more grateful that they have produced a non-stop array of songs that are very profound, deep and meaningful on Heartthrob. Let's take the first offering, shall we?\n\nI Was A Fool is clearly a song praising the state of Massachusetts for legalizing g\/a\/y\/ m\/a\/r\/r\/iage, which is rad, dude, mainly because Obama told me so. I also love the diversity in the song choices on this CD. It's like Tegan looked at Sara who looked back at Tegan as she was still looking at Sara and said, \"Let's make a CD with absolutely no agenda, okay? Okay!\" Other winners are Now I'm All Messed Up (endorsing g\/a\/y\/ m\/a\/r\/r\/i\/age) and Shock To Your System (condemning traditional m\/a\/r\/r\/ia\/ge). So it's great to see how unbiased and totally agenda-less this CD is!\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that you need to purchase this CD, stat. It will teach you all about the awesomeness of these Perez Hilton girls, faster than you can say, \"Let's End Don't Ask, Don't Tell right now!\" Thanks to the age of moral-relativist tolerance from Obama, you should buy this CD and do your part to support the end of traditional m\/a\/r\/r\/i\/a\/ge!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Caveat: I am a huge James Horner soundtrack fan. Please read accordingly.\n\nAnother extremely expensive soundtrack remastering from the Star Trek film franchise, this one is actually two albums sailing under one flag.\n\nThe first disc has the original film score as it is in the movie, remastered, with the cues at full length.\n\nThe second has the remastered original soundtrack, which featured (and still features) alternate versions of some of the cues which Horner actually preferred to the ones used in the film itself.\n\nAll this is explained in the lavish booklet, which is a very nice affair, many pages long, with a potted history of the recordings and detailed sections on each cue on the film soundtrack.\n\nThe music itself borrows heavily the themes first heard on \"Wrath of Khan\" while tweaking them to give them a new character. It's early days yet, but I think this is going to end up being a contender for my favorite ST soundtrack (currently set to \"Kahn\").\n\nThe recording is exquisite, everything a remastering should be. The pieces are restored without heating them so much they drown out details.\n\nAnd right at the end of the film soundtrack disc is a medley heard  while McCoy is trying to scare up a ride to Genesis. It is a very amusing little piece with deliberately en-blanded muzak versions of classics like \"That Old Black Magic\", \"Tangerine\" and \"I Remember You\".\n\nExpensive, as I said, but worth the cost for me (and a much better experience on first encounter than the movie itself). Five Stars.","classification":5,"fold":9}

The title song Red is a good song about all the different emotions of a relationship.  And I have always thought she was a great writer.  She really has a gift especially to be so young.  We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together is maybe my least favorite song of her's.  It is over the top.  22 is good.  Everything Has Changed and Begin Again are my favorite songs.

{"text":"The Killers' debut album, \"Hot Fuss,\" was such a phenomenon that it was nearly impossible to follow-up with something as good. Well, the Killers have tried and delivered \"Sam's Town.\" For their second album, the foursome goes for a more rock-oriented approach, leaving behind much of the glam\/disco undertones of the previous album. Is it better? Judge for yourself. One thing is for sure, though: It's different.\n\nSounds like: Queen, Bruce Springsteen and the Cars rolled into one.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- They don't try to repeat themselves here. There are moments that somewhat callback to the first album, but for the most part, they took a real risk.\n\n- The production and musicianship are much stronger than before.\n\n- The album doesn't peter out on the second half like \"Hot Fuss\" did.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Unfortunately, nothing here really leaves quite the impression that the strongest tracks on \"Hot Fuss\" did.\n\nHits: \"When You Were Young,\" \"For Reasons Unknown,\" \"This River Is Wild,\" and \"Bones.\"\n\nMisses: \"Uncle Johnny\" a song that sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't seem to go anywhere.\n\nFuture: \"Sam's Town\" most likely won't be the massive hit it's predecessor was, but at the very least, the Killers have proven they aren't just a flash in the pan or a one-trick pony.\n\nPersonally: There's nothing here that gives me the chills that half of \"Hot Fuss\" did, which is surprising. But the album is still good to listen too, especially where the first album is starting to sound a bit stale at this point.\n\nBest Listened To When: \"Hot Fuss\" goes cold.","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"\"Sacred Love\" is a fascinating and inspiring collection of twelve pieces composed and performed by guitar virtuoso Shambhu and co-produced by Grammy Award-winning Windham Hill-founder Will Ackerman. Styles range from quiet meditations to Indian-jazz fusion, and some very impressive musicians join Shambhu on a wide variety of instruments. To quote Shambhu: \"my work has one goal: to convey a celestial abode in music and superb musicianship that invite listeners to explore, enjoy and reflect within.... 'Sacred Love' invites full-on, soulful listening.\" While it's true that this music won't stay in the background, it can provide a colorful backdrop for other activities. The blending of Eastern and Western musical traditions gives Shambhu's music a very distinctive sound, and the incredible team of Ackerman and engineer Corin Nelsen makes the quality of that sound as close to perfection as it can get.\n\n\"Sacred Love\" opens with \"Together,\" a joyful and optimistic piece that features Charlie Bisharat on violin, Premik Russell Tubbs on wind synth, and Tony Levin on bass - a great beginning! \"Edge of Eternal\" is quieter and more subdued, and features Imaginary Road regulars Jill Haley on English horn, Eugene Friesen on cello, and Noah Wilding on wordless vocals - lovely! \"Eyes of a Child\" is a gorgeous guitar solo that \"expresses the illumination of a child who still marvels at the beauty of simplicity and the simplicity of beauty.\" My favorite track is \"Natural Moment,\" a lively and upbeat celebration of oneness and cultural diversity. Shambhu performs on guitars, sitar, synth pads, and kalimba backed by Tony Levin, Charlie Bisharat, Jeff Haynes (percussion), and Rocky Fretz (piano). If you can keep your body still while listening to this one, you really need to loosen up a bit! \"Revelation\" is another favorite. It begins as a graceful duet for guitar and cello, later adding English horn, bass, and light percussion. A slow, tranquil flow creates a musical daydream. \"Maui Breeze\" is as light and refreshing as its title. Claytoven Richardson (vocals) and Jeff Oster (flugelhorn) also appear on this track. \"Shiva Grove\" is an east\/west jazz fusion with sax (George Brooks) and flute (Ravichandra Kulur) soaring over the chordal guitar foundation. \"Humility\" is the concluding bonus track, and is a duet for guitar and flute (Kulur). Also an east\/west fusion, it conveys gratitude and humility before \"the Source of Creation\" and brings this exciting album to a close.  Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"First I would like to say how I've loved Rob Zombie's music since I was a teenager. One of my first metal albums I ever bought was his first band White Zombie's 1995 album Astro Creep 2000 - songs of love destruction and other systhentic delusions of the electric head ( hope I got that album title right). So standards for metal albums were set pretty high as it was. So the latter ninties came and Rob Zombie goes solo putting out solid classics like Hellbilly Deluxe and the Sinster urge, hellbilly deluxe 2, venomous rat regeneration vendor ( which is one of my favorites) and my least favorite American Horses ( which shocked me with John 5 being his first album). So I was excited when I heard he was coming out with the follow up to venomous ratt regeneration vendor album ( which I though it was his best since the Sinster urge). The album finally comes and I  listen through the whole album all the way through and I have to say I wasn't really impressed the first time I heard it. So I listen to it on the way to work one day. All the way through again and it starts to grow on me. The songs are solid and catchy as hell. But the cool thing about the album is it's got sort of a classic rock vibe going on about it. Like some old Kiss records or old Alice Cooper records from the seventies or even Ted Nuggent. Only complaint I really have is there will be these solid songs that are awesome right next to songs to me are duds. John 5, Ginger Fish are awesome as usual. John 5 shreds and sounds amazing as always. I have had this album long so it may continue to grow on me and could become a Zombie classic one day in my mind. Still love Rob Zombie's music and movies. So glad there's a artist out there that's making original music and not making mindless drivel of pop and rap music right now. But in conclusion I think Zombie was trying to do something different and experiment a little bit with his sound. Which is totally understandable. Check it out if your a Zombie or metal or hard rock fan.","classification":3,"fold":9}

I'm 67 now and I love it. Music like this is timeless for those that love music.

{"text":"It's been almost seven years since Atlanta, Georgia's Sevendust have recorded with original guitarist Clint Lowery in tow. In that time, Lowery played in Dark New Day with his brother Corey and filled in as a hired-gun for Korn, before reconnecting with the band just in time for the release of 2008's,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chapter-VII-Hope-and-Sorrow\/dp\/B0013K1ALY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chapter VII: Hope and Sorrow<\/a>, which was recorded with his replacement, Sonny Mayo, in tow. Although Mayo helped keep the band pumping through nearly three album cycles worth of recording and touring, Lowery's absence was noticeably felt, and longtime fans will breathe a sigh of relief at his return to the fold with the band's eighth (!) album, \"Cold Day Memory.\"\n\nLike any good Sevendust album, \"Cold Day Memory\" kicks off with a bang. \"Splinter\" opens the album with some killer leads by Lowery (oh how we missed you) and the patented three-part vocal harmonizing between the guitarist, singer Lajon Witherspoon and drummer Morgan Rose. From there, the band keeps the energy going through tracks like \"Unraveling\" and \"Forever,\" which, at their heart, are classic Sevendust and sound like they could have been lost tracks from 2001's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Animosity\/dp\/B00005R5ZG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Animosity<\/a>. \"Karma\" finds the band simultaneously crushing and caressing with a killer breakdown that seems designed to incite a moshpit giving way to the soulful melodies of Witherspoon, only serving to show that they've still got it after all of these years.\n\nUnfortunately, the middle of the album doesn't quite live up to what the beginning promises. For the recording of the album, the band brought in producer Johnny K to help them reel things in and find their edge, and while it works in creating some truly memorable songs, they lose focus mid-way through and seem to fall asleep at the wheel. Things pick up a bit again with \"Nowhere\" and especially \"Better Place\" --a very Clint-centric song that will appease old-school fans - before capping off with the intense \"Strong Arm Broken,\" but the middle is perhaps the band at their most middle-of-the-road, and that's a bummer.\n\nMaybe if they had shaved off a few songs in the middle that just don't stick (\"Ride Insane\" in particular) \"Cold Day Memory\" would have been a tighter and more accomplished affair. Also, it wouldn't have hurt to let Clint into the spotlight a bit more. Afterall, this is his long-awaited return to the band, but it feels maybe like there was some apprehension about stepping on each other's feet. Something along the lines of \"X-Mas Day\" or \"Angel's Son\" would have helped add to the dynamic of the album and is something most of us have been craving for years now. I guess if you're looking for some Clint-tunes, his solo EP, \"Chills\" -- released under the Hello Demons, Meet Skeletons moniker -- will have to suffice for now.\n\nOverall, though, \"Cold Day Memory\" marks another exciting chapter in the band's history. Surely, there are more than a few songs here that will only help to intensify their live show and the album only goes to prove what we all knew all along: that Sevendust are at their best with its classic line-up intact. The CD comes with a bonus DVD that is worth picking up, as it features a documentary on the making of the album that goes beyond the usual fluff most bonus DVD's consist of. Even though it's not perfect, \"Cold Day Memory\" has enough to please any fan, and that's enough to recommend it to anyone reading this. Go buy the album, go see them live (where they truly shine) and continue to support the hardest working band on the scene.","classification":4,"fold":9}

They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.\n\nMezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.

What Now, the latest single from her Unapologetic record is not actually a really heartfelt song that could've been. I felt that she strained her heart and not really a great song that made you feel from the inner voice. I really found this song not to be a strong for her, and definitely not as good as what she had done with Ne-Yo several years ago on Hate That I Love You.

This rendition is my second favorite. Brown's intro and one exquisite chorus after another provides 21 minutes of sheer joy.\n\nAs I write this review the album is playing in the background. A single word comes to mind: serendipity. I had discovered this gem back in February while searching for something else, and immediately purchased it solely on the basis of Clifford Brown's participation. What a stroke of good fortune.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"It has been a very long time since we have had any new music from Corrine Bailey Rae. Hard to believe that it has been a decade since she broke big with her hit, \"Like A Star\" and \"Put Your Records On\" and she has been more cautious about trying to make as strong music as would be also with today's artists that have really chose to let the singles be heard first and not the album in full. Unfortunately, for Corrine that stride was put in sadness with the suicide death of her husband 8 years ago. She did come on strong with her second album, and songs like \"Paris Nights New York Mornings,\" which was deeply overshadowed in favor of more product singers like Rihanna and Beyonce'. Green Aphrodisiac, the lead single from her long-awaited third album, The Heart Speaks In Whispers, actually shows a bit more seductive side from Corrine as she tries and shows well, her intimate side with seduction and soul from the heart. It is a good song and shows a soft side of Corinne that works better from the heart, and shows she is just soulful from the voice alone. It is a good song, and worth the effort. Hopefully, there are more good songs like this one down the road from her.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","classification":4,"fold":9}

She's so pretty in the video for this song. Natural beauty and talent. Like Mariah Carey (although I'm an even bigger fan of Mariah's). I wish Sheryl continued to make good music but these days I don't think that's really happening anymore although she had a new album earlier in April.\n\nI miss her songs and wish dearly the quality of her tunes didn't peeter off.

{"text":"with all the shows out now from 1977, a fan might wonder if buying this show would be worth it. well, there are many reasons why the answer to that question is yes. 77 is widely regarded as some of the best recordings anyway, and after listening to this show i can say it's one of the better releases from this great year. a full, rich and warm sound that captures the energy nicely. in addition, there is no annoying heavy drum sound like some shows with two drummers. the set list is common from 77 but with a few surprises ;; 'dupree's diamond blues', 'iko iko', and a funny introduction by phil of the band,, he introduces them at the start of the second set as 'the jones gang' which kind of shows off the up beat vibe of the evening ... the big 2nd set jam is excellent, although somewhat unusual song selections which makes it fun; i'm not a big fan of the fast paced 'eyes of the world' but the 'estimated>the other one' is intense. also special mention to a sweet, 'stella blue', all wrapped in a 'playing in the band' that lasts almost the whole second disc. you can see the complete set list above, here on amazon. disc 3 is bonus cuts from 2 nights earlier which now gives fans quite a bit of offical music from 11\/77. the inside liner notes are cool also,, hand written notes by dick latvala, summarizing his feelings for the show and gives a historic feel to the packaging, really nice and a reflection i think of daves deference to dick and his long dedication and love for the band. all and all a nice 3 disc release that will be a welcome addition to anyones 1977 collection and one that should not be missed.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I just recently discovered Ghost through a youtube review of this cd. After listening to them on Spotify, I was thoroughly impressed. Full of harmonic vocals and heavy riffs along with well written songs, this is an enjoyable listen from beginning to end. 10 songs and a little over 40 minutes long, that's the biggest gripe with this cd. Especially since two tracks serve as intros\/interludes and are under a minute. The two biggest highlights come early with the hard hitting \"Pinnicle to the Pit\" and the prog influenced \"Cirice\" which also features a great hook. A low point for some may be the closer \"Deus in Absentia\" which kind of makes you wish the disc ended on a stronger note and the majestic \"He Is\" which pretty much serves as the album's ballad.

{"text":"Enough with the negative reviews on this cd. It's too different for the hardcore fans, etc., etc. It's too much like Christina Aguilera or Britany Spears, which is inaccurrate. You know, there was a time when a female artist could jump genres of music and receive accolades instead of dismissals. Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, Sinead O'Connor--all were able to shift gears musically, and to me that's a sign of talent, not selling out. Sure, Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover, the titles are written like Prince tunes (U & Me= Love, Run 2 U, Yes U Can), and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss. I, for one, find this cd to be one of Jewel's finest. She forgoes all the pseudo-serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads. However, she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in \"Stand\" and \"America\" along with other familiar themes of love such as \"Run 2 U\", \"Fragile Heart\" and \"2 Become 1\". She also deals with letting go and trying new things such as the first single \"Intuition\", which probably flew over most Jewel fans' heads. She even deals with lust on \"Sweet Temptation\", \"U & Me= Love\" and \"Yes U Can\". In fact, there are a number of hits on this disc: \"Stand\", \"Run 2 U\", \"Intuition\", \"Leave The Lights On\", \"2 Find U\", \"Fragile Heart\", \"Sweet Temptation\", \"Yes U Can\", \"America\" & \"Becoming\". The only true miss is the overlong \"Haunted\", which seemed out of place. This new direction is great--a breath of fresh air for Jewel. She sounds like she's having fun and the music represents that spirit. Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously. This could be Jewel's \"Thriller\" or \"Hysteria\" or \"No Jacket Required\". If you're looking for intelligent pop (which Aguilera and Spears are not), then pick this up (also if you like the 80's).","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"In his decade long career, Philadelphia native Musiq Soulchild has a great, if often overlooked, body of work. It all started with his 2000 debut \"Aijuswanaseing\", he crafted a stellar successful debut- despite his ties to Def Jam Recordings. Not that it was a bad label, but at the time Def Jam had a long history of underpromoting its R&B acts (Remember Alyson Williams, The Black Flames, Tashan, Playa or Case?). He followed that album up with his 2002 sophomore album \"Juslisen\" and a year later with the criminally underrated \"Soulstar\". While he was on the rise, his label was on the decline as far as promotion... so he wanted off the label. In 2006, he was placed in a unique label trade off between himself and rapper Fabolous-  with Def Jam's Musiq Soulchild going to Atlantic, while Atlantic's Fabolous went to Def Jam. After a four year hiatus, he resumed his career with his first album for Atlantic- 2007's \"Luvanmusiq\", followed a year later with the experimental \"OnMyRadio\". After laying low for a few years, he returned with his sixth recording, \"Musiqinthemagiq\".\n\nOne thing that's obvious about the record is the noticeable absence of his longtime producers Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias & Carvin \"Ransum\" Haggins. They have been replaced by Wyclef Jean's producing partner Jerry \"Wonda\" Duplessis, who produces much of the album- including the first single, the Swizz Beatz featured \"Anything\". Producer Lil' Ronnie produces the uptempo song \"Single\", a song about Musiq stuck in the dilemma of meeting an unattached woman while he's in a relationship. Swedish production team Element handles two songs- the ballad \"Yes\" as well as the 60's inspired \"Lovecontract\". On the track \"Dowehaveto\", Musiq tries to reason with a seemingly argumentative significant other and takes a woman to task who relegated him to being friendzoned on \"Befriends\". The album ends with its best song, the synth heavy \"Likethesun\". Overall, \"Musiqinthemagiq\" is another solid album from Musiq Soulchild- even if he seems content with taking the safe route and rarely stepping outside of his comfort zone.","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"Sultry soulful UK singer\/songwriter\/guitarist Lianne La Havas released her critically acclaimed debut \"Is Your Love Big Enough\" in 2012. Since then, she's become friends with, and featured on the last album of none other than Prince.\n\nHer new album \"Blood\" appears largely unaffected by that encounter, but different from her first. Largely gone is the light folky touch and in its place is a groovier heavier sound. Opening cut \"Unstoppable\" sets the tone for much of the album, a slice of dewy Marvin Gaye-esque soul. \"Who's that girl, and does the mirror world go on forever?\" she inquires on the horn-flecked \"Green And Gold\", lyrics that touch on the confusion her mixed heritage brought while growing up. With a voice capable of moving from a breathy whisper to a powerful belter as on the tender acoustic to fiery \"Grow\" or \"Midnight\" (laced with triumphant horns and hip hop beats), each of the ten tracks is special.\n\n\"Tokyo\" is a moody groove with heavenly harmonies and a mournful\/squealing guitar break, while the dreamy \"Wonderful\" is aptly titled, adorned with finger-snaps, sprinklings of strings and reverbed percussion. \"Never Get Enough\" is the surprise on the album, a delicate acoustic affair sporadically interrupted with bursts of fuzzy guitar and disembodied vocals giving an indie rock feel. Closing is the hymnal and folky \"Good Goodbye\".\n\nSends pleasant chills running through the blood. Another winner from La Havas.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I read a review that stated: \"Madame Palindrone fuses `90s acid jazz and `80s new age dance music with elements of modern day chillout, lounge, and progressive soul...\" and I certainly agree as I listen to this 11-track set.\n\nBecause of a lack of promotion for the truly talented soul\/r&b singers, I only discovered Deborah Bond via a video for SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS, a track from her debut album, DAYAFTER. The songs on this album display what is missed on radio today - melodic, rhythmic music with no HIP HOP beats and (oh my) NO RAPPERS!!!!  Music that features thinking, uplifting lyrics about love - for self, the world & others which is also sorely missing in music today (specifically the r&b genre). In addition to her unique vocal style, I love the fact that Deborah like Sade has her own backing band which I'm sure will help continue to create her signature sound.\n\nThis is a \"no skipping required\" collection that puts me in a good mood whenever I hear it and my favorite tracks are:\n\nIF I DIDN'T NEED YOU w\/ Lewis Taylor\nSAY IT\nNOTHING MATTERS\nBLIND PARADISE - funky arrangement with intelligent lyrics about the state of today's music industry\nPERFECT\n5:35\n\nI highly recommend this collection if your soul has been pining away for good r&b music, it is exceptional.","classification":5,"fold":9}

This is a total MC effort, each artist shines big time and the way TP laces his magic touch through out each and every song, while still allowing MC to blossom in to just one kick A#s band is like going back in time if you will. Songs like \"Trailer\" not a new song but sounding like one, \"Dreams of Flying\" up there with one of TPs greats, the magic of \"Beautiful Blue\" that just intertwines like nobody's business (ESPECIALLY ON THE  VINYL RELEASE, WOW!) AND SONGS LIKE \"Hope\" like it fell right off the Nuggets Box Set, the Other Side of The Mountain, sounding like Byrds\/Eagles early picking days if you will...and you also have 'Welcome To Hell\" a Benmont Tench song that sounds like Rockpile\/Nick Lowe style. And we also get the Mike Campbell rocker \"Victim of Circumstance\" that just smokes big time! \"Hungry No More \" closes this fantastic album! What an absolute masterpiece!!!!!

{"text":"September 22nd, 2009\n\n[...]\nAnyway, onto the song. It's not that bad really. It's better than Poker Face but not as catchy as LoveGame. But then again, it's not as annoying as either after repeated plays either.\n\nIt features a beat that could easily have been from the 90s and vocals that again, are OK but seem uninspired and like she doesn't really care to bring the song to life. I must admit though, I could tolerate hearing this on the radio sometimes like I could tolerate LoveGame. The chorus is pretty decent. It's not earth-shattering or anything, but it's really, really tolerable (which I didn't seem to notice during her VMA's perfomance). The only thing I could do without is the 90s beat. It almost feels like a Britney throwaway.\n\nBut yeah. For current top 40s stuff, it's not that bad.\n\n3.25 stars would fit it perfectly, but my final rating is a:\n\n3 stars.\n\nend note: Not that that's her style, but I would LOVE to see her try to do a big ballad. I'm sure she could pull it off and plus it would REALLY show off her voice which is usually buried in contemporary studio tricks and production gloss.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Christopher Cross \"(born Christopher Charles Geppert; May 3, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter from San Antonio, Texas. His debut album earned him five Grammys. He is perhaps best known for his US Top Ten hit songs, `Sailing,' `Ride Like the Wind' and `Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do),' the last of which he recorded for the film Arthur starring Dudley Moore. `Sailing' earned three Grammy Awards in 1981, while `Arthur's Theme' won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1981 (with co-composers Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen).\" Christopher Cross continues to give concerts to this day.\n\nThese five tracks available for download as MP3 files display Christopher's talent and artistry but I am disappointed that \"Arthur's Theme\" is not among them. \"Sailing\" has Christopher squarely front and center and his smooth voice never sounded better! Moreover, the musical accompaniment for Christopher's vocals couldn't have been any better; what a great songwriter he is! \"Think of Laura\" is very pretty even though the lyrics are somewhat bittersweet and \"Ride Like the Wind\" is brilliant! \"All Right\" just plain sounds good; this tune about a man trying his luck at love once again is catchy and Christopher Cross does this beautifully. \"No Time for Talk\" again highlights Christopher's gift for singing songs he wrote himself.\n\nFans of Christopher Cross will probably have these songs already; therefore this music is best geared toward the more casual fan who may just want to download one or two numbers. Indeed, these tracks are particularly good for people just discovering Christopher's genius. The omission of \"Arthur's Theme\" is a real disappointment; but I still recommend these five songs.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This song is part of the self-titled album released by this British group in 1982. Their musical style is best described as New Wave and Synth Pop. It is well performed and peppy. I remember it fondly from seeing and hearing the video on MTV. I read most all of the other reviews. The album cover art is the original design. There appears to be some dispute about the originality and quality of the recording. I have to say that the MP3 sound quality leaves a bit to be desired, which is why I give this only a 4-Star rating. Otherwise, I like the song, even though synth pop and new wave are not my favorite genres. However, this band performs their material very well. I find this song to be very interesting and entertaining.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"FOR EVERYMAN, along with the self-titled debut, LATE FOR THE SKY, THE PRETENDER, and RUNNIN' ON EMPTY, is one of Jackson Browne's best albums. There's a bit more rock here, including his version of his Eagles co-write, \"Take It Easy.\" This album is a must-own for any fan of California rock, Southern rock, or Midwestern rock. It's worth noting that Browne advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for community policing, so this is a purchase that's essential for your conscience, as well as your ears.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Well, I thought Jimmy Page said the Led Zeppelin re-master series was finished with Coda, but here we are. This time, the BBC Sessions album gets the deluxe re-issue treatment. As with the others, it includes previously unreleased material, in this case mostly from 1969. It includes the first official release of the song Sunshine Woman and a total of eight unreleased tracks (two versions of Communication Breakdown, two versions of What Is and What Should Never Be, Dazed and Confused, White Summer, I Can't Quit You Baby, and You Shook Me round out the third disc). If you already own the 2-CD version, you're basically paying for that third disc, along with the re-mastering of the first two. Or, if you're just a completist, to have all of the new deluxe editions. I'm glad to have it, and I'm glad Jimmy made it worthwhile by adding almost an entire disc of previously unreleased tracks. The packaging is in the same cardboard format as the other re-releases, with a really nice glossy booklet. The sound is typically excellent, having been personally produced by Page himself. Led Zeppelin was one of the best live rock bands ever, and this is a nice document of that fact.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Interesting to read the diverse range of opinions about the new TV on the Radio album, but I can't say I'm surprised. Anytime a band decides to go for a more full sound (some would say slicker) there will be the inevitable backlash and cries of \"sell out.\" But to my ears, this band is still progressing and taking chances ... and sounding better than ever. I love this sound.\n\nListening to these new songs I'm struck by the power and the energy, not to mention the strong melodies that abound. The band itself sounds tight and confident, clearly finding their sonic groove and locking in. For me, the brilliant \"Right Now\" is the highlight of the album, although I'm equally captivated by \"Lazerray,\" a thumping rocker that sounds like a great long-lost Ramones songs. I want to shout \"Gabba Gabba Hey\" every time it plays!\n\nIf you've been a fan of the other TV on the Radio albums, don't miss the chance to hear this new one too.

I did like her voice but really, I thought it was just gonna come and go.\n\nIn two ways, I was wrong:\n\nRadio played it quite a bit and once my mother got a hold of this song, she really, really, REALLY did NOT let go. She played it a lot and it grated on my nerves so bad, I started to \"hate\" this girl.\n\nBut fast forward some time and I say this is a good song made great because of the vocal force and runs that were perfected to a tee. Some say the lyrics are a bit juvenile and they kinda are overall, but the voice really does carry it over in this case.\n\nThe music to the song is good too but it doesn't compare to Lions, Tigers & Bears which also has better lyrics. If you have yet to hear it and have been ignoring radio, that's a good thing. But it's a bad thing if you haven't heard said song.\n\nFind it somewhere and dig in.\n\n4.25 stars = B","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"One of the very first hit songs from Fleetwood Mac back in their early days. Released back in 1969 as a single this is long before FM would be known for their mega-hit songs and album's. Rather this is old school FM when they were known as a blues band. The line up of the group includes Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan on guitars with John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. The song itself is an instrumental with a slow bluesy feel and mood to it. It is to me one of the loveliest songs ever produced by this band from their entire songbook.

{"text":"Somehow managing to be challenging, dramatic, funny, interesting, patriotic, reflective, touching, and more all at once, the musical sensation seems to have drowned in hype but just about every word is earned. This look at the life and times of Alexander Hamilton doesn't merely make for a great story. It's legitimately informative, and the ability to see the different sides of individuals often subject to simple portrayals is quite nice.\n\nAaron Burr in particular was an ambitious opportunist with fluctuating loyalties, to the point that he eventually explored taking up arms against the country that he'd previously defended. The musical doesn't let him fall into the role of a cackling, mustache-twirling villain. Instead, it takes a broader look at the man. Another selling point is the incorporation of soul music traditions, hip-hop stylings, modern pop vibes, and the like into standard show tunes. All that helps make the musical into something worth listening to over and over again. The album itself is truly a delight to have.","classification":5,"fold":9}

As others have said, it's epic without being \"too epic\" (if ever there is such a thing).  I've found extreme solace with this music at 3am when I can't sleep and need to paint some vivid but relaxing fantasies in my mind...or when writing (this has unofficially become the soundtrack to my novel)...or when baking bread on a Saturday morning (dough rises better with epic music)...and it goes on.  The quality and depth of sound is incredible, indicating that someone really cares for the music and wanted me to care, too.  The album is best listened to as a whole because there is a certain continuity to the music, but even when I listen on my MP3 player with all the tracks jumbled up and interspersed with other music, I can always tell Audiomachine from the rest.  Since falling in love with \"Tree of Life\", I've also purchased \"Chronicles\" and \"Epica\" and will invest in \"Helios\" sometime soon.  The sample snippets are a delicious teaser of what you get if you buy the whole thing, and if you're at all on the fence about this one, don't be!  It is the sort of music that wraps itself around your heart and takes your mind to incredible places.\n\nSeriously good music from a seriously awesome people.

This \"departure\" CODA struck all the right chords with me concerning the passing of a stellar mostly lately under-rated artist. More young people and typical modern\" country\" and\/or \"rock and rollers\" need to check out Glen's history and learn from a master. The man was an innovator and a foundation stone of American popular music. I remember watching the Glenn Campbell hour back in the 60s-70s and he always had the coolest acts, so it brought our family together in front of the TV on those nights.  9 times out of 10 my mostly traditional country music DAD would give a nod of approval to what we were listening to, simply because Glen had them on his show, that was a HUGE stamp of approval. Let me just ask you, what music program of the modern era (right now) brings families together like this? This was way before MTV so we didn't suffer from lack of video of our favorite up and coming artists in those days, thanks to Glen's vision. NO he is not a relation to me (that I am aware of) but every CAMPBELL in this family is proud and always loved Glen and not just for his name.

{"text":"In an earlier review of Horner's score for the movie \"Troy,\" I criticized the composer for heavily \"borrowing\" from his other works.  I failed to acknowledge that composers have singular orchestrations that separate their compositions from others in the field.\n\nA trained ear could recognize, without reading the credits, the music of Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, Miklos Rozsa, or Alfred Newman because each, respectively, possessed a sound that was unlike the other.\n\nAnd John Williams is no different.\n\nEven though there are strains reminiscent of themes used in the \"Star Wars\" series, \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" \"Hook,\" \"Jane Eyre,\" \"Superman - The Movie,\" as well as countless other William's works, there is enough that is \"new\" to make \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" one of the composer's best.\n\n\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\" is beautifully executed with a touch of whimsy while \"The Knight Bus\" is justly frenetic as is the on-screen drive through the streets of London.  \"Apparition on the Train\" is as ominous as it should be.  With its percussion intro, \"Buckbeak's Flight\" takes wing majestically.  Beginning with a celeste solo \"A Window to the Past\" is reflective and lilting.\n\n\"The Patronus Light\" awes, a la \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"The Dementors Converge\" is possibly one of Williams' most haunting compositions.\n\nAnd to top it off, the \"Mischief Managed\" compiles all the major themes into a twelve-minute example of why Williams is a multiple Oscar winner.\n\nAlas, the Academy didn't recognize him in this year's awards with the little golden guy.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This 25th Anniversary remake of We Are the world is a mix of good and bad. Most Acts brought their A Game but there are 4 main problems with the remake\n\n1. Janet Jackson's vocals - Either she's barely singing or she sounds so much like her late brother Michael. Either way, You can barely tell she's singing\n\n2. Akon was unnecessarily auto-tuned. I don't fault t-pain on this since it's his trademark\n\n3. Lil Wayne had a singing part. Faith Evans, Trey Songz, Jordin Sparks, Keri Hilson, Brandy Norwood, Gladys Knight, Natalie Cole, Anthony Hamilton, India. Arie, Jason Mraz, Melanie Fiona, and Musiq Soulchild are a few of the acts in the choir. Any one of them, especially Faith Evans would have been perfect to do this part. I saw An  interview With Lil Wayne where he even stated he couldn't even believe they wanted him to do Bob Dylan's part. So they should have used someone else.\n\n4. the rap - Excellent lyrics, however, All you can hear is LL cool J. This is where Lil Wayne should have had his part. Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz, Snoop dogg were in it also. But LL cool J's voice over powers everyone else. The rappers should have taken turns like the main singing acts.\n\nIt seems as if they wanted to have the current newbies, Strong voices, legends and hot young acts do most of the main acts, Hence why Justin Bieber opened (Newbie\/Hot young act), Barbra Streisand did Diana Ross' Part and LL cool J led the rap (legends).\n\nI know it's about helping Haiti but because we're buying a song to donate to Haiti, It's gotta be something people are willing to buy, so the We Are The World Foundation can actually give money to Haiti. And If People don't like it, They're likely to donate money to the Haiti relief elsewhere\n\nWith these 4 issues, it's not the great remake it could have been. Most Acts that were used brought their A Game but some acts were used incorrectly.\nHad Lil Wayne been replaced with a real singer, The rappers take turns rather than just LL cool J leading it, Janet's vocals been recognizable, And Akon not been-auto-tuned, This could have easily been a 5 star remake. They needed focus more on Talent than who's a current chart topper","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Lianne La Havas is a singer\/songwriter\/guitarist from the UK and her debut CD \"Is Your Love Big Enough?\" sounds just as lovely as her name. It's a blend of Soul, Jazz, and Folk, acting as a perfect backdrop to her feathery vocals which recall Erykah Badu or even Amel Larreux.\n\nThe album opens \"Don't Wake Me Up\" opening with a wall of multi-layered vocals before morphing into a spacey guitar-driven ballad. The title track is a guitar\/hand clap-driven affair, while \"Lost & Found\" is a piano ballad with quivery emotive vocals which would do Adele proud, as would the spare piano ballad \"Gone\". \"Au Cinema\" is a soft ballad with twitchy sounding guitar, while \"No Room For Doubt\" is a tender duet with Willy Mason. \"Forget\" features skittery percussion and the angry lyrics \"Waste all your time writing love songs, but you don't love me\", while the unfussy acoustic \"Age\" is a spare Jazzy\/Bluesy piece.\n\nEvery song stands out really; \"Elusive\" is a groovy ballad, \"Everything Everything\" is a lush Jazzy shuffle, \"Tease Me\" is an acoustic ballad, and closing is the catchy sunny \"They Could Be Wrong\", jangly Indie Pop with Havas tenderly teasing and caressing with her voice.\n\nThe album has already debuted at #4 in her native UK. Glad to see that good music can still find an audience sometimes. This album is an absolute delight!!","classification":5,"fold":9}

I put her way up there.  Nora has too much sameness and the song writing often isn't great.\nKat isn't comparable to anyone, doesn't fit in any genre really.  This will strike fans of her earlier two albums as more experimental, maybe even more pop.\nAll of her stuff has terrific musicians and arrangements.

{"text":"Richard Thompson is incredibly consistent, producing great song after great song and great album after great album, year after year.  STILL has 12 songs, and the Variations EP included with the Deluxe Edition includes 5 more.\n\nMy absolute favorite is \"No Peace, No End,\" a powerful anti-war rocker in the tradition of \"I'll Never Give It Up\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/SWEET-WARRIOR-2007\/dp\/B000OQDS18\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SWEET WARRIOR (2007)<\/a>.  If there was any justice in the world it would be blasting from the radio everywhere.  The other best songs, combining great music and lyrics, are the jaunty, cheerful \"Beatnik Walking,\" a tour of Amsterdam; the uptempo \"All Buttoned Up,\" about a frustrated lover; and the haunting \"Josephine.\"\n\nEven the weakest songs are not bad, not at all, just not as impressive as the others.  \"She Never Could Resist a Winding Road\" sets a wistful mood to open the album.  The uptempo \"Long John Silver\" might be about Bernie Madoff -- a financial pirate in any event.  \"Where's Your Heart\" features a cliche lyric with a moving chord change, guitar playing, and arrangement.  All of these songs play their assigned role in the overall flow of the album.  Thompson is a past master of the album form, an increasingly lost art in these days of MP3s and streamed songs.  I haven't moved on from the album, and neither has Thompson!\n\nThe remaining songs are all very strong.  \"Patty Don't You Put Me Down\" and \"Pony In the Stable\" are both angry songs by men aimed at women, the latter a rousing Celtic dance tune.  \"Broken Doll\" is tragic, and no one does tragedy better than RT!  \"Dungeons for Eyes\" would seem to have been provoked by meeting Dick Cheney at a cocktail party.  Perhaps an imaginary meeting.  In any event, a chilling, powerful song, another in a long line from Thompson aimed at the powerful and evil.\n\nThe last song on the proper album, the longest by several minutes, is \"Guitar Heroes,\" which shows that the old dog still has some new tricks.  It's a showcase for Thompson's guitar, playing solos in the style of Django Reinhardt, Les Paul, and several others.  Quite charming!\n\nThere's lots of fun to be found on the Variations EP.  The uptempo \"Fork In the Road\" sounds like something X-rated in the road the way Thompson pronounces it, which is half the point of the song.  \"The May Queen\" is another dark epic, as strong as many of the songs on the main album.  And the last song of all, the Celtic \"Fergus Laing,\" would seem to be about a certain obnoxious GOP presidential candidate -- \"Fergus has a fine head of hair when the wind's in the right direction.\"  \"He likes to build his towers high, he blocks the sun out of the sky.\"  Another great skewering of American right-wingers, a sequel to \"Sally B\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/ELECTRIC-2013\/dp\/B00AJLHU3K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ELECTRIC (2013)<\/a>.\n\nThe musicians include the stalwart members of Thompson's touring band, Taras Prodaniuk on bass and the great Michael Jerome on drums.  They sounded great live recently playing some of these songs!  Jeff Tweedy and Jim Elkington add guitars and other instruments, and Siobhan Kennedy, Sima Cunningham, Liam Cunningham, and Teddy Thompson add harmony and backing vocals.\n\nI can't agree with those who consider this to be \"Thompson's best album in years\" -- have they heard his recent albums?  I consider all of his recent albums to be great, from SWEET WARRIOR (2007) to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/DREAM-ATTIC-2010\/dp\/B003NYVYB4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">DREAM ATTIC (2010)<\/a>, which I consider his best of recent years, to ELECTRIC (2013).  STILL is not quite as good as the previous three, but it just gets better with repeated listening, and I can't give it less than five stars.\n\n--- --- ---\nThe production, by Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, is up to Thompson's fine standards.  Nothing fancy, very unobtrusive.  One thing I notice is that Thompson's guitar is placed front and center.  Right where it should be!  STILL was mastered by Bob Ludwig.  The 20-page booklet includes all the lyrics, including those on the EP.  The two discs and booklet are held in a triple-fold cardboard package.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The downward spiral away from music with any semblance of song structure continues. The God of Anger Pop, who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine, must have reached his seventh day of creation: for he is clearly resting on Ghosts. This is Reznor on a lazy day, bored with nothing better to do.\n\nGhosts I-IV is an organized chaos of happy (and angry and sad) accidents. I imagine a herd (or pod?) of Macs and samplers, pots and pans; left to their own devices, could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard. And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make.\n\nI admit that I'm still a pathetic hold-out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge. Thus, nothing less will ever truly satisfy. Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken. It's really not that bad, but it's just not that good. And for a small fistful of dollars, I shouldn't complain.\n\nI certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution (a la Radiohead's Rainbows) where the evil middle-man record company is kept out of the artist's and fans' relationship. I have to give kudos to NIN for fighting the good fight. So at worst, Ghosts I-IV will take up some precious space on your iPod. At best, it's harmless background noise. NIN Ghosts is a little haunting but definitely not scary.","classification":3,"fold":9}

The \"Unfinished\" gets a very good performance under Anton Nanut, who made a ton of budget-priced recordings for Naxos and others.\n\nI love the fact that one can listen to MP3's with good recorded sound when out on their morning walk or run. It drowns out the annoying people who feel the need to jabber on their cellphones at 7:30am, allowing us to loudly hear half of the conversation they're having.\n\nGreat music, great sound, good performances and an absolute bargain.\n\nRecommended.","classification":5,"fold":9}

This song reminds me not to be afraid to take chances in life to get what I want. \"It Aint Necessarily So\" is another surprise to me.  I love the guitar playing on this song.  This song sounds very bluesy and groovy.  Willie sings about characters and stories from the Bible in an unique way.  \"I Got Rhythm\" is an upbeat song that puts me in a good mood. \"Someone To Watch Over Me\" is my favorite Gershwin song.

{"text":"Yeasayer released a very much buzzed-debut album \"All Hour Cymbals\" in the Fall of 2007, and toured relentlessly. Now finally comes the highly-anticipated second album from the Brooklyn-based band.\n\n\"Odd Blood\" (10 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with a slightly tentative \"The Children\", although you can immediately sense that the band is diverting\/evolving from its debut album with more immediately accessible sounds. That comes forth in the next tracks, the danceable \"Ambling Amp\" and the even better \"Madder Red\". The first half of the album concludes with \"O.N.E\", another irresitable song. The first half of the album is far more 'mainstream' than anything on their debut album. The songs comes fast and furious, unleashing a soundscape not heard on the debut album, and sounding so much more confidant too. The second half contains several more highlights, including the urgent \"Love Me Girl\", the quirky \"Rome\", and the trippy \"Mondegreen\". But truth be told, there are really no 'weak' tracks on here, and at 40 min. the album clips by in no time, and you find yourself playing this again and again.\n\nIn all, this is a fantastic album, sure to make my 'best of' list at the end of the year. The growth from this band since its debut album is just amazing. I haven't seen these guys in concert yet, but will get an opportunity to do so when they play Coachella in a couple of months, and how I am looking forward to that. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear these guys, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that plays the best indie-music in the country, period. Meanwhile, \"Odd Blood\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The Ronettes were Phil Spector's  big group between the Crystals and the Righteous Brothers. Like most of the early sixties girl groups they were from New York  and first came to anyone's attention in a talent show, this time at the Apollo.  Unlike the Shirelles and the Crystals who were barely out of high school and had no real show business experience, the Ronettes had already been dancers in Murray the K's shows and had signed with Colpix Records as Ronnie & the Relatives, though without any chart success. After auditioning for Spector, at his advice they told Colpix they were getting out of show business to get out of their contract and immediately signed with his Philles label.\n\nSpector shelved their first proposed single, why Don't They Let Us Fall In Love, which is generously included here for fans who are interested in hearing these kinds of lost tracks. He was basically right in this case. It's a nice song, but not the kind of knock it out of the park single that starts a career. That was their first released single, Be My Baby which was not only a #2 charting single in the Fall of '63 but one of the great classics of the rock era. Phil Spector had his faults but he had a great ear for hits and skill in every step of making them.\n\nOf course they got the full Spector treatment with ample enough echo to make them sound like they were recorded in a cathedral, multiple backup singers that sometimes included the always dependable Darlene Love and sometimes Sonny Bono and his girlfriend Cher. Add to that the usual piano, drums including timpani, clapping and castanets, and and a backup band that sometimes included strings and you got a single that was practically an event. It was not for nothing that Spector's name was usually included with the Brill building composers he used; his production was part of the song writing process in which the original melody and words were just the basic material he built on.\n\nThe overall sound of the Ronettes was dyamic, positive and upbeat.  Even in a wishful song like Be My Baby, you know they'll get their guy.  The Ronettes look was unique, with their hair teased impossibly high and a generally exotic air. They came in toward the end of the Girl Group Era, which was cut short by the British Invasion.  The girl groups from 1964 on were new ones like the Shangri-Las and Dixie Cups. Only two of the earlier girl groups had hits after 1963: the Chiffons had Sweet Talkin' Guy in 1966 and the Ronettes had Walking In the Rain in the fall of '64. That song not only features the sound of thunder and rain but also an advanced stage in the development of the sound that Spector would find great success with the Righteous Brothers.\n\nmany of the Ronettes 1965 and '66 tracks are here, and they're all beautifully produced with great care. yet nothing happened for them after Walking In the Rain. Things were moving so fast and changing rapidly that by 1965 the early sixties girl group sound seemed old. it wasn't just the Ronettes, but every girl group who weren't having hits; the whole early sixties pop edifice vanished overnight with few survivors. The other part of the story comes from interviews with Ronnie and others who claim that Spector withheld many songs from release to keep the Ronettes dependent on him. Considering that Ronnie was practically being held captive in Spector's mansion, it's believable.\n\nNo matter what, these are all great songs and the disc is a winner all the way through. The EMI Legacy series has done a beautiful job with the sound, something that can't be overestimated in importance. These sound just like they should, with all the complex parts in their original balance. It makes all earlier Ronettes compilations obsolete. Be sure to check out their equally excellent Crystals disc.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Flatt Lonesome had a great debut CD. It is very hard to come out with a good follow up to a great CD like theirs In fact, the second CD is always a hard item for a group to put out.\n\n  Well, Too does not disappoint, they sound even tighter with all new material. Their Dobro player Mike really sounds great, coming out with some real melodious playing. Both Buddy's vocals and guitar playing have improved. This group plays with real great dynamics, not going full tilt all of the time, but doing some real nice playing with their instruments. Buddy has a couple of real nice guitar solos on this CD. Kelsi and Charli's vocals sound even better than before. I really like their harmony's on \"I Can't Be Bothered Any More\". Kelsi sounds great on the slow ballad \"Make It Through The Day\".\n\n  \"He Still Hears\" is a very good gospel song that is full of emotion. Their harmonies are so moving and intricate. Another great gospel song with great instrumental breaks is \"I'm Ready Now\". Mike tears it up on the Dobro and Buddy plays a hot guitar break. A song with a very catchy melody and great vocals is \"I Thought You Were Someone I Knew\", an upbeat heart break bluegrass ballad.\n\n  There is like a wow factor to this CD, really have not figured it out yet, whether it is the production or that sibling thing with Buddy, Kelsi and Charli. Maybe it is the excellent playing on the instruments. These are not studio musicians, these are the same young folk in the group, no one else. By the way ,you can really hear the Bass well on this CD and Dominic really plays some solid bass for the foundation. A lot of bluegrass groups add drums and percussion to their CDs. You don't need that, maybe that is why this is so special. This year it really looks like they are building some great momentum and a larger fan base on the long festival trek. That is hard work, These Bluegrass musicians are hard workers, plus it is hot out there in the afternoon when they do their first set. I can't see why this CD would not win some kind of IBMA award or even a grammy, it is excellent. Plus, these are all new songs, no cover songs, just new and original material. Paul Harrigill wrote two songs and helped out with another song. Sorry, I forgot to mention his excellent banjo pickin, He can play. Kelsi wrote a song and helped out with another one.

{"text":"MMG is back with their second album Self Made Vol 2, this time with a new member Omarion (formerly of B2k) . Self Made Vol 1 was a solid album which feauterd the singles \"Tupac Back\", \"Im A Boss\", \"Play Your Part\", \"600 Benz\" & \"Pandemonium\" . The album starts off with the 8 min track \"Power Circle\" feat Kendrick Lamar where everybody holds their own, then on \"Black Magic\" which is a Meek Mill song with Ross doing his typical repetitive hook that goes \"POOF there go the car \/ POOF there go the crib POOF\/ 100 million David Copperfield !\" . The standouts on here are \"This Thing Of Ours\", Fountain Of Youth\", \"Power Circle\", \"MIA\", & \"Bury Me A G\". The production is grat on here, I gotta give Ross his credit because he knows how to pick beats. I can see the die hard MMG fans loving this album but the average rap fan is gonna think this is decent at best. Wale is featured more than anybody on here, it would been good to hear more Stalley who only shows up on four songs. Its not terrible but its not classic either, this is summertime music. Alot of these songs are gonna dominate radio and tv like \"I Be Puttin On\" and \"Actin Up\" so you cant be mad at MMG for going the commercial route. Another thing is that the album sounds like it could be mixtape... That's just my opinion though.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nLyrics:\nWell you only need the light when it's burning low\nOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nOnly know you've been high when you're feeling low\nOnly hate the road when you're missing home\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\nAnd you let her go\n\nStaring at the bottom of your glass\nHoping one day you'll make a dream last\nBut dreams come slow and they go so fast\n\nYou see her when you close your eyes\nMaybe one day you'll understand why\nEverything you touch surely dies\n\nBut you only need the light when it's burning low\nOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nOnly know you've been high when you're feeling low\nOnly hate the road when you're missing home\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nStaring at the ceiling in the dark\nSame old empty feeling in your heart\nCause love comes slow and it goes so fast\n\nWell you see her when you fall asleep\nBut never to touch and never to keep\nCause you loved her too much and you dived too deep\n\nWell you only need the light when it's burning low\nOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nOnly know you've been high when you're feeling low\nOnly hate the road when you're missing home\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\nAnd you let her go\nAnd you let her go\nWell you let her go\n\nCause you only need the light when it's burning low\nOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nOnly know you've been high when you're feeling low\nOnly hate the road when you're missing home\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nCause you only need the light when it's burning low\nOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nOnly know you've been high when you're feeling low\nOnly hate the road when you're missing home\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\nAnd you let her go","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"For this soundtrack, don't think 80s, One More Time, or a new soundtrack masterpiece to cap off an already amazing year. No, think Inception-Lite, then add in some electronic beats. By Inception-Lite, I mean the music between soundtracks is kind of interchangeable, but there's clearly a more quality winner here. In fact, much of the soundtrack barrows from the Hans Zimmer school of thinking, not just the certain horn structure that was so infamously from Inception (The Game has Changed), but the strings, how the strings are arranged, the moods given off, etc. Granted, I know the soundtrack was composed before Inception ever came out, but the whole thing sounds very Zimmer-Esque.\n\nWhy is this? Well, the soundtrack may be \"by\" Daft Punk, but Joseph Trapanese did much of the orchestrations, with only the guidance of Daft Punk. Daft themselves did the electronic work. As a result, the work sounds very much like a modern soundtrack. But since Zimmer holds the example of the modern soundtrack currently in my mind, it sounds very derivitive of that for me. Not that this is a bad thing per say, but the entire score does hold an ever-present feeling of familiarity. It's mixed up by the electronic elements of course, which sound something straight out of a future nightclub, complete with weird DJ stuff, drumbeats and other tricks of the Daft Punk trade. Still, it doesn't sound amazing enough to stand on its own.\n\nAnother thing I must bring about is the theme. You know, the one introduced in the first track as a grandiose piece, comes back for a couple tracks at the beginning, then starting back with \"Arrival,\" dominates the rest of the proceedings. It's a rather simple horn piece, and it's used to great effect, but if feels like it also uses it as a crutch much too often. Introduction moment. Bring in the theme. Action moment. Bring in the theme. Emotional moment. Bring in the theme. Triumphant moment. Bring in the theme. End credits. Bring in the theme, remixed by Daft Punk. You see my point? It's a great and memorable theme, but it's a bit too simple to be as used as often as it is.\n\nOverall, Tron Legacy the soundtrack is not bad. It's a solid effort, but suffers from the stark feeling of familiarity wherever you go. Did it really take them two years to compose this? Still it's a must-have for soundtrack fans, and if it draws in non-soundtrack fans, then I'm fine with that too.\n\nOne thing I'll say though, if the soundtrack's job was to make you want to see the movie, then they certainly accomplished that.\n\n3.5\/5 Stars","classification":4,"fold":9}

I love the frenetic energy: the joyful bursts from the Earth Wind and Fire horns; the drums with all its little percussion minions - woodblocks, claves, drum machine tools; the hyper keyboard rhythms; the funky bass. It is a grooving, smart, well-crafted piece of music. Phil Collins is good at this kind of thing...but people often forget that he is a fantastic drummer, too. He's keeps the rhythm snappy and on point.\n\nMy only complaint is Phil's voice on dahnce with me, you never dahnce with me. That's a fairly minor one.

{"text":"\"Deep Purple\" was the biggest hit written by pianist Peter Derose.  The song was originally published in 1933 as a piano composition.  The tune became so popular in sheet music sales that in 1938 lyrics were added.  Several big bands of the day including Artie Shaw, Larry Clinton and Guy Lombardo to name but a few recorded the tune with varying degrees of success.  Then in 1963 Nino Tempo and April Stevens, a brother-and-sister duo from Niagara Falls, NY released their version.  It would prove to be the second most popular version of all-time and hit #1 on the pop charts in November 1963, just before President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.  Deep Purple also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock and Roll Record of 1963.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Flyleaf from the beginning, at least a year before their self-titled debut hit stores. It's hard to believe it's already been 4 years, and while the band has enjoyed quite a bit of success, we're only just now getting their sophomore effort. Flyleaf still sounds very much like themselves, the only subtle changes in this record is that it's a bit more polished and \"produced\" than their post-grunge debut album. I've really been enoying this album, but I was disappointed by the fact that it doesn't seem to be quite as strong as their first. On the last album, every song popped! It was one great song after another and each of them stood well on their own. However on this album, half way in all the songs seem to blend together and sound a bit too similar, especially since they're so short. Don't get me wrong, this album does have it's share of winning songs. \"Again\", \"Missing\" and \"Arise\" are some of the best songs the band has ever written, and some of the best tunes of the year. Other songs that I really liked were \"Chasm\", \"This Close\" and \"Swept Away.\" The whole album is good but most of the other songs just kind of run together. It's possible that over time I'll become more familiar with the album and my opinion will change, but I hope the group really steps it up when it comes time for album #3. Still, if you're any kind of Flyleaf fan then I think you'll really enjoy this, and it's still better than anything that Paramore has dished out.","classification":4,"fold":9}

There was much to do with this material and it all just comes across as monotonous.

{"text":"Having just been exposed to the music of Norman Brown,and only having two of his CD's it was only lucky this just happened to be the follow up to the other I had. In case most of you don't notice I tend to like to listen to two albums by the same artist one after the other,preferably follow ups so I can get an idea of their musical progression. Being a visual artist it really helps me to listen to music in this manner. Considering the largely instrumental jazz offerings of his previous album<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stay-With-Me\/dp\/B000NJL4WG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stay With Me<\/a>,it seemed more than appropriate that he would look to a more vocal and soulful approach on his follow up release. Considering the awkward way contemporary R&B was handled on that album,it seemed a creative gamble. But he actually made it work a lot better here.\n\n  The first three numbers \"Come Go With Me\",\"Thinking About You\",\"Here's My Number\" ,\"I'm Pouring My Heart \"and the title song are all funky,sleekly produced numbers-all of varying tempos and possessing grooves (and vocals in the case of the latter three) that are highly complimentary. All of them have a more R&B\/funk flavor than jazz rhythmically. But in a more late 70's\/early 80's mold than anything relating to the hip-hop cliches of urban contemporary R&B. My favorite number here is \"Playtime\",an uptempo horn packed salsa soul-jazz number with a strong melody to boot. The Sounds Of Blackness show up for a nice epic version of Kenny Loggins 70's soul standard \"Celebrate Me Home\" that's also of high musical and vocal quality of course.\n\n  The more traditional \"smooth jazz\" of \"Special Moments\" and \"Coming Back\",along with the more modern R&B style of the closer  \"One Last Goodbye\" are the weaker of the numbers here. But even here the strength and feeling of Norman Brown's playing never abandons him and he continues to keep the musical tide at as high a level as possible. The generally more soulful and festive atmosphere of this album showcases a possible new future for the pop jazz sound without the cliches of either smooth jazz or contemporary hip-hop based productions. There was absolutely nothing wrong with where things were going in the late 70's\/early 80's in jazz\/funk\/pop music. There was just the right mixture of slickness,instrumental ability,song craft and groove. And this showcases that,even in modern times those combinations can still work just as effectively.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"I've read a lot of positive reviews of this album, claiming that Coheed had ripped off Rush and Iron Maiden in their previous records, and that this may be the most \"them\" album yet. If that's the case, then I think Coheed should go back to ripping off Rush and Iron Maiden.\n\nCoheed are very talented, and frustratingly so. If anything, the first two albums are two of the greatest achievements in Prog Rock if you ask me. Then their third album came ad it was somewhat quite middling. A lot of good on there, a lot of decent, a lot of bad. Then the fourth, No World For Tomorrow... I don't think there were any memorable tunes on that disc. OK, I Liked the title track and Gravediggers and Gunslingers. And On The Brink was good too.\n\nWell, with this album, Josh is gone. In comes Chris Pennie, an extraordinarily talented drummer. A nice bloke too, I met him back in October. Also returning is the lack of any memorable songs. None of the tunes on this disc would rate above a 2\/5.\n\nI actually don't like any of the songs of this disc. As I stated, the highest I can give any of the songs is a 2\/5. Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it. The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live, and even that track sounds out of place, like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed. The best tune on the album, This Shattered Symphony, Has an amazing opening and chorus, but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus. Same thing with Guns of Summer, despite the awesome drumming. The Broken starts off awesome but quickly falls flat on it's face. World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying, and threw them into one song.\n\nI can't even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut, with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy. The intro to In The Flame of Error and the chorus rule but everything else is ruined by what ruins the whole album- Coheed having interesting parts of songs, then suddenly going off into a wild tangent. Hence the \"pretentious\" part. They're trying too hard.\n\nThen of course, what should be The highlight ofthe album is actually their worst song EVER, and may even be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It is essentially just noodling around for 7 minutes. Not even the bizarre and creepy coda at the end could redeem it. Here's the thing guys. I love heavy metal. I love electronica. I love Prog. I don't love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once, thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.\n\nAlso, the lyrics are disastrous. I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating. Here they've clearly taken a step back in that department. \"Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!\" ugh, seriously? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.\n\nLook, Coheed are much better than this. They have TALENT. They can actually write tunes. They can explore their creativity in ways no other modern band can. But this album just bores me. I sincerely hope they can make a comeback with their next disc.","classification":1,"fold":9}
{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely sad that someone who has the talent, just has not even shown it has the pipes to show for it. Nicki MInaj, who has been out there for the past several years, just has not even came close to having the songs to show for it. Sadly, with the lackluster performance from her latest album The Pink Print, she really has lost her ability to make better for her own voice, and her strength in songs as well. Her latest song does fair a little better, but not much than her wasted collaboration with Chris Brown and Lil' Wayne among others, Only. The Night Is Still Young is just Nicki and honestly she does a better job at putting her rapping skills into the songs. Still, Nicki has a lot more to find to make better work than rushing out songs like she did for The Pink Print. It isn't a bad song, but not potentially her best. Hopefully, more to make while the night could still be young.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Before Adele. Before Andra Day. Before Alessia Cara. There was Corinne Bailey Rae. Her angelic voice is strong but soft, sentimental without being overemotional.  Her first album was a walk through the grass, barefoot on a sunny day. Her follow up, was dark like waiting for a storm to pass. It took six years to put together her third album, The Heart Speaks in Whispers, which for CBR fans feels like a lifetime.\n\nLast we saw Corinne, she was washing her pain away in the sea. She had just lost her husband and her life had hit a standstill. Now, she has recovered and is happy as evident throughout The Heart Speaks in Whispers. She is clearly in love again with heartfelt songs like Horse Print Dress, Been to the Moon and Green Aphrodisiac. She opens up on Hey, I Wont Break Your Heart. The ballads, Do You Ever Think of Me? and Night have lyrics like a young Stevie Wonder. The deluxe edition has four more songs including the sultry In The Dark, the best ballad of the album High, the disappointing Ice Cream Colours, and the standout Push On For the Dream.\n\nIt is good to see CBR happy again. Its easy to forget about Corinne Bailey Rae being that she only puts out albums once every 4-5 years. Such an absence could have been a risk to her career, and maybe it did hold her back from superstardom after such a hot start; however Corrine is an artist who is fueled by emotion. She does not waste time with metaphorical tales of hypothetical situations. Whatever she is feeling at the time, whether happy, sad or angry, that is what she brings to each album. Sometimes such emotions take time to express. Core fans can appreciate this because she continues to put out consistent, quality work. While she may not gain new fans with The Heart Speaks in Whispers, Corinne Bailey Rae continues to build an extraordinary body of work as the most underrated, underappreciated, and undervalued artists of the past decade.\n\nTop 5:\nGreen Aphrodisiac\nDo You Ever Think of Me?\nPush On For The Dream\nHigh\nHorse Print Dress","classification":5,"fold":9}

His latest collects songs written and recorded over a four-year period, mixing rock, blues, rockabilly, folk and country. Lee still sings well, but it's his guitar - both electric and acoustic - that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Whether he's blistering through a hard-rocker, playing a shuffle or Bo Diddley beat, riffing on the blues, or fingerpicking folk-country, Lee's playing shines in both rhythm and extended solos. Lee closes the album by revisiting \"Love Like a Man\" in a style that leans more to NRBQ than Ten Years After. A sweet acoustic bonus track is hidden at disc's end, providing a restful capstone to an album full of energy. [2012 Hyperbolium]","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"The self-titled release by the Atlanta based band, Theocracy first appeared in 2007 but has been out of circulation since that time.  For several months, fans have long-awaited for the release of Theocracy's original album - an album that has been remastered and remixed.  On November 19, fans around the were were thrilled to listen in to Matt Smith and the boys hammer out their unique style of Stryper meets Dream Theater heavy metal music.\n\nTrack by Track:\n\nAfter a 80's-like keyboard intro the album begins with a double-base drum anthem that celebrates victory in Christ.  Here's a few lines from Ichthrus.\n\nForced into the catacombs\nunite to praise the King of kings\nthey fear a revolution\nand the power that He brings\nheaven's sons stand as one, as believers\nin the blood of Christ\neven in death we have true life\n\nCENTURIES FLY\nBUT THE FLAME IS STILL ALIVE\nTHE MAY HIDE IT, BUT IT WILL NEVER DIE\nCARVED IN OUR SOULS,\nSEE THE TWO HALVES OF THE SIGN\nTHROUGH THE AGES HIS GLORY WILL ARISE\nFOR ALL TIME\n\nThe Serpent's Kiss begins as a ballad and speaks candidly about the curse of sin that has been inflicted on the cosmos.\n\nBorn into the darkness\nthrown into the viper's den\nthe serpent in the cradle\ntakes the child into its nest of sin\nslowly suffocating\nthe souls of victims it has found\ninto the vicious cycle\non the path that only leads us down\n\nRat-race-fueled machinery\nthis system of corruption\nhave we become so cold and numb\nwe're blind to its destruction?\nWe're forging in the fires made of greed\nOur idols made of gold\nthen bowing down before them\nwith corrupt, adulterous souls\nopened eyes,\nrealize...\n\nWHAT WE HAVE DONE\nWHAT WE HAVE SEEN\nWHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR LIVES\nCORRUPTED OUR DREAMS\nWHAT WE HAVE LOST\nAND WHAT REMAINS\nPARALYZED BY THE VENOM THAT RUNS THROUGH OUR VEINS\nTHERE'S GOT TO BE MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS\nTHE WORLD'S CARESS IS JUST THE SERPENT'S KISS\n\nBut the venom that has plagued mankind has been defeated by the power of the cross.  So the song continues ...\n\nI stand before you as a child\nby this world I've been defiled\nstained and poisoned, burned and beaten\nbruised and wounded, sick and vile\nwith hands reaching out to you, I run\nrealizing what I've done\nyou take me in your arms, a reunited father and son...\n\nThe song is not only a powerful reminder of the gospel but also leaves listeners with a permanent and painful warning:\n\nAnd all illusion ceases to exist\nthe world's caress is just a serpent's kiss\n\nMountain paints a vivid portrait of the journey that every Christ-follower faces.\n\nStep by step the climb gets harder\nmy being weakens as I struggle farther and farther\nflesh is weakness, darkness, sickness\nmy dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled\nmy will defeated, my spirit humbled once more\nI am hopeless, helpless without you\n\nThe tune resembles John Bunyan's classic work, Pilgrim's Progress and leaves listeners with hope as they plod their way through the Christian life:\n\nTake me to the places I can't go\nTranscending\nI'm sick of living in the status quo\nNew Beginning\nAnd when it seems I've given up\nOn eagle' wings you life me up again\nand this time I know, in the end\n...You carried me\n\nThe title track, Theocracy is a metal dream that challenges every listener with the direct claims of Christ's lordship:\n\nAt the center of my heart there sits a throne\nThat the rightful occupant's not always\nfree to call His own\nFor how can I give the King\nHis place of worth above all else\nWhen I spend my time striving\nto place the crown upon myself?\n\nThe chorus hammers the lordship theme with a holy vengeance:\n\nI TAKE MY CROWN AND CAST IT DOWN\nCASTLES BURNING\nCASTLES BURNING\nLEARN TO GROW, GROW TO BE\nA FLESH AND BLOOD THEOCRACY\nTO TAKE THE LOSS AND BEAR THE CROSS\nRAISE THE KINGDOM\nRAISE THE KINGDOM\nBURN AWAY ALL IVE BEEN\nTO RESURRECT THEOCRACY WITHIN\n\n2 Corinthians 10:5 is employed to remind Christians to submit every thought to the lordship of Christ:\n\nand the would-be rulers of my heart\nthat I place upon the throne\neach lead the kingdom of my life to ruin\nto bring every though into submission\nto tear the idols down\nis to break the chains, to rearrange,\nto give the king his crown\n\nThe Healing Hand is a powerful five-part masterpiece that begins with the prophecy of the Messiah - the hope of nations.  The tune leads listeners from the cradle to the Cross of Christ where the \"healing hand becomes the bleeding hand.\"\n\nHis kingdom forever, the Lion of Judah in strength\neverlasting redemption, atonement complete\nresurrected in power, as King now he stands\nFOR THE BLEEDING HAND HAS BECOME THE RULING HAND\n\nFaith-born forever, a part of His kingdom become\nOr reject him, stand back\nand watch his kingdom come\nAlpha and omega almighty is he\nChrist reigns victorious for eternity\nEternity\n\nSeveral more songs grace this stunning album.  There is simply too much to share in a short review in this format.  But suffice it to say, this piece of work by Theocracy is about as good as it gets.  The music is tight, the production is crisp, and the vocals are spot on.  Again, as I have noted elsewhere, Matt Smith is one of the premier songwriters of this day.  For whatever reason, he has gone largely unnoticed - a tragedy in its own right.  This young man should be commended for his God-given gifts.  But as every God-fearing man recognizes, all the glory goes back to the Giver of every good gift.\n\nThanks to Matt Smith and the band for writing such God-honoring music; heavy metal music that truly honors the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifies his gospel!","classification":5,"fold":9}

It is very good, even though a version released in 1990 has more appeal to some folks. It doesn't really matter that much. Any of Lee's versions of this wonderful song will bring the message across.

{"text":".\n\"And if our love was meant to be, hey, girl, find a way to save it.\" -L.T.D., featuring lyrics by Jeffrey L. Osbourne & Sam Dees\n\nFive EMOTIONAL Stars. While he was still with the group \"L.T.D.\" (Love Togetherness & Devotion), singer, songwriter Jeffrey Osborne demonstrated he was one of the greatest lead voices in soul and R&B, although he was soon destined to leave L.T.D. after a decade to start a brilliant platinum-selling solo career. Here he sings his tale of a man trying to get back with his girlfriend, wanting to know \"Where Did We Go Wrong?\". L.T.D.'s background harmonizing blends wonderfully with Jeffrey's distinctive and heartfelt voice, especially with those long breathless notes. This is a fantastic soulful ballad that gets My Highest Recommendation. Five WONDERFUL Stars. (A&M records. 1-MP3 track. X-Ray lyrics. Time-4:28.)","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"When you have a hit as monstrous as the disco-tinged \"Believe,\" do you even dare change the formula, even slightly?  Cher doesn't, and that's not a bad thing on \"Living Proof.\"  As with her last record, the diva gives us a platter of energetic dance tunes that may not be as memorable as \"Believe,\" but are catchy enough to find a home in both the radio and the clubs.  I wasn't totally wild about the first single \"Song for the Lonely,\" a 9\/11 tribute that sounds less sincere than opportunistic.  She fares way better on \"A Different Kind of Love Song,\" \"The Music's No Good Without You,\" and the bouncy \"When the Money's Gone.\"  But \"Living Proof\"'s best track is the discocentric \"Love Is a Lonely Place Without You,\" a really good post-breakup song that's given justice thanks to Cher's distinguished delivery.  On her last album, Cher asked us to \"believe.\"  This time around, she's given us the \"living proof\" to show that our faith wasn't in vain.","classification":4,"fold":9}

I like Moves Like Jagger and Payphone... but most of his other stuff just doesn't click.\nThis on the other hand, is something else entirely...\n\nIt's such a sad song. A song that seems to have such little hope for the protagonist (I'm not sure what they're called in songs). She will Be Loved is about a guy who loves a girl who has some sort of issue. Either she is mentally unstable? Used by other people in wicked ways? Etc. This scenario dooms the protagonist to this longing for a person who he will never get... because she can't respond. Not that she won't. She CAN'T.\n\nIt's a very sad song that has little hope.... but that's life. It doesn't always turn out great for us, and this song reflects that. It has a great tune to it that sounds like the protagonist's fate. Adam Levine has a great unique voice that brings home the lyrics. And the story itself (a plot worthy of a book, i should add) is heartbreaking.\n\nBuy it... but don't expect a happy ending, lol","classification":5,"fold":9}

If these songs were the demos (or prototypes if you will), think of what they would've sounded like if they were refined and produced in the studio!  Someone actually complained of how these songs were, among other things, out of tune and unpolished.  Well, what did you think they were?  That's why they're called HOME RECORDINGS!  Think of them as first drafts to potential songs.  In fact, I think \"Home Recordings\" is far more enjoyable than the Green Album and Maldroit combined!  \"Home Recordings\" is definitely worth buying, in my opinion.

{"text":"Uncle Kracker's \"Smile\" is one of those quirky songs that does not come along too often, but when it does, it leaves a memorable mark on the listener.  The melody is pleasant and upbeat and the type of song that anyone would enjoy singing along to.  And most importantly, the lyrics are extremely poetic, especially the chorus:\n\n\"You make me smile like the sun\nFall out of bed, sing like a bird\nDizzy in my head, spin like a record\nCrazy on a Sunday night\nYou make me dance like a fool\nForget how to breathe\nShine like gold, buzz like a bee\nJust the thought of you can drive me wild\nOhh, you make me smile...\"\n\nIf there was an antithesis to Daniel Powter's \"Bad Day,\" \"Smile\" is indeed the song.  And also falls within the same vein as Colbie Caillat's \"Bubbly\" and long list of other songs that simply adds a sparkle and step to one's day.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Some Great Reward is an amazing mid 80's release and has tracks People are People, Master and Servant that all shot up to the top of charts all over the world. This album also has strong non single tracks like lie to me and something to do. They are much more experimental then their critics ever give them credit for and the sounds used on Some Great Reward and Construction Times Again are not even remotely the same.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set. The recording of the piano quintet was enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it. There is a lot of other great music on this box.

{"text":"This CD shows two things, one the brilliance of Bloomfield's playing and two, just how far he had fallen as a result of his Heroin addiction.  After nine hours of recording, Bloomfield and Kooper completed Bloomfield's \"Albert's Shuffle\", \"His Holy Modal Majesty\" and \"Really\", Howard Tate's \"Stop\", and Curtis Mayfield's \"Man's Temptation\". At the completion of these first five tunes, Bloomfield packed up his things and abruptly left the studio. Kooper wanted to complete the recording so he picked up the phone and called Stephen Stills.  Still's agreed to finish the sessions.  As such you get two very different sounding recordings here.  The first half--Kooper and Bloomfield which contains some very nice blues and classic Bloomfield guitar. The last half features Kooper and Stills complete with jangly guitar and Buffalo Springfield like vocals.  The disc is rounded out with some added bonus material featuring remix versions of \"Albert's Shuffle\" and \"Season of the Witch\" without the horns and two others. An added bonus is \"Fat Grey Clound\" which is a masterpiece in itself.

{"text":"`Year of the Black Rainbow,' is a fine album indeed, maybe a little different than some may have been expecting but of undeniably high quality, in terms of superb songwriting, outstanding musicianship and a production job that feels almost like an instrument unto itself.\n\nI can imagine that the band may lose a few fair weather fans with this album, but those who remain will find a wholly enjoyable album that gets better with each listen.\n\nCoheed and Cambria are not a band you could ever accuse of stagnation. Perhaps `Departure,' is too strong, but this album is certainly different, the album seems to make a conscious effort not to sound too much like 2007's `No World For Tomorrow,' album, eschewing the slick almost overproduced sound and bright tones for an almost industrial sound, with more electronics, flatter tones and an abundance of samples, electro drums, odd guitar tones and vocal effects.\n\nDrummer Chris Pennie is a perfect fit for this band, and fits perfectly with the band's established drum style on songs like `World of Lines,' and `The Broken,' but adds a whole new flavor to the excellent almost drum solo quality `Guns of Summer,' and `In The Flame of Error,' which are at times unlike anything you've ever heard on a Coheed album before.\nThe songwriting also seems to be more in line with the band's work before Good Apollo than after, but all the new tones, sounds and Claudio's vocals stop this from sounding like a rehash of new ideas, but rather a new era of Coheed all together.\n\nLyrically, the album seems to be a lot more personal than the previous two albums and features barely any reference to place names, character names, or words like `Prise,' `Mon-Star,' or `Key Frame,' this may please some sections of the fans and upset others, but given the quality of the lyrics and vocal performance few will be disappointed in any serious way.\nHighlights include the fast potential single `World Of Lines,' the drumming masterpiece `In The Flame of Error,' and the superb semi-ballad `Pearl of the Stars,' which features some brilliant unusual percussion, beautiful guitar work and possibly Claudio's finest vocal performance to date, switching between new low pitched vocals and his traditional style to great effect.\n\nOverall this is a superb Coheed and Cambria album and rewards repeat listening; the new drummer, the very noticeable production and the new lyrical approach keep the album very fresh.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Uptown Special\" is producer Mark Ronson's fourth album and is a throwback to eighties funk\/soul\/jazz, featuring lyrics by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon on about half the songs. It could have ended up sounding pretentious but thankfully turns out rather well.\n\nOpening the album is the brief intro \"Uptown's First Finale\" with Stevie Wonder on harmonica, followed by the dreamy jazzy ballad \"Summer Breaking\" featuring Tame Impala's Kevin Parker. The feverish horn-sprinkled \"Feel Right\" sounds like James Brown walked into the studio and features rapping by Mystikal. \"Uptown Funk\" is the current US and UK #1 single, a horn-peppered Prince-meets-MJ affair with Bruno Mars on vocals and Nile Rodgers-style scratchy guitar. The skittery funk \"I Can't Lose\" features a raspy Keyone Starr (the lone female lead vocalist) and recalls Kashif's work in the mid eighties.\n\nThe groovy \"Daffodils\" features the dreamy falsetto of Kevin Parker and a fuzzy guitar break, while the brief atmospheric ballad \"Crack In The Pearl\" features the vocals of Andrew Wyatt (from Swedish trio Miike Snow) and the opening lines \"In the Backroom of the El Mago Casino, under a portrait of Doris day, you and I, and a pair of C-notes\" - Chabon at work. \"In Case Of Fire\" is Prince-meets-Stevie Wonder with the vocals of Jeff Bhasker and a trippy coda.\n\n\"Leaving Los Feliz\" is sleek pop\/funk with Kevin Parker, \"Heavy And Rolling\" is a sublime groove featuring Andrew Wyatt and a jazzy coda, while closing cut \"Crack In The Pearl Pt. II\" starts off sounding like a Ray Parker Jr. jam with Stevie Wonder again on harmonica and Jeff Bhasker on vocals as the song meanders through different trippy movements.\n\nMy only complaint is the brevity of the album. After producing hits for Robbie Williams, Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse, it's great seeing Ronson's enjoy his moment in the sun. Don't believe him? Just watch","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Wow, this year has been so good so far. We've had many amazing albums this year, including this one from Breaking Benjamin. This album was created from the ashes of various legal problems that happened during the first part of the decade. Whether it be Benjamin's health issues that rendered him unable to tour, or the problems with the greatest hits album that caused two former members to be fired, it seemed like this band would never come out of their rock they were hiding in. And they did, when Ben brought in four new members, including people from Red and Adelitas Way, and a year later, this album was dropped.\n\nI've heard a lot of different opinions about this album thus far, some people thinking that this is more of the same, and others thinking that this is an absolute godsend. As you can tell by the five-star rating, I'm with the group of people who thinks that this is a godsend, and I'll explain why. Yes, this is not much different from their previous material, and it seems like on a few songs they were inspired from previous hits, but there seems to be a spark in this band this time around. This doesn't need to have the most radical progression in order to be a great album. In fact, I can safely say that Breaking Benjamin is one of those few bands that can still be making the same album in 2040 and still feel fresh.\n\nOf course you've already heard the song \"Failure\", and to those who actually listen to the radio, you've probably heard this ad nauseum, but it's because this is a very great introduction to this album. There's also other Breaking Benjamin anthems on here such as \"Bury Me Alive\", \"Never Again\", \"Defeated\", \"Hollow\", and \"Close To Heaven\", that are equally as fantastic, some of these even better than \"Failure\". I think \"Defeated\" has to be my favorite out of these, even though this is an album where it's really hard to choose. But, there are also moments where they offer some differences, such as in \"Breaking The Silence\", which reminds me of songs like \"Sugarcoat\" from their first album \"Saturate\", merged with the more recent BB output. And then there's the all-soft song \"Ashes Of Eden\", which has already garnered a lot of praise, even from people who don't like this album that much. And it's because it's a fantastic song that is more heartfelt and passionate than any of their other ballad tracks I've ever heard.\n\nOverall, I'm going to go an extra mile, and give this album the full 100 score. Because, this album is a comeback album that fans really desired, and now they finally have it. We're going to have a hard time finding out if this album or Red's \"Of Beauty And Rage\" is the Album Of The Year so far, because I think they're both pretty much on par with how amazing they are. I mean, we have a new Deftones album coming out in September, and that's really going to make this all the more challenging to decide. So, anyway, I recommend this album highly. I was so excited for this album that I actually pre-ordered the vinyl edition, and I'm going to Best Buy today to pick this album up. I suggest you do the same.\n\nRating: 100\/100","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Imagine Dragons is an indie-band out of Las Vegas, and on the basis of several well-received EPs, in particular the \"Continued Silence\" EP from early 2012, there has been a buzz building around this band. If you are unfamiliar with their sound, think the Killers-meet-Coldplay, as incomplete a comparison that may be. This is the band's debut full-length studio album.\n\n\"Night Visions\" (11 tracks; 44 min.) starts off with \"Radioactive\", one of the band's best songs, period (also one of 3 songs reappearing from the Continued Silence EP, along with \"Demons\" and \"On Top of the World\"). Even though this is the band's debut album, they seem to have one thing on their mind: to have a sound so big that it screams \"arena-sized\". Check out \"It's Time\" as a good example. \"Demons\" take a cue from latter day-Coldplay. \"Amsterdam\" is a more reflective tune (and NOT a cover of the Peter Bjorn & John track of the same name). \"Hear Me\" is a great track (it originally appeared on the \"Hell & Silence\" EP from 2010. \"Bleeding Out\" is a slowburner that builds to a massive song. It all works towards the epic album closer \"Nothing Left to Say\/Rocks\".\n\nIn all, \"Night Visions\" is a pleasant debut album, nothing more, nothing less. I have to say I am really surprised how much attention this album has been getting (including here on Amazon, closing in on 200 reviews already!).

{"text":"Is this remixed??  I had the original CD from 2013, which WAS tough to acquire in stores because of the original label's distribution channels...and I fell in love with it, for Brandy's fun, sly wit, great voice, melodic progressive alt-country in trad-country clothing and understated delivery which set up the lyrical punches all too well.  BC deserved the Grammy nods 100% for this masterful \"12 Stories\", which is exactly what it is.  Now, I recently came across the fact that this disc was reissued by Warners recently, with a new deal, highly deserved, probably because of the Grammy nods, as well as the sales and buzz on the indie release...good, as it will make this disc easier to acquire for newbies.\n\nNow, I have to admit that I'm a sucker for reissues, espesh on Warners...it looks the same as the indie one but I would feel funny having the indie one, knowing it's on Warners now...so I rebought the reissue...and 2 things struck me right away.  I don't recall there being a lyric sheet in the indie CD...even better because these 12 story-songs pay off reading them as well as listening.  Upon hearing the reissue, it sounds REMIXED, and in the best way possible.  The original CD's production sounded a bit plain and underwhelming, which was OK as it focused on the lyrics.  This new mix was much more colourful and dynamic, as you heard instruments and production touches at the forefront, like bells, guitar riffs, drum brushes, etc, which only enhance the songs and never overpower Brandy's voice and songs.  \"Stripes\" and \"Illigitimate Children\" are just 2 songs that benefit from the new mix.  I loved the original CD but this new mix floored me and enabled me to hear the songs in a whole new way, a fresh way.\n\nIf anything, the album sounds even better this time around...and it cements \"12 Stories\" as a modern classic and Brandy Clark as one of the brightest singer\/songwriters around today, even if she denies it...if she wins Grammys, great, but just being nominated is enough to cement her cred...a long career as a writer and singer is her's for the asking.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Compton\" is Dr Dre's third album, inspired by the hit NWA biopic \"Straight Out Of Compton\", and replacing the scrapped album \"Detox\". It comes some 23 years after his debut \"The Chronic\" during which period various musical styles and rappers from Snoop, Eminem (\"Still got Eminem checks I ain't open yet\" Dre raps on \"Talk About It\") to Kendrick Lamar have come up. All (and more) appear as guests on a number of the tracks, each bringing something vital to the game. It's a cohesive work with a laid-back groove of subtle variety, and lyrics touching on race issues, crime, violence, and nostalgia.\n\nIn an album that implores one to listen all the way through, a few highlights include the \"Intro\" (a brief historical\nnarrative on Compton), the breezy soulful groove \"It's All On Me\" (featuring Justus & BJ the Chicago Kid), \"All In A Day's Work\" (featuring Anderson .Paak & Marsha Ambrosius), the piano-sprinkled \"Darkside\/Gone\" (featuring Marsha Ambrosious and Kendrick Lamar), the rock-laced \"One Shoot One Kill\" (featuring Snoop Dogg and Jon Connor), the angry horn-peppered \"Just Another Day\" (featuring Asia Bryant), the gentle almost jazzy \"For The Love Of Money\" (featuring Jill Scott, Jon Connor, & Anderson .Paak), the eerie \"Satisfaction\" (featuring Snoop Dogg, Marsha Ambrosious & King Mez), \"Animals\" (featuring Anderson .Paak and the poignant line \"Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes, I ain't living in fear, but I'm holding him tight\"), \"Medicine Man\" (featuring controversial misogynist lyrics by Eminem, as well as Candice Pillay & Anderson .Paak), and closing nostalgic cut \"Talking To My Diary\" on which Dre has the final word (and what an enchanting horn coda).\n\nAt 50, and with close to a billion dollars in his account, Dre has nothing to prove (proceeds from the album will fund a performing arts facility for young people in Compton), yet still pushes himself to spectacular effect. NWA had a lot to say about the state of society back then. Dre comes back to show not much has changed since then.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Well, folks, we seem to have passed some great cultural milestone. Because when the rabid Bill Donahue appeared on Fox News yesterday, he seemed to debut a new approach or tactic on his part in how to deal with gay people in general, and gay artists particularly. Donahue clearly was aiming to appear very relaxed and with-it. And though he was there to complain about some statement by the artist about Catholicism, and particularly because it came during Holy Week, his general strategy was clearly a new one.. His complaints are hardly news, since that is what he does. But the fact that he spent a large chunk of the interview opining about Lady Gaga's obvious talent surely is news. Apparently the tech people on the Fox News Channel are Lady Gaga fans, because Donahue emphasized that he had been talking of the singer's talent in the green room with them, so bubbling over with appreciation for cutting edge gay singer stylings that it takes over his small talk no less apparently. So, I am not sure what this milestone means, but it means something. Perhaps a clue might be found in the fact that he further explained that Catholics just want to be \"left alone\". Well given that the Roman Catholic Church is decidedly not into leaving others alone in society by their various campaign, one wonders at the man's logic. But the rather fawning praise for the singer's talent tells us, phenomenologically, that the Church apparently feels that they now must make some sort of use of the gay artiste vibe. That is the real news. They have glommed on to every other fad in past  in an effort to make their rigidity current and more palatable, and jettisoned their own glorious traditions,  and apparently  now we will soon be treated to parish minstrels in holy drag, with tech songs about the Virgin Mary or Jesus. I have a suggestion where they might start to find performers, and it is with a little Papist, as he calls himself, at the rabidly right-wing Catholic Vote Action. With that connection the little circle of  reaction meeting with Bill Donahue's efforts will be complete.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"This album sucks!  I could blather on about how great Josh's voice is, how heartfelt and profound his compositions are, the angst of finding love and still could not come up with a decent enough excuse for this turd of a CD.  The Grobanites posting the orgasmic reviews of this CD are either doing so out of misguided love and loyalty for their curly haired cutie pie or they are simply deaf.\n\nI'm not one to expect any artist to sing the same old stuff album after album.  Josh definitely stretched his singing chops with the work he did with Lady Blacksmith Mambazo and the cool, hip, jazz piece \"Machine\" all from Closer.  Now that was cool.  It wasn't the same old Power Ballads that made him famous or the Foster Sugar Schlock.  But Illuminations makes it difficult to believe that Josh spent five years slaving over musical compositions and arrangements and the best he could come up with was this piece of crap.  What's even more ballsy is the price of the \"Internet Edition\" he's selling on his exclusive fan club.  $39.99 for this plus two additional digital downloads.  And why not?  The four to five star reviews posted just here proves that he can clear his throat and his devoted Grobanites will applaud him.\n\nWhat this album sounds like is that Josh goofed off for five years and told his fans he was slaving over the bestest-ever-in-the-world-CD-just-for-them and he knows they're stupid enough to believe him.  At the last minute, he moves to New York, putters about and then pukes up some whining, whinging, angst-ridden, lonely-in-New-York-looking-for-love pabulum that only Grobanites find palatable.\n\nGroban is better than this.","classification":1,"fold":9}

The Script has honestly been one of the biggest surprises that have came out the past few years. While many people have categorized them as one-hit wonders, I can honestly simply say that they have the drive not to be in that roll. Their latest single, For The First Time from their sophmore album, Science & Faith is definitely a good song. It really is better than all the cheap wannabe dance songs that've came out the past few years from acts like Ke$ha and Lady Gaga.

{"text":"This song is so blatantly self-explanatory, it screams controversial. Sure it has all the pop flavorings of a Justin Timberlake track, but lyrically, this song is anything but mainstream.\n\nLyrics: Nope, not reviewing those this time. You form your own opinion.\n\nMusic: Modern pop that is all the rage that you would hear on any top 40 radio station today. In fact, musically, it's sort of lazy and bland. Of course if you're a mainstream radio zombie, you'll love the music.\n\nOverall, this song hides nothing. Take it or leave it, or see it as the camp fest it is. I mean, the moon doesn't have this much cheese! This is certainly a one-hit wonder, in the vein of \"I Like Big Butts,\" and other camp classics.\n\nThe review title references a Family Guy episode title if you were wondering.\n\nUpdate: Holy freakin' crap! This abomination of a song just hit #1. Say what you want, but this is the true definition of selling your soul to the devil. Simply put, Katy Perry is just trying to ride a wave to become popular and rich, and she'll do anything to get to the top. Congratulations Katy, this is your penthouse. No substance, just pillow fluff. I've gotten over camp, this is just crap.\n\nConsider this: this song the 1,000 #1 of the rock era that began with \"Rock Around The Clock.\"  Congratulations America, look where we've come in rock & roll. Just one week ago, we had something original on our radios, now we have this mainstream garbage haunting our airwaves.

{"text":"I like this album.  I don't think it sounds quit as good as their first, but it is great for a second album.  There is still a lot of soul in this group, and the slight hip-hop feel is still in tact but here it is more subdued.  I feel that this group should be bigger than they are.  They are hard workers and it shows.  It is all about marketing these days...and these guys are very marketable, but for some reason the record company that backs them isn't really backing them as they should be, unlike similar sounding bands Moron5(typo on purpose) or OneRepublic who are shoved down our throats.  The Script is similar BUT BETTER than both of these bands don't get me wrong I do like OneRepublic but not as much as The Script... So if you like Moron5 (typo on purpose) or OneRepublic CHECK out The Script you may like them better.","classification":4,"fold":9}

Sadly, the quote of the name of the fame has drifted in the wind like her voice. Her music just hasn't worked for her like Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly. She just doesn't have that strike in the voice anymore in her songs. Her latest song G.U.Y., the third single from Artpop is trying to be more of a Madonna and Michael Jackson-esque sound, but sadly it doesn't have the interest at heart. Instead the song feels wasted and not worth the time. Maybe Lady Gaga should find herself a better G.U.Y. to be with her music than throw her voice away with.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":9}

Each had some great cuts, with Music's being the slightly better album of the two. \"Trampoline\" was even better, being consistent end-to-end; it reasonably merited 5-stars.\n\nThen, the group fell off the map with \"The Mavericks\" (2003), which qualified for an iffy 2 or 3 stars (and that was on the strength of \"In My Dreams\"). Raul Malo's solo efforts were worth getting, but nothing to rave about. So, I thought the Mavericks' string of great music had pretty much played out.\n\nWas I ever wrong! \"In Time\" is simply outstanding- probably the best album the group has ever done, with not one weak song... and several excellent ones.

{"text":"Robert Plant and Jimmy Page,late of Led Zeppelin,mellow out with some R&B\/swing numbers like the Top 10 hit SEA OF LOVE and the Top 20 hit ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT. Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers,who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic. Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN. It's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham. SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959. The differences between Phillips' recording and the cover are no \"buh-buh-buh-bum\" in the cover,a key change in the cover and Plant's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it. I guess that's because Plant is English(as is Page) and Phillips is American(as is Rodgers). ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT really swings. It got the lively 1940's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs. After this album,Plant,whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo. Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985. Recently,the surviving Led Zeppelin members re-formed with a new drummer and are currently on tour.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"Well, as we all agree, this is an amazing collection of great music at an unbelievable price. Aside from its remarkable contemporary interest--based on the low price made possible part by the brand-new distribution medium--this set is also of considerable historical interest, since it brings to a large audience the impressive back catalog of one of the most interesting and enterprising American record companies of the 1950s through 1970s, Vanguard Records, of which Bach Guild was a subsidiary label. Their Bach recordings, which were stylistically cutting edge at the time of recording, now offer an appealing middle-ground between the slow, reverentially old-fashioned Bach of the early days of recording and the super-sleek and hyper-fast Bach of contemporary historically-informed performances. Since there is so much music here, I thought I'd alert listeners to what for me are some of the highlights of this remarkable set. Perhaps others might want to add comments to highlight other fine performances I may have missed (I haven't listened to everything yet!) Part of my point in doing this--for the reviewers commenting here who may be new to Bach or even new to classical music in general--is that these aren't just competent performances at an exceptionally low price. These are excellent and historically important performances that any serious Bach collector would want to have, even at a much higher price. Give these performances a serious listen some time--as performances! Anyway, on to my set of highlights, in no particular order:\n\n1. The St. Matthew Passion conducted by Mogens Woldike. I learned this great music on a Vanguard LP of the Woldike set that I bought around 1970. It was at a budget price and seemed like a bargain then, but those four LPs cost far more than this entire MP3 download! I listened to that LP dozens of times and finally wore it out. I treasured the memory of this beautifully paced and sung performance, featuring an excellent team of soloists, and I thought I might never hear it again. But now here it is again for less the a buck, along with all this other music! Thank you, Bach Guild!\n\n2. The cantatas and excerpts featuring Maureen Forrester, the great Canadian contralto, which complete the set.\n\n3. The piano performances of James Friskin. I'd never hear of him, but his Bach is suave, beautifully phrased, and offers a clear and elegant rendering of the music's contrapuntal vocal lines. We get a lot of him: the complete Goldbergs, two French Suites, the Italian Concerto, and other shorter pieces. It's all quite good--an excellent listening experience even if you have multiple alternate performances of some of this music.\n\n4. Cantatas 80 (\"Ein Feste Berg\") and 11 conducted by Somary and featuring the ECO and an excellent group of English soloists: Helen Watts, Felicity Palmer and Robert Tear.\n\n5. Cantatas 51 and 209 featuring the memorable American soprano Theresa Stich-Randall.\n\n6. The flute sonata and partitas featuring Paula Robison, Timothy Eddy, and Kenneth Cooper.\n\n7. Cantata 140 (\"Wachet auf\") and 4 (\"Christ lag in Todesbanden\") which may seem a bit slow by contemporary standards, but which create a rich and moving polyphonic tapestry of sound that I think does great service to the musical and emotional content of these pieces.\n\nWell, that's a start, anyway, on the highlights of this set. If anyone has other favorites--or wants to amplify or cast doubt on the ones I've mentioned--please feel free to mention these in the comments.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Whether it's a rocker or a mid-tempo song Petty and the band know the way to your heart.\n\nAnother one of the (many) joys in listening to this set are the spontaneous audience participation bits.

The lackluster surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date, unannounced, feels more like she is trying to be too much like what Michael Jackson did, and the quality of his music died like the way he died in 2009. Partition, the latest song from Beyonce's self-titled record tries to deliver a raunchy sound, and sadly the heart of her voice has died, like she has lost in herself. I really and definitely found this song to be even worse than the songs she had done before that had delivered the same kind of sound, like Naughty Girl, Diva, and Baby Boy. If you are new to her music, I would definitely say no this song, and go to Naughty Girl from Dangerously In Love, because this song is absolutely a waste on a good talent.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":9}

I am not, repeat, not a legalistic Christian BUT the smattering of cuss words I heard on here was enough to give me pause and feel a touch of embarrassment.  Sho you are so talented and gifted man, you could have stated your wisdom without the coarse language.\n\nDo people curse\/ cuss in the real world? Of course. Can this album reach a Unbeliever due to the sheer volume of Mature themes and issues? Absolutely. But you diminished the Album's greatness with the hard language.\n\nThat said, here are the words that came to me as I listened:\n\nEclectic, Nouveau, PG, Thought-Provoking, Conversation, Real, Deep\/ Profound, Soulful, Truthful...\n\nIf you want to support Sho Baraka but are unsure what to download as Singles, (I copped the whole Album,) I suggest the following tracks:\nMahalia, Ali, Madoff, Peter Pan, Cliff and Claire, Me, King\n\nOf all the tracks only \"Michael\" \"Mrs.\" \"Denzel\" did I not feel. Not that they were bad, just not my style. They also had more than few cuss words in them to turn me off to the vibe he was going for.\n\nNow the \"big one,\"  Jim Crow.  This is no doubt the \"most controversial\" track on the whole album and with reason. It is a banger, a 5 banger, an Instant Classic, BUT the n-bomb, a garden tool, a female dog and primates are splattered all throughout.  This is a heavy song and will create much discussion.  It is NOT a bad song, just a heavy one.\n\nThis album is hardcore, and I get the feeling that Sho is still Christ-centered but he delivers the tales he spits with a venom that displays his own personal hurts and realizations.\n\nThis album is fire but for so much of the \"softer\" Christian Rap flare, it goes hard.\n\nSho may very well be the Tupac of Christian Rap...","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has been 7 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his life. Musically, he was one of the most influential entertainers of all time. But after the 80's and early 90's, Michael was losing his seat from the throne, and in 2009, he passed away. But he had some of the most brilliant songs during his peak of his success, and that will never be taken away from what he left behind. When the pressure was on to follow-up the mammoth success of Thriller, Bad didn't have the sales success in the long run, but Michael still had the chart success and some of the most timeless songs of his career, in fact more timeless than even Thriller, Off The Wall, or what he had with his brothers in the Jackson 5. Man In The Mirror remains one of Michael's most riveting ballad of the 80's, that still has as much serious heart reflecting on the negative world around us, and how differences can be made for a better life for everyone. It still is one of Michael Jackson's deepest ballads that is worth listening to each and every time. If you have never even heard a Michael Jackson song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"So you want a Beatles greatest hits album.  You see two old and one new compilations on the racks -- the much toted BEATLES 1 or the RED and BLUE ALBUMS respectively.  Reasoning it out, you see both are double discs whereas BEATLES 1 is only a single disc.  You want to know the sad part?  BEATLES 1 is longer than both individually.  Why?  Because they want to stick to the original format supposedly.  Yeah, whatever.  I think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting Beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rock'n'roll history (you mean there are actually people who don't know The Beatles' entire body of work by heart??  For shame!)  Both of them clock in about 70 minutes, whereas BEATLES 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes.  Either they need to do one of two things:\n1.  Expand the RED and BLUE albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection (the White Album is woefully underrepresented, whereas seven of Magical Mystery Tour's 11 songs are on there).\n2.  Add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively, getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can, and slap them onto a double disc set.  That way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs.  The only problem here that will undoubtedly crop up is the tendency to slaughter the cover art on Beatles records, and these make nice contrasting pictures, although the Red is from PLEASE PLEASE ME.\nAs far as the music goes, so much has been written about The Beatles what more is there to say.

{"text":"I had to spend a week with this album before passing judgement. I didn't want to be on the wrong side of history. This whole debate reminds me of those squares who piled on Dylan when he went electric at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. We all laugh at the footage of those dweebs crying on camera after Dylan's performance. \"He played an electric guitar!\" said those folk nerds between sniffles. This album has all the emotional depth of the previous albums. I like it better than Babel, but it is definitely not as amazing as Sigh No More -- that probably won't happen again. So, those of you who are pining for a repeat, it probably won't happen. But let's talk about this album. Are there songs that are total departures from their sound? No. Unlike many here I didn't hear Coldplay nor U2 and I am a huge fan of both of those bands. The thing that I keep thinking about is how this sounds like Mumford and Sons with an electric guitar plinking out the arpegios that the banjo used to plink out. The vocal harmonies are the same. Only Love has the old Mumford harmonies at the forefront of the song.\nSo, if Dylan never went electric imagine all the songs we would have been deprived of: Like a Rolling Stone, Rainy Day Women #12 & 35, Just Like a Woman, Jokerman. I like folk Dylan, but couldn't live without electro-Dylan.\nIf Mumford never went electric we'd deprived of my current favorite songs: The Wolf, Snake Eyes, Tompkins Square Park, and Believe. These songs have been on repeat and send chills down my spine more than anything on Babel.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Jewel continues to exist in that very small sector of recording artists who manage to musically better themselves with each new release.  Dispensing with the folk\/pop\/country undertones that often distinguish her music, but still lyrically on the same page, 0304 finds the singer beckoning us to the dancefloor.  Granted, this isn't the out-and-out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for--it's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward-thinking remixes of 'Serve The Ego' that she so effortlessly breezed through.  But, it is different enough from her previous work to seemingly brandish her a \"sell-out\"(other\nnew members of this club include indie-goddess turned power popster Liz Phair, but that's for another review).  Which is too bad, because this is indeed Jewel's best album--in fact, it's probably the best album Madonna DIDN'T make(and boy, she REALLY didn't make it with that folk-styled drink coaster otherwise known as AMERICAN LIFE).  First single 'Intuition' hints at things to come throughout the set, with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez.  'Stand', 'Fragile Heart' and the future club smash 'Run 2 U' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach.  And even if she falters somewhat by placing identical-sounding songs in slots ten through thirteen, it overall remains a more than solid musical treat.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This is a very catchy and inspirational tune on what it means to be self-reliant. I remember the song when it first came out because it was being promoted for the newer version of the Charlie's Angels Movie (Charlie's angels is even quoted in the song). I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50\/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as \"the shoes on my feet, I bought it\", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in). This is also a good song to listen to for putting oneself in a prosperous state of mind.  Overall, this is definitely a song to listen to if you like any of Beyonce's songs and\/or any music from Destiny's Child.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"There is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real, human and uncanny voice, and someone who markets themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is a product, not a real singer. Sadly, the feeling of her music has taken a turn downward with each and every record. When she had made a surprise release for her Beyonce' album, the move might have set sales on fire, but the album itself was a waste of money and time. Flawless, one of her songs from the Beyonce' album is honestly terrible. She doesn't actually ignite in her voice and it sounds more like a robot than a real songstress. I really did not find the song to actually deliver, instead I honestly feel that she brought in her hip hop style, and took it for a tailspin down. It really is one of her more pathetic songs on the album. Perhaps, the next time she comes out with music, than just be a product, she can honestly really feel what a real flawless singer is like. Too bad, there aren't many good ones anymore.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"Bodytalk\" by Robyn is a very exciting and catchy cd that has many high-energy songs that cover the various facets of relationships and having fun.  What is great about this cd is that Robyn carefully put musical tracks that covered various facets of what can happen in life. For example, Robyn sings about keeping her guard up, and only revealing herself to the one special \"nice\" person in the edgy ballad that is \"Indestructible\".  \"Time Machine\" appears to be about her coming to terms with her past and present in assisting her in becoming wiser. \"We Dance to The Beat\", \"Dancehall Queen,\" and \"Stars 4-Ever\" appear to be about having fun and making the most of life.  \"Get Myself Together\" is also a great song about striving to create more harmony, balance, and fullfillment in one's life. \"Stars 4-Ever\" really stood out for me, but all of her other songs on this compilation are very well-put together as well. Robyn creatively projects a strong and powerful spirit in many of her songs.  It is my humble opinion that Robyn's Bodytalk cd symbolizes the creative musical growth that she has achieved since her 1990's musical days of \"Do You Know (What it Takes),\" and \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect). Please understand that I do think positively of her two well known 90's songs, but this \"Bodytalk\" compilation showcases her talent even more.  Robyn's \"Bodytalk\" compilation is very much recommended if you enjoy high-energy dance\/pop music of a musician who projects much creativity and personal power.","classification":5,"fold":9}

The Beatles' songs interlaced with Thorne's instrumentals made for a great musical experience from the film.

All but 2 of her Top 10 country hits are here (no \"When I Get Through with You\" or the pasted together duet \"Have You Ever Been Lonely?\" with Jim Reeves.) In all, 7 of these are top 10 hits from the country charts.\n\nSoundwise, I'm sure it was fine at the time of release. However, since then, advances in CD technology have made it possible both to fit more songs on a disc (up to 80 minutes) and remastering improvements have made the sound quality you can achieve, even on \"vintage\" recordings, much better.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nFor these reasons, I'd argue that your best choice if you want only ONE disc of Patsy's music is THE DEFININITVE PATSY CLINE (ASIN B000002X0P).

That showed well with So What, and the ironic appeal of having her ex in the viudeo which was in good spirits. As for her latest single from Funhouse, Sober delivers a deeper and more dormid appeal that stands out in her feelings from her divorce. The song isn't bad, and brings in a mood that shows her feelings and depths of her voice fairly. while the song isn't bad, it isn't Pink's best song that shines, where as the case with her earlier songs like Stupid Girls and the deep Family Portrait showed. Honestly though, it is much better than what Britney Spears has delivered after her marriage died.

{"text":"Fronted by the otherworldly voice of Ben Bridwell, Band Of Horses make dreamy folk music ala Fleet Foxes and My Morning Jacket. Alternating between cushiony pop, unabashed folk and guitar rock, \"Cease To Begin\" cuts a wide swath musically. Sometimes the jumps can be jarring, like when the bashing guitars of \"Cigarettes Wedding Bands\" slips into the country ballad \"Window Blues,\" complete with a banjo. There's a great opener in \"Is There A Ghost\" that mixes both the dream-pop with an eventual cascade of guitsr, combing the band's strength in the best offering here. What ties this all together is Bridwell's voice and an uncanny sense of melody; even his brashest songs have underlying hooks. Add some really gorgeous harmonies (\"Window Blues\" again), you get one of those indie bands earning their cred the hard way, by working outside the system. \"Cease To Begin\" is a relaxed and understated album.","classification":4,"fold":9}

She was in somewhat of a dilemma considering her loss of a private life-a public life paired with a clothes horse reputation. It was a long shot to imagine musical crtics to come to her side.\nThis 1975 lp showcases her voice with Jimmy Webbs' lush orchestrations.\nThe best song here is the wailing \"Just this one time\",an under-rated gem,\nthat shows Cher at her most expressive. The last sentence in the song soars to a heighth never heard from the vocalist previously. \"Love Enough\" comes in 2nd with it's similar fully sung treatment.\nThe lp has several rockers,covers of the rock roster of the day-Clapton,Jackson Brown,Neil Young.\n.Cher is best on the unfamilliar songs.\nBut like all her 70's warner cuts this lp is lost to those without a record player. It's an interesting and curious effort from the pop icon of her generation. She is one shot away from a home run.\"Stars\" is a bit short on being completely an artistic statement.\nCher is a wiser singer today,and would probably sing this material even better 30 years later!

{"text":"The Beatles' \"Blue Album\" celebrates their talent by boasting nothing but just some of their infamous hits from the years 1967-1970. These songs come from several of the greatest rock albums of all time including Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (\"The White Album\"), Abbey Road and Let It Be. The Beatles' \"Blue Album\" both proves their genius and demonstrates their singular talent that no other band can replicate.\n\nThe two CD set allows us to realize that The Beatles wrote many different types of songs with different styles. This is also essential music that offers something for just about anyone who listens to the two CD set. The first CD starts off strong with the popular and psychedelic \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" other psychedelic and experimental songs include \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\" and \"I Am The Walrus.\" There are beautiful ballads celebrating love including \"All You Need Is Love\" and \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\" The Beatles also address the angst of a love that is no longer in the songs \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"The Long And Winding Road.\" Finally, the band sings songs that are just plain fun including \"Octopus's Garden\" and \"Back In The U.S.S.R.\"\n\nAnother reviewer makes an excellent point: If you want to understand the sharp differences in style between John Lennon and Paul McCartney at this time in their careers there is no better comparison than between \"Hey Jude,\" which is an classic ballad indeed, and \"Revolution,\" which is rather conceited, smug and bitter all at once.\n\nThe Beatles' use of the unconscious when writing trippy songs like \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"A Day In The Life\" enabled them to reach out to their fans and ultimately the world. The lyrics make sense even when they make no sense; this only adds to the beauty of the more psychedelic, trippy songs. Moreover, the songs on this two CD set work so well because they address universal themes of wanting to be loved, celebrating love and mourning a lost love.\n\nThe liner notes boast the lyrics to each song and great color photos of the band. The liner notes include the song credits, too.\n\nIndeed, The Beatles were so prolific in their writing and performing that this two CD set barely skims the surface of what they truly accomplished between the years 1967 and 1970. If you like this CD set I highly recommend you buy individual Beatles' albums to discover more about the band's creativity and boldness.\n\nOverall, this two CD set is more than just an introductory retrospective of The Beatles' music during the turbulent late 1960s. The \"Blue Album\" celebrates The Beatles' ability to communicate their political beliefs and amorous feelings for other people through their songs. These songs remind us to understand and appreciate the blessings of love, the evils of war and the importance of world peace--now.\n\nI highly recommend this CD for Beatles fans, fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how The Beatles taught us what was right through their music. This two CD set is a must have for any Beatles' collector as well as for anyone who wants to study the history of rock and roll.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"ABiCA who have been on the music underground for a few years now, even releasing 3 albums along the way, but it is with this release \"Numb\" that is now taking the band out of the underground scene and into the mainstream! \"Numb\" which is also considered the bands first official release is a blend of many styles from rap, hip hop, rock and even dance. If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is gonna hit you hard as it's a giant leap in quality.\n\nHash and Tac who are the two mcs\/vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style, it helps that they both have distinct voices and don't sound like each other. The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track \"Numb\" before the vocals kick in, it's a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note, in reality it's just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles. \"Tell Us Why\" comes bouncing out with heavy beats and industrial sounding guitars as Tac and Hash are joined by Binary Audio who were two thirds of the British band Radiator, Janne Jarvis joins on vocals and the song has a real Nine Inch Nails style to it. \"Turn Me On\" has a great interplay of vocals and keeps the album flowing into \"My Song\" which features former memeber Cant on vocals, the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy. The track features a cool loop throughout the track.\n\n\"The things You Think I Say\" features Approaching Nirvana on vocals and he gives the song a Linkin Park laid back sound. \"The Pursuit\" sounds like vintage \"Licensed To Ill\" Beastie Boys. \"Take This Away\" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background, it's a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well. On \"I Can Be Real\" ABiCA get real heavy, with some big drums and heavy guitars, the song is produced by Tweaker Ray who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself, his production qualities really shine on the track.\n\nABiCA even give us a big dance sounding track on \"Gave Em A Reason\" a track that features a big chorus. Former member Cant appears again on \"Blurry\". The final track \"What You See\" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties, it's a great way to finish off the album. The only complaint you can really level at the album is that at 16 songs it might be too long, especially for a debut and considering the short attention span climate we now live in.\n\nWith \"Numb\" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album, which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012. It's amazing to think the Tac and Hash have produced and released their own album, the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release, the artwork is cool with detailed information on who produced and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was. ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals. ABiCA are determined to get their name out there, and even on Hash's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people. ABiCA \"Numb\" deserves to be heard by a wide audience!!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"In a letter, Beethoven referred to Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) as my most beloved brother. His fond reference may have more to do with the fact that Hoffmeister published his 1st Symphony and his 2nd Piano concerto rather than any affectionate sentiment. Besides running his publishing house which is still in existence today as the London firm of Peters Edition Ltd., Hoffmeister also wrote a little music. At least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works have been credited to him. Counted in in that impressive output are at least 25 flute concertos, including the 3 here.\n\nProbably written some time before 1800 and published in 1803, the C Major Concerto is listed as No. 16. Trumpets and tympani give substance to the orchestral introduction of the opening Allegro, a sharp contrast to the long fluttering entrance of the flute. Characterized by a festive tone and a broad expansive sweep, this first movement features splendid work by the soloist, especially in the final cadenza, which incorporates elements of the opening theme. Written in C Minor, the dark Adagio drops the drums and brass to achieve a tragic air. Languid and sensuous, the central section brightens into the key of E Flat with some gorgeous tonality from the solo wind before a somber ending. With the full orchestra, the final Rondo is direct and straightforward, employing a bouncy irrepressibility that not even a brief excursion into A Minor can dim.\n\nDating from 1793 if not earlier, the concerto in G Major sports a leaner sound than the first work as the strings are accompanied only by horns and oboes. A sprawling Allegro opens, noteworthy for its juxtaposition of the wide ranging symphonic passages against the more nimble, intensely lyrical work of the flute. The concluding cadenza exhibits some outstanding work by the soloist, Bruno Meier, not surprising since he wrote it, as he did all the solo cadenzas on the this recording. Composed in G Minor, the elegiac Adagio seems to unfold as a funeral march. As the music shifts into B Flat, the grief disperses, but only fleetingly before the gloom descends for the final notes. A chirping flute initiates the closing Rondo Allegretto. Darting in and out of the more structured orchestral sections, the solo wind presents a wide array of virtuosic episodes in the carefree finale of the concerto recorded as No. 22.\n\nPenned in D Major, Concerto No. 17 was likely written before the other two offerings. Buttressed by oboes and horns, the quirky Allegro starts with a formal orchestral introduction, but soon deteriorates into a startling hesitancy. Restarting with renewed vigor, the surprising timidity returns and only dissipates when the flute finally enters, bringing a resolute assurance to this clever 1st movement. Over delicately plucked strings, a gentle flute carries the ensuing Romanza: poco Adagio, one of the high points of the disc. Elastic phrasing allows the soloist to explore the subtleties of this jewel, venturing into darker regions as the music shifts into a minor keyed interlude. Using a precise, clipped attack, the jaunty Rondo Allegretto concludes the recording. Offering a bravura display of technique and rhythmic dexterity, the sprightly episodes roll by, retaining a relentlessly sunny tone.\n\nOn his 14 carat gold flute, Bruno Meier is superb. Nearly as good, the Prague Chamber Orchestra supplies sensitive and thoughtful backing while the 2013 release by Naxos is excellent, placing the solo wind front and center without shortchanging the symphonic support. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, Hoffmeister fell into obscurity upon his death. He deserves better, and this second volume of his flute concertos, all world premieres, goes a long way to correct that oversight.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"What a treat, and especially for the bargain price. Usually collections like this are filled with marginal selections - B-side stuff - or familiar tunes performed by unfamiliar bands. This, however, is the real thing: a collection of some of swing's most recognized anthems performed by some of the iconic bands of the era.\n\nLike many bargain-priced collections, though, a few songs slip in that do not really fit. In the case of this collections a few tracks of jump blues, very early R&B and even proto rock managed to get included. Probably because those tracks swung and were from the era. I am not complaining because even those tracks are great. If you are wondering which, they are the ones by Louis Jordan, Roy Brown, Julia Lee & Her Boy Friends, and Ella Mae Morse. Click on their sample tracks above to hear what I am talking about.\n\nMy only complaint - it it's more of a wish than a complaint - is THE swing anthem, Sing, Sing, Sing, is missing. But then, had they included any rendition except Benny Goodman's January 16, 1938 Carnegie Hall concert I would have complained about that. The truth is with or without my favorite performance of a personal favorite song, this album is an absolute bargain and over five hours of swinging joy. I'd be a jerk to quibble. Especially given the selection of tracks and the great sound quality.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I've criticised Sonny's last couple of records for being a bit too lightweight and 'poppy', despite still having his state-of-the-art slide guitar playing. On this record he goes back to the blues, with versions of traditional blues such as Robert Johnson's \"Walkin' Blues\", Tampa Red's \"It Hurts Me Too\", Elmore James' \"Dust My Blues\", Skip James' \"Cherry Ball Blues\" and the old blues chestnut \"Key To The Highway\". All these songs are well-known and have been covered many many times but Sonny still manages to bring something new to them - with both his excellent guitar playing and also impassioned vocals - while playing them more-or-less straight and not trying to reimagine them or be too flashy. \"Firebird Blues\" is a nice, moody instrumental tribute to the late Johnny Winter and his guitar of choice.\n\nSonny's own songs which round out the record also reflect the slightly tougher blues sound of the classics, with the title track name-checking Muddy Waters and \"The High Side\" having a lighter, more acoustic sound. Although I liked the final track the instrumental \"Simcoe Street\", again I felt that all his own songs here seem just a bit too familiar, with sounds and melodies we've heard him play before. However, overall I thought that this was a good combination of some beautifully-played traditional blues and Sonny's own more melodic and thoughtful compositions, and (rather surprisingly) I'll choose the immaculately-played \"Dust My Blues\" as my favourite track.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"As a teenager i absolutely loved  Motown. I bought every Motown 45 that I could get my hands on sight unseen. There isn't a Motown artist who I don't like. However, of all of the Detroit stars there is one that was my favourite from the get-go. Come and Get These Memories was my introduction to Martha and the Vandellas (and make no mistake the Vandellas were an integral component of the sound). For about six years I waited with anticipation the next Martha release. I have listened to these songs so often that I know every word to every song.\n\nThis is a great collection. Every song is a killer. It is a five star collection. BUT, there are many excellent Martha songs not included. Where's Livewire, In My Lonely Room, Wild One? There are others equally deserving that have been omitted. So, as good as this compilation is, it is far from perfect. You don't need to be a completist in order to regret the omissions. If you are looking for a Martha collection go further - there are numerous other collections that contain more. Notwithstanding my reservations I cannot give any Martha CD anything but five stars.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Ever since The Band Perry appeared on the scene of what I would call 'New Country' I have liked them a lot. They are one of my favorite bands of the era after 2000. For the most part, they maintain a flavor of classic country stemming from a time before hard rock and heavy metal oriented musicians migrated into the country genre of music. I think this occurred sometime during the '90s when heavy metal of the late '70s and '80s style fell out of vogue and heavy metal turned into some semi-melodic boring and uninspiring noise, in my opinion. This song, released in 2013 on their album 'Pioneer' was a hit for TBP. It is a wonderful song, masterfully performed by Kimberley; the back-up vocals are very sweet and harmonious. I just love it. In fact, I like the whole album. I have purchased it on virtual CD. I am an audiophile. The MP3 format does not always fill the ticket for discerning ears and a high end audio system. The MP3 download sound quality of this song is better than what I had expected, though.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This gem fits right into the growing jewel-box of the jazz-and-folk-laced, original, female-POV R&B style spearheaded by the likes of Esperanza Spalding, Laura Mvula, Terri Lyne Carrington, and Corinne Bailey Rae.  The title track is driven by a punchy, 6\/4 rhythm that grabs the ears and won't let go.  Likewise, the Tarzan-like, chromatic harmonies of Forget make this one the clarion highlight.  Gone rivals Adeles Someone like You for reaching the soul of heartbreak.  But beyond the sophisticated musicianship, the lyrics go deep as well.  Age addresses the discriminatory glances afforded May-September romances.  Lost & Found is a tender reflection on post-romantic self-affirmation.  La Havas is strong, definitely an artist to watch, considering this is only her debut.  It certainly is big enough to love for a long while.","classification":5,"fold":9}

The songs here are more varied in style than Saved, and the Christian message is more subtle. It is more of a rock album with Christian lyrics, rather than a Christian rock album. This does not make it any better or worse than Saved or Shot of Love.\n\nFrom the medium grind of Gotta Serve Somebody to the reggae of Man Gave Names To All the Animals to the simple beauty of I Believe In You, Bob runs a gamut of styles and it all works. The back-up musicians mostly stay out of the way, which sometimes works for Bob and sometimes it doesn't. Here it does.

Yet sadly, they have tried to capture that essence without Steve. But it took a very long time before Journey would rejoin the group, and their Trial By Fire album would be the last bow Journey would make without Steve. When You Love A Woman, the lead single from that album is firmly and definitely still a great song that showed what Journey was still able to do in voice and song that measured with their 80's ballads like Open Arms and Separate Ways. The song definitely was underrated, yet still showed the absolute beauty that Journey still could've put forward with Steve, but decided not to and instead said goodbye to him. This is a great memory of what Journey had said goodbye to in love and song.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":9}

Before long Michael, Nathan, Wanya and Shawn would come to be known as Boyz II Men. And the rest as they say is rock and roll history. Throughout the 1990's Boyz II Men would amass an impressive total of ten Top Ten hits on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart. Remarkably, five of these tunes would make it all the way to number one!!  In July 1992 Motown released \"End of the Road\".  The song would spend an amazing 33 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the #1 song in the land for 13 weeks.  \"End of the Road\" would snag a Grammy as \"R&B Song of the Year\"  while Boyz II Men would be honored with a Grammy for \"Best R&B Vocal Group\" of 1992.

I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and\/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds.

{"text":"LUSH LIFE is a collection of 12 classic \"pop\" songs performed by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra.\nLUSH LIFE is one out of the three Ronstadt forays into the world of jazz standards and WWII-era pop numbers. Like its companions WHAT'S NEW and FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS, it captures the multi-faceted soprano buoyed by Nelson Riddle's big band stylings. Riddle, the former Frank Sinatra arranger, employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson, Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey. Ronstadt's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic. At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet, but Ronstadt sings such faves as \"When I Fall In Love,\" \"Skylark,\" \"Sophisticated Lady,\" \"Falling In Love Again,\" \"Lush Life\" and \"You Took Advantage Of Me\" with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle's overly ambitious arrangements.","classification":5,"fold":9}

I wish it was up to par with Phil Spector's \"A Christmas Gift For You\" or the multi-artist \"A Very Special Christmas\" because I've been searching for excuses in giving them more of a rest than I do. But it's not meant to be. Bob does irreparable harm to several of them. \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" and \"The Christmas Song\" are outright atrocities. However, sometimes he's in the zone. With that said, it must be admitted that he's feeling the joy on the jovial \"Must Be Santa\". Nothing is out of place and it's the established classic it deserves to be. His whispery delivery on \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" is exactly how the song should be rendered. \"Christmas Blues\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas are right down his alley. The background singers are good, even if they sing just a little too often. And the musically-inclined band that Bob chose is as great as he's had on his later works like \"Modern Times\" and \"Love and Theft\". Try it if you're a Dylan collector.

{"text":"This was Ambrosia's first big hit, from the summer of '75. It's a slowly building song that starts out like a club band slow dance number with very tight, polished harmonies, but goes far beyond what you would expect in its arrangement and production. Usually there would be a vocal departure after the first melody, a return and a finish. Instead, the song goes into a long instrumental bridge that gets increasingly bluesy and builds to a big climax of organ, synthesizer and wordless vocals that's really stunning, and then returns to the main melody of the song. With the instrumentation, the loud lead vocal and the halting rhythm, you are reminded at times of Pink Floyd, a band that one wouldn't ordinarily think of at the beginning of the piece. This is because the song was produced by Alan Parsons, who had produced The Dark Side of the Moon and who went on to his own group, the Alan Parsons Project.

{"text":"This is a great classic rock\/bluesey rock band with a piano thrown in for some southern-fried swagger.  Kind of a bluesy, gospel-ey sound with heavy guitars.  Their sound is hilighted by the strong, heavy, and  soulful George Ratzlaff vocals, man does this guy have some pipes!!\n\nIncludes mostly faithful covers of Red Rooster, You're No Good and a nice slowed-up cover of The Beatles Lady Madonna.  Mostly a bluesy, 70's rock vibe with good guitars.  A great listen for fans of Humble Pie, Stones or Faces.  The band had three albums so someone at the label obviously recognized some potential.\n\nAlso worthwhile from the 70's blues\/psych\/rock cannon, check out Head Over Heels, Black Cat Bones, White Chocolate, and the awesome smokin hot guitar album Totty!!!","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"'Houses of the Holy', from the legendary Physical Graffiti album. Don't you wish there was a song called 'Physical Graffiti' on the Houses of the Holy album? I never had Physical Graffiti on vinyl, thus I never had to flip the record. Having the CD means this song can surprise you if you aren't paying attention. 'In My Time of Dying' has a few moments of quiet talk before it completely finishes. Then, bam, the metallic 'Houses of the Holy' guitar jumps right out of your speakers, and if you're playing the album loudly, which of course you should be doing, the effect can be even more dramatic. It has happened to me many times, and I am always amazed. Surprisingly, Led Zeppelin never played this song in concert. Perhaps the opening riff would have shocked the audience. Or the monkey?\n\nJimmy Page with another incredible guitar riff, he sure had loads of them.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I don't even know where to start.\n\nIt's hard not to go into this album with ridiculously high expectations.  David Byrne and St. Vincent teaming up for a collaborative album?  Sounds too good to be true.  David Byrne, famous for his tenure in Talking Heads, has been on somewhat of a hotstreak recently with collaborations with Brian Eno (EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WILL HAPPEN TODAY) and David Sitek (\"Apartment Wrestling\").  St. Vincent (also known as Annie Clark) has established herself as a terrific singer\/songwriter on her own right after a string of wonderful solo albums.  The pairing of these musicians wouldn't seem likely, but they've come together to create LOVE THIS GIANT.\n\nFirst things first: this isn't a Talking Heads album.  It's not a St. Vincent album either.  It's not even somewhere in the middle.  In fact, it's probably best to just not expect anything at all.  The bulk of this album is carried by a funky and jazzy horn section.  Most of the guitar and bass instrumentation has been pushed aside for saxophones, trumpets, and trombones.\n\nThe album makes no attempt to hide what it is: the opening track \"Who\" begins with the prominent horn section before Byrne's vocals jump in.  The second track, \"Weekend in the Dust\" serves as a early highlight, with St. Vincent's vocals bouncing around just as much as the musical accompaniment.  \"Lazarus\" works as a duet between the two songwriters, beginning with a scholarly sounding introduction before the drums add a funky groove.  By the time the noodling guitar riff supports the verse, the most of the brass has disappeared. \"Lightning\" has a more laid-back and jazzy feel to it - St. Vincent leads this track, and it almost sounds like it would have fit in perfect with her recent album STRANGE MERCY.  The song has a jarring, disrupted chorus reminiscent of her \"Chloe in the Afternoon\" or \"Cheerleader.\"  The horn section erupts completely on the penultimate track \"One Who Broke Your Heart,\" where there are times when the brass gets so chaotic, it's hard to predict just what's coming next.  LOVE THIS GIANT ends with \"Outside of Space & Time,\" where the horn section finally takes backseat to the vocals; it's a welcomed rest for an album that is so frequently busy.\n\nAlthough I recognize it's not supposed to be a continuation of Byrne or St. Vincent's solo work, it's hard to not compare LOVE THIS GIANT to those high standards.  And honestly, it's a little hard not to feel a bit disappointed (and I think some fans will feel a bit angered as well).  I wouldn't consider this a wasted opportunity - there are plenty of high points here - but the sum of this pairing isn't that of its separate parts.  The advice that I do have for this release is this:  give it time.  LOVE THIS GIANT will definitely grow on you if you are open to it and you give are patient enough to explore some of its more busy moments.  Standout tracks for sampling\/download: \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lazarus\/dp\/B0094OLLG0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lazarus<\/a>,\" \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lightning\/dp\/B0094OLLVA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lightning<\/a>\" and \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Weekend-In-The-Dust\/dp\/B0094OLJRQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Weekend In The Dust<\/a>.\"  LOVE THIS GIANT is too good a record to be remembered \"that one album where the guy from Talking Heads and the St. Vincent lady played around with trumpets and trombones.\"","classification":4,"fold":9}

That is something today's divas have taken for granted in song. But there are some that haven't been given that credit, past being labeled as a one-hit wonder. Oleta Adams is one of those singers that had made that mark beautifully with one glimmer on the charts with her rendition of the Piano In The Dark Singer, Brenda Russell's song Get Here. The song is definitely one of those that shows strength and beauty with age like a fine wine after years of heart. I still love listening to this song each and every time this comes into heart. If you have never even heard a Oleta Adams song before, this is absolutely the one song to go to. So say you're going to get there to this beauty.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":9}
{"text":"Nirvana's Never Mind is considered the quintessential album of the grunge movement of the early 90's, since it proves to be the major influence aside of Pearl Jam's Ten and Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger- in the alternative rock scene. Indeed, most post-grunge bands (?) like Creed, Puddle of Mudd and Nickleback cite this album as an inspiration for their music. The album dealt with the youth rebellious attitude towards the American society and politics, personal life un-satisfaction, drug addiction, depression and suicide as the result of these factors. Incidentally, Kurt Cobain, the master mind behind Nirvana, was deeply affected by those abovementioned factors, as well as the personal demons he created when the band was at their highest popularity level. He was a genius with a troubled soul. Dave Grohl (currently the bandleader of Foo Fighters) shows his tremendous skills as a drummer, while Kurt Novoselic`s basslines are not short of brilliance As for the album, it includes four of their renowned classics such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are and Lithium plus other powerful tracks such as Territorial Pissings. Overall, this is a classic disc not to be missed out.","classification":5,"fold":9}
{"text":"'Everything is everything.' I love the friendly chatter that opens this sweet tune. What's Going On was co-written by Renaldo 'Obie' Benson, a member of the Four Tops, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland, and Marvin Gaye. Benson had witnessed police brutality in Berkeley and was really shook up by it. He began to ask himself all sorts of questions, like why were kids being sent off to Vietnam? and why were kids being beaten at home? Marvin Gaye was asking himself, with all the problems going on in my country, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs? The song is a plea for people to talk with each other and explore alternatives to war and violence. 'For only love can conquer hate.' It's amazing to me that this song is still relevant all these years later. Will our world ever evolve to the kind of existence that everyone can enjoy?\n\nMusically, I've always loved the drums. Marvin Gaye played a box drum accompaniment to the regular drums, producing this oversized ping pong ball quality. The saxophone opening is a classic. The legendary James Jamerson played the bass while laying on the floor. Excellent string arrangement.","classification":5,"fold":9}

I like the song, because it is definitely better than most of the trashy and lackluster songs on radio right now. I hope the song continues to deliver for Adele, and she may want to use it for her next album.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"This was quite a surprise, as after the past few Megadeth albums, I was seriously considering not giving this album a chance. I was interested in the new lineup - Chris Broderick is an amazing guitarist, but it was clear he wasn't happy in Megadeth and was not able to contribute much to the writing. So here comes Kiko Loureira and Chris Adler to inject some new life into things, and I must say things have certainly turned around. This is probably a top 5-6 album for Megadeth, the five star bar being set by Rust In Peace and Countdown to Extinction. The \"Megadeth sound\" is still there production-wise and the musicianship is outstanding - Kiko can really shred with the best of them. It's strange that listening to this, I don't really pay attention to the drums - they are fine, but your attention is not drawn to them. Chris Adler reserves his really good stuff for Lamb of God, I guess. The songs are very strong, at least the first half of the album. \"Fatal Illusion\" is a great song - odd, off kilter intro that leads into a killer bass line by Ellefson, and then some good ole thrash - this song is most reminiscent of the Rust in Peace era. \"Death from Within\" and \"Bullet to the Brain\" are also great, more modern sounding Megadeth songs, both with catchy verses and choruses. Things drop off after that. \"Post American World\" is a \"Symphony of Destruction\" rip off, but with a lackluster chorus, and silly, preachy lyrics. \"Poisonous Shadows\" and \"Lying in State\" are sorta boring - not memorable. The instrumental \"Conquer or Die\", is a nice extended solo essentially - great chops, but not anything to rave about as far as a song. \"The Emperor\" is a punky, tongue in cheek uptempo song that reminds me of something off of Cryptic Writings. I like it more and more on repeated listens - growing on me. The last song, a cover of \"Foreign Policy\", is not necessary - seems out of place. All in all, I think most Megadeth fans will find something to enjoy on Dystopia -cool riffs, interesting solos, typical Dave lyrics, tight thrash grooves, etc. A solid 4 star album.","classification":4,"fold":9}

This is terrific not just for the holiday season but all year round! The guitar, flute and more all combine to make this a truly fine version of \"Greensleeves\" and there's a part of it that has an imaginative, jazzy flavor to it that sticks in my mind and makes me want to listen to it again.\n\nI recommend this music by Tony Elman.

Embracing the essence of the sweetest side of mid to uptempo funky soul the album was one of his best works from my end. Interesting place the R&B community these days isn't it? If you took it literally most of it isn't rhythm & blues at all. Mostly some type of hip-hop\/soul hybrid of one sort or the other in a lot of ways. Only in the past few years has their began to be a change in that. Benet was well poised to be at the forefront of this. After all he was a somewhat unsung pioneer of the whole neo soul movement to begin with. But while the outlook of that music was noble,it didn't always have that important spark soul music of any sort required to give it that passion and feeling. In recent years Benet has again been on the forefront of a music that I am not sure has a formal name yet. It's of a retro soul\/funk flavor. But it has contemporary production values. And on this particular album Benet also brings something back into his chosen genre that has been almost totally absent for quite a long time.\n\n  There's a definite variety in unity in this album. That's what I'll chose to call it. It's based in soul but gets under the layers a lot. \"Harriet Jones\" and \"Redbone Girl\"t,that one with Lil Wayne are great examples. Both of them are full of churning funkiness. But also don't shy away from that bluesy gospel flavor and are actually very honest and earnest R&B in the very real sense of the word. Both songs also allow the male and female characters to be honest with dignity. \"Waitin\",\"Real Love\" and \"Runnin\" are three of the best ballads Benet has ever done. They are sweetly funky in that Al Green\/Thom Bell hybrid sort of way and minimally produced in the best hip-hop oriented production style. Though they are not at all hip-hop songs. \"Hope It's You\" is a take no prisoners reggae number featuring Shaggy. It's the first time I ever heard Benet do this type of song. \"News To You\" has that wonderful EWF\/Charles Stepney approach to the music and is one of my favorite ballads here. \"Come Together\" has a swinging jazzy soul flavor to it,along with it's pleas for romantic togetherness is another favorite here in the ballad department.\n\n  In terms of uptempo tracks my favorite here is \"Muzik\",a wonderfully melodic sophistifunk number accented with light electronics almost close to perfection. \"Gonna Be My Girl\" and \"Lay It Down\" are the closest things here to modern day retro 80's hip-hop\/dance ballad type production but do this very tastefully and are strong melodically. \"Here In My Arms\" is a gentle piano based lullaby to his daughter Lucia that brings to mind what Billy Joel did for his daughter Alexa. There's also a hidden track here that really got to me called \"Come Home To Me\". It's something I haven't heard in awhile-a blend of country soul with some light twangy guitar and some gospel\/soul arrangements. With such a good range of music that still sounds totally unified,this album also showcases Benet's romantic maturity. Here he is a stable married man with a family. He's aware of his past,as well as the assets and flaws of him and his significant other. The lyrics encourage a good deal of adult style honesty. And the music reflects that. This could be a candidate for Eric Benet's finest album in his career thus far. It has all the key ingredients that created such classics for Otis Redding,Al Green,Isaac Hayes,Marvin Gaye and Teddy Pendergrass during the album oriented soul era. And it does so with a lot of care and inspiration.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Comedy CDs are an iffy recommendation.  What's funny today might bore you tomorrow.  Some jokes are only funny the first time.  Jim Gaffigan's CD, \"Doin' My Time,\" scores high on the replay factor.  Perhaps it's his delivery (dry self-deprecation with a twist of smug).  Perhaps it's his avant-garde style of humor (he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show, weaving \"her\" comments with his).  Perhaps it's just his voice, which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self-mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic.\n\nPart of it is definitely the humor itself.  Whether his jokes make bizarre 180's (\"I used to smoke.  Yeah.  Smoking's real addictive.  But you know what's REALLY addictive?  Heroin.\"), or whether their humor lies in their dead ends; whether they take the \"didja ever notice?\" concept and snap it in half (his \"Hot Pocket\" and bottled water\/Mexican food bits are a good example of this), or whether they're just plain crude, grouchy, silly and dumpy, they all stand up to repeated listenings.  There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man (and, in fact, most of them are like that; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to), but none of them fail to be laugh-worthy because of it.  Pasty, flabby, and grumpy, though he may be, Jim Gaffigan is also a funny, funny man, and this is a funny, funny CD.\n\n(NOTE: This product comes with a short DVD of his Comedy Central appearance, which is much cleaner than the act to be found on the CD.)","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"Oh yeah, if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear, this is the one! I have heralded only one track\/song by the Queens as the ultimate new age piece destined to become the fashion of the new generation in 2013 and beyond (actually it came out on the airwaves years earlier) and it is one of the two and only two (so far) pieces they were able to write and play that I really love and enjoy hearing it over and over again so much that I would buy the album. The superior details of my pick as the new age tune of the coming age are;\nfirst the subject which carries a universal message that everything they tell you or feed to you isn't true. There is a mystical truth that no one knows but you can know if you want to. Simple, right? Nothing earth shattering about that, but I find such deeper nuances and openings to a deeper or higher truth in it every time I hear it.\n  Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying \"avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee...\" but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"I love, love this song and janelle is doing her thing on this song \"thighrope\". This song put her on the map because it was her first break out hit. The song is about keeping a good attitude in the midst of all one's haters. Sometimes when people see you doing good, they be wishing that you fail and talk badly about you. The only thing you can do is to ignore them and keep pushing ahead. Monae stands out because she is different,nobody sounds like her nor look like her.  I definitely recommend this song to anybody who wants to listen to some great music.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"\"The Suburbs\" is Arcade Fire's much acclaimed third album. It's a relatively long album, which plays for about one hour; so it may take some time to get a good overview of the music.\nIf you got the grip of the very exciting debut album \"Funeral\", you should be likely to enjoy more music in the same genre. It can be difficult to describe the music in few words, but groups like Velvet Underground and Talking Heads must be among the inspiration sources. The sound may seem a bit scratched at times, but the numbers are quite varied, ranging from the very melodic to the noisy and punked.\n\nAn important prerequisite for being able to keep Arcade Four right, I think, is that you appreciate the two singers of the group, of whom Win Butler obviously is the most important one. The female voice, R&eacute;gine Chassagne, may appear a little flimsy, but she also possesses a speciality that some will enjoy and others dislike. Personally, I'm a fan of both of them, especially when they deal with melodic songs with the group; On this album one could highlight \"Half Light\", \"Suburban War\", \"Deep Blue\", \"We Used to Wait\" and \"Sprawl II\".\nIn general, you might say that Arcade Fire is a group that sets certain demands for its listeners; Not much easy listening here.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":9}

There isn't anything on it anywhere nearly as memorable as to be found on \"Once\".\nI will say that it's not completely unlistenable. It could sound ok as background, ambient music in a coffeehouse, but it's nothing that grabs your attention and has you coming back for more.\nI don't know what went wrong with this album, but it surprises me greatly to call it what it mostly is: dull.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"Whenever discussion about Weird Al Yankovic crops up, inevitably conversation will turn to \"the Coolio incident.\"  Evidently Weird Al got permission to make his parody from the record label responsible for releasing the rapper's song \"Gangster's Paradise,\" but not from the artist himself, and Coolio was upset enough at the final product to demand it be pulled from the album.  The incident has been overblown by the press -- and Weird Al and Coolio even made up and settled their differences somewhere along the line -- but in the end it probably turned out to be good for Al's career.  After all, how many people would have paid much attention to Al's parody had it not been for Coolio kicking up a fuss?\n\nI dislike rap in general and am ambivalent toward \"Gangster's Paradise\" specifically... but Al's parody is a hilarious sendup, poking some not-too-harsh fun at the Amish and having some fun with the original song without mutilating it beyond recognition.\n\nOne of Al's greatest strengths has been creating parodies that still hew close to the original song, often to the point of having musicians from the original group perform their parts.  \"Amish Paradise\" is very stylistically close to \"Gangster's Paradise,\" to the point where, the few times I have heard the original, I've mistaken it for Al's version up until he started singing.  The humor comes from occasionally tweaking elements of the original song or music video for humorous effect, and from they lyrics themselves.  Plus, it's just funny to hear the song being sung with utmost seriousness, but with such absurd and ridiculous lyrics.\n\nSaid lyrics do poke fun at the lifestyle of the Amish, but they're never mean-spirited.  It's probably very unlikely that the Amish will ever hear the song for themselves, but I doubt they'd find much in the song offensive.  It does call the Amish's lifestyle boring, but let's face it, our technology-addicted culture probably WOULD find the Amish way of life boring and primitive.  It's all for comedic effect, and not to bash or demonize anyone's lifestyle.\n\nEven as someone who isn't a fan of rap, I place \"Amish Paradise\" among my favorite of Weird Al's songs.  It's fun, catchy, and a good homage to the original without being disrespectful.","classification":5,"fold":9}

It isn't a unique style of song, nor is it a great classic. Plain and simple, it is a tight pop song, well done, that makes you feel good regardless of what you are facing in life. It is one of those songs that kind of brings a smile to your spirits if not your face. It's a great tune to have for any 1970s  retro party. Don't put any thought into it.

I was surprised upon learning last year in September that there will be an upcoming release for \"Fly Me To The Moon...The Great American Songbook, Volume V.\" I immediately pre-ordered it and it was delivered on 18th of October 2010, one day before its scheduled release. (Thanks AMZN for timely delivery. You are simply the best web site on Planet Earth! As a customer\/reviewer on my 9th year now, I never had any single problem with delivery and service in general).\n\nIs Volume V better than the previous series? Is it the best from all the five? Or is the best still to come? After listening to the two-CD set DeLuxe Edition, I then re-listened to the first, second, third, fourth volumes and compared notes. This latest offering has charms of its own. Firstly, the selected material is outstanding. There's never a weak link in the sequence of tracks. Secondly, Rod Stewart shines the most in his interpretations of \"September In The Rain\" (loved that terrific vibes solo by Alex Navarro), \"What A Difference A Day Makes,\" \"My Foolish Heart,\" \"When I Fall In Love,\" \"Beyond The Sea\" and the title track, \"Fly Me To The Moon.\"\n\nAnd thirdly, if you like to listen to an innovately fresh and upbeat rendition of \"Love Me Or Leave Me,\" with the opening verse, this is the latest version to consider. Joe Sample, a fine jazz pianist, joins Rod the Fab and lends his expertise in piano playing. The background vocals are so delightful and add verve to the rendition.\n\nLastly, Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" is also a highlight. Its pretty arrangement is one of the most impressive charts ever written. It's so wonderful to hear the combined sounds of guitar, violins, mandolin.\n\nWhat else is there to say? I am a sucker for The Great American Songbook so I'm definitely not leaving it...I'm loving it! Thanks Rod the Fab!","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"The career of singer\/songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP, \"West.\"\n\nA moody collection of life, love and Americana, the record testifies to her ever-evolving talent and drive for musical perfection.\n\nWilliams is a tough chick -- the kind you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again.\n\n\"Are You Alright?,\" the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, \"Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?\" and \"Is there anything I can do?,\" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.\n\nThis upfront quality permeates the collection. \"Everything Has Changed,\" for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic \"What If\" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.\n\n\"Where Is My Love?\" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation, appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song \"Learning How to Live.\" A particular standout, the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup:\n\n\"'All I have left is this dime store ring\/But I wouldn't trade it for anything\/The days ahead will never be the same\/For you I might have even changed my name\/I'm learning how to live.\"\n\nThe melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother, whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated \"Mama You Sweet.\" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track, \"Fancy Funeral.\":\n\n\"So don't buy a fancy funeral\/It's not worth it in the end\/Goodbyes can still be beautiful\/With all the money that you'll spend\/There's no amount of riches\/Can bring back what you lost.\"\n\nHer search for love continues on the haunting, lyrically intense \"Unsuffer Me.\"\n\nAlternately, \"Rescue\" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.\n\nDifferent melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. \"Wrap My Head Around That\" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat \"Come On\" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.\n\n\"Words\" attests to the life-affirming power of language, whether uttered or harbored within, providing the most seductive melody of the disc, while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet:\n\n\"I sleep out in the desert\/Under the stars above\/And keep making an effort\/To wander into love\/Who knows what the future holds\/Or where the cards may fall\/But if you don't come out west and see\/You'll never know at all.\"\n\nWilliams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album \"Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,\" but \"West\" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature.\n\nWith her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate, personal level, it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career, her fanbase only continues to expand.\n\niTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of \"West,\" offering various bonus demos of the album's selections.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"So ... when did you come of age with Iggy Pop?  Did your ears first meet Iggy in 1969 as I did, was it 1973, or was it in 1977, when a song about a passenger sent your fingers rushing to dial the radio station to see who was singing.\n\nIve lived nearly my whole life with Iggy, Ive lived nearly my whole life attempting to like his music, his theater, his character, and his vision.  Yet after all this time I still find Iggy Pop to be nothing more than a novelty, with a mere handful of songs that I enjoy.  So why in the world would I think that Post Pop Depression, especially claiming it as his swan song, complete with Queens of the Stone Age in tow, would be any more, or any different.\n\nPeople would like to tell you that theres something raw and hedonistic about Iggy Pop, and for mere moments thats true ... but those moments come on fast and and are just as fleeting.  Here we are, stepping into the 21st century, and Iggy Pop is attempting to doing the same old shtick he did in the latter half of the 20th century, and doing it not nearly as well.  Post Pop Depression is not something I even care about, much less hold dear to my heart, praising the powers that be, thrilled and saddened in the same moment that Im holding a new Iggy Pop album in my hands, and knowing it will be the last.\n\nMost music rags are afraid to tell you they don't like the album for whatever reason ... but Im not.  MOJO gave it page after page and talked only about the secret nature of the release and Iggys Rolls Royce.  Rolling Stone talked endlessly about the old Iggy and his emergence with the Stooges.  Iggy tells us that he likes the songs, and so do some of his friends; though he says it in a less than convincing manner.  Make no mistake about it, Post Pop Depression is not bad because its the music of an old man, its also not bad because of its association with Queens of the Stone Age ... its just bad because its a grouping of songs presented in a manner thats irrelevant.  If Iggy had one thing going for him, it was that he was a one trick pony and you always knew what you were gonna get.  But this, this is Iggy trying to be relevant, and failing utterly.  He might have well recorded with Primal Scream, they couldn't have helped him make it any worse.\n\nThe album has a feel of desperation laced with incomplete thoughts, structured to guide the listener nowhere.  This is not punk, this is not 21st century punk, this is frustrating musical purgatory that will not last for more than one or two playings ... truly post Pop depression.  Here we find Iggy Pop making the rounds with Josh Homme, each hoping to gain some credibility from the other, just as Iggy so transparently did with Lou Reed, David Bowie, and a host of others.  Theres no search and destroy here, theres also no psych punk Queens of the Stone Age ear splitting anthems, its all slightly affected nervous energy, injected with a spirit that belays the end of a roller coaster ride ... no hills, no downward plunges or sharp curves, just the jittery end of the ride stop and dis-embarkment.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":1,"fold":9}

{"text":"It's well known that Danny Elfman didn't finish working on the Wolfman OST because he had to focus on this one, and after hearing it I'd say he made a good choice.  While Wolfman disappointed in several areas, Alice in Wonderland more than makes up for it.\n\nElfman's 8-note motif for Alice is used much like Wagner's works in the Ring Cycle, but not so often that you'll get bored with it. I was surprised at the appearance of the children's choir- which is very reminiscent of the Xbox Fable soundtrack he worked on- but he incorporates it brilliantly, if a little too much.  Elfman composed lyrics for the main theme and also uses them in the reprises as harmonies, which helps to maintain the atmosphere of a woman-child lost in a magical and dangerous place (The oft-repeated leitmotif 'Oh, how will you find your way?' also suggests a sub-plot of finding oneself emotionally).  A stirring chorus makes several appearances in the reprises as both the choir and the orchestra blend into the four-noter \"Alice... Alice... Ohhh, Alice!\" to great effect. It's playful yet maintains the sense of forboding.\n\nA few key tracks:\nAlice's Theme: Typical Elfman strings start underneath and build quickly; the use of the children's choir, evocative lyrics and slightly off-kilter tempo actually made me want to see this movie- or at least the opening credits.  Also the longest track at just over five minutes.\n\nProposal\/Down The Hole: Horns take you to a nice quiet day out in the English country.  Then the rabbit appears in a brief reprise of the Alice motif... and down we go.\n\nDrink Me: Strings and chimes convey the need to decide on something, and soon.\n\nAlice Reprise 2: My favorite of these; nicely done and a little mysterious!\n\nCheshire Cat: Sorry to say there wasn't much there; the nice eerie start doesn't quite engage you, leaving pretty much just a cat sitting a tree.  Good use of the chorus at the end.\n\nAlice & Bayard's Journey: The most action-oriented track.  Fun & frenetic, yet it seems more like battle music than a harried trek through Wonderland.\n\nAlice Reprise 5:  Final track starts off minimally with strings and voices and rises into an extended motif invoking the main theme and includes partial lyrics.\n\nThis is definitely not your grandmother's AiW; while wondrous and magical, its denizens are also darkly dangerous and just this side of macabre- and fully realized in the musical cues like you'd expect from a Burton\/Elfman collaboration.  The entire album streams continuously as tracks often lead into one another seamlessly, maintaining the flow. My only real sticking point is the glaring lack of individual themes for the Red Queen, Tweedledum & Tweedledee and yes, the Mad Hatter!  Other than that, this one's a lot of fun. It's a true Elfman opus, and I defy you not to start nodding your head to this one!  A standout addition for your collection.","classification":4,"fold":9}

{"text":"i love REK and own just about every album he's ever made.  this crossover bluegrass album, however, doesn't succeed.  the music landscape is littered with the bodies of fine country and alt-country artists who have tried to cross over to bluegrass and failed (e.g. dierks bentley) or stumbled across the finish line (e.g. merle haggard), but very few (patty loveless) have actually succeeded.\n\nbluegrass is a different animal and, for one thing, REK's quirky, tremulous voice isn't well-suited for it.  The other issue here is that REK just doesn't seem to be feeling the music and his performance is uninspired.  Ironically, some of the songs on this album aren't even bluegrass, they are folk, blues or something else, but not bluegrass.  His band is good enough - especially dennis ludiker of the progressive bluegrass band MilkDrive - but the apathy of REK seems to have infected his band.  Even guest vocalists such as Peter Rowan and Lyle Lovett can't rescue him here.\n\nThose unfamiliar with bluegrass music and who, therefore, have no expectations, may well enjoy this album and (as previous reviews indicate), most seem to.  However, I believe those familiar with bluegrass will likely be disappointed.","classification":2,"fold":9}

{"text":"I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonnie Pointer to be released on CD. It is such a highly unique album. The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic \" MY EVERYTHING \" with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of \" AH SHOOT \", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly true! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, \" AH SHOOT \" is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear \" AH SHOOT \" the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn't the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I'd give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star. Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before you make it on CD.","classification":2,"fold":9}

You begin driving with one hand, the other is now a microphone or a very vivid gesturer of your feelings.  Your voice begins without you realizing, singing along with all of the memories of past best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, and imaginary friends swimming in front of your eyes.  Then you realize that you are crying as you sing at the loudest your emotion allows. Two hands on the wheel now, clinging while you say whoa-oa-oa. Then your hand returns, holding up a hush finger to your memory, \"Don't speak!\" you wail.  The words all come to you and for about five minutes you are overcome.  Wherever you are, red light, freeway, parking lot, side streets, or waiting for the song to end before you leave your car because you are at your destination, you sing.\nThis song deserves more than just that karaoke rendition in your car. It deserves to be heard more.  It deserves to be owned.\nBuy this song.  Sing this song.","classification":5,"fold":9}

Remember Who You Are is where they should be. I think this album is their best since Untouchables. Working with Ross Robinson was the best choice, and right choice, Korn could have made. Remember Who You Are, goes back to the sound of Korn's early days. I never thought Korn could come back to this, I am proud. I don't think if they didn't work with Ross, the album wouldn't of turned out this way. Korn is back almost better than before. I've been a fan of Korn for a long time now. I wasn't happy it took three years, for them to release another album. I wish Brian Head Welch could be back in the band, maybe someday. I know things happen. I think Korn is on top of their game, and I hope they don't stop now.\nThis is one of my favorite top 5 albums of the year. My favorite songs on Remember Who You Are:\n1. Move On\n2. Are You Ready to Live?\n3. The Past\n4. Fear is A Place to Live\n5. Pop A Pill\n6. Never Around\n7. Let The Guilt Go","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"This is a Jazz album that everyone should have in their collection. The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together.\n\nRecorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.\n\nOf course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.\n\nSadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing. This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase.","classification":5,"fold":9}

{"text":"What better way to get into the holiday spirits than with a piece of poo? Mr. Hankey and friends deliver 45 minutes worth of foul-mouthed & high spirited Christmas tunes. Some are originals and some are just completely butchered reworkings. If you've seen the South Park episode of the same name, you are familiar with only half the content of this CD. The rest of it is just as much of a treasure. Sure, everyone's heard \"Christmas Time In Hell\" and \"Merry F'ing Christmas,\" but the best songs are the ones that slip under the radar. \"The Most Offensive Song Ever\", a duet between Mr. Hankey and Kenny proves to be just that, focusing on Virgin Mary. Cartman's \"Swiss Colony Beeflog\" comes as a favorite to me. Little Eric reaches Bruce Springsteen type singing when yearning for that one thing that truly makes Christmas special. \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\" is done very hilariously and sloppily by the South Park Children's Choir and Stan's sister Shelly lisps her way through \"I Shaw Shree Ships\" ... I mean \"I Saw Three Ships.\" Heck, the album cover alone is incentive enough for you to purchase this CD. Since the time I've had it, I have enjoyed Christmas 100% more.

{"text":"One of the main things that defines this album is the same one that Mint Condition have always contended with-that they are a full fledged band devoted to creating  contempory R&B music as a self contained band of songwriters,producers and live instrumentalists. And I say the same thing of this album as I did of the previous album I reviewed:why is that necessarily so important? As if modern R&B is something to aspire to. Read any reviews on classic music here from all ages and you'll hear more reviews of classic recordings based mainly in comparing them with \"the horrible music today\" and these reviews are painful to read. That's because there is much great new R&B of all sorts being made in the modern style but there's also a lot more unintentive generic material in the same style as well. And even if they're now signed to a small indie label Mint Condition are again faced with that same situation since the condition of commercial R&B has worsened significantly over the years.\n\n  Now that's not to say that the first two numbers on here are not amazing. Staying true to their roots in the Minneapolis sound \"Can't Get Away\" and \"I Want It\" both have the same kind of skipping drum machine breaks,rhythm guitar riffs,synthesizer accents and major to minor chord accents to make them both highly innovative modern R&B as well as being based in a wonderful (and also innovative) funk style....that another guy from Minneapolis once pioneered in bygone days. Now if the album had kept moving from that point on this would've been one of their better albums. But if that's what one's looking for,depending on your point of view this album may not be your cup of tea. That's because the rest of consists of either generic modern and very pro toolsy digitized modern dance\/R&B such as \"East The Pain\" or more generic ballads such as \"Not My Daddy\" featuring singer Kelly Price. The do it all very well but it doesn't show them moving on the way the self reflective and very abstractly jazzy closer \"Twenty Years Later\" which does indeed show the band moving the contempory R&B genre forward significantly.\n\n  Mint Condition are a band I've always wanted to like. I heard their songs for awhile now but never owned any of their albums. The reason being,for one is that I sensed,as I did with bands such as Toni Toni Tone before them that they would always have the struggle as a live oriented band of having to deal with the very hip-hop producer centered R&B community and would have a hard time maintaining any kind of stable musical integrity as a result. Again on this album they've kept any possible creative and artistic touches to a minimum and that's a tendency I really would like to see them remedy in the future. It would seem that anyone these days trying to be contempory and creative in the R&B genre are going to run into a good deal of difficulty and considering what this album offers up I am not certain how things will change if they do for a long time.","classification":3,"fold":9}

{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I really like Tracy Chapman - BUT I expected better considering it is 5 years between albums.  'Telling Stories' begins with the title track which has received reasonable airplay in Australia for  awhile now.  The song eventually grew on me as it is rather catchy, so I  went and bought the album.  I have listened to the album more than 5 times,  and it is rather dull.  It is lacking some magic and life, and fails to  really deliver.  After each track, you wait for the next one to be a little  different but they all sound very similar.  As mentioned by other readers,  the album is very short in that finishes well under 45 minutes.  I believe  consumers are entitled to a few bonus tracks these days. My favourite  tracks include 'The Wedding Song' and 'Unsung Psalm'. The album is probably  an ideal purchase if you want background music for a dinner party, but for  those who are after some Chapman music - go for the first album.","classification":3,"fold":9}
