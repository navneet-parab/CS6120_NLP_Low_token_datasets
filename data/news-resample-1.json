The media, once again, focused only on the most sensationalized elements -- in this case, a CVS being looted, footage of which looped endlessly -- ignoring both the long historical context for the anger and the substance of the more representative non-violent protests. But those protesters' calls for justice were, in fact, being heard. On Friday, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby charged the six officers involved in Gray's arrest with a range of crimes including murder and manslaughter. \"I've heard your call for 'no justice, no peace,'\" she said in announcing the charges. Whatever happens in this particular case, it's clear the problems with our justice system go beyond Baltimore. A start on fixing them would be putting as bright a spotlight on the underlying issues as we do on a looted drug store.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":1}

The resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.\n\nThe aim of The WorldPost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.\n\nTo achieve this aim, The WorldPost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. Along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. Every week, they weigh in as events break from Havana to Beijing, from Moscow to Mexico City, Paris, New Delhi and Abuja among so many other places.\n\nThe WorldPost seems to have met an outstanding need.

{"index":50365,"text":"A furious war of words was unleashed at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore last weekend. The U.S. and Japan accused China of trying to change the status quo by coercion and intimidation; the Chinese accused Japan and the U.S. of inciting instability with its \"20th century mentality\" of war and conflict. Following up on his comments in Singapore, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  writes in The WorldPost that China ought to abide by the rule of law in the seas of Asia and calls for negotiations.  Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar\/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down. South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se  fears a \"Pandora's box\" is being opened in Asia. Marking the 25 years since the Tiananmen massacre, China scholar Perry Link worries that Xi Jinping is becoming \"a Mao-like strongman.\"(continued)","classification":"WORLDPOST","fold":1}

{"index":51766,"text":"Pent-up democratic aspirations were unleashed this week in Myanmar's first free election in decades, resulting in a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi and her opposition party. But as Mark Famaner and Hanna Hindstrom point out, it is \"democracy on a leash\" as the long-standing military rulers retain a constraining foothold through the current constitutional arrangement. It remains to be seen if Suu Kyi's elected government will be \"above\" those constraints, as she has boldly asserted. Writing from Yangon, Ma Thida lays out the many issues in the political transition ahead.\n\nHarrison Akins reminds us that the \"shadow\" over Myanmar's democratic turn is the continuing persecution and discrimination against the Muslim Rohingya minority. \n\nIf it stabilizes, Myanmar could have a bright future. It sits between the two fastest growing economies in the world, India and China, the second of which is revitalizing the ancient Silk Road trading route that George Yeo, Singapore's former foreign minister, sees as making Eurasia the driver of the future global economy.
