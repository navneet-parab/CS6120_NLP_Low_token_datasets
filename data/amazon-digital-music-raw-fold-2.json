{"text":"For those of you who are familiar with the music of The Bangles, they have been called the female equivalent of the Beatles.  Their bright, sweet choral harmonies are enough to capture any listener's attention.  This was one of the bands that I had grown up with alongside Madonna, The Go Go's, and other 80's artists.  After three albums of mega smash after smash, they unfortunately imploded and took a 13 year absence.  Susanna Hoffs would create 2 solo albums, and Vicki\/Debbi Peterson would create their own records under the pseudonym Continental Drifters.\n\nSo once they reunited in 2003 and released this then-new LP, it was as if The Bangles had never left.  Although their voices sounded a bit older, so has their sound matured.  This CD starts off with a fiery one-two punch of the title track sung by Susanna.  Other songs would be very energetic as well -- Debbi's \"Stealing Rosemary\", Vicki's \"Mixed Messages\", and Michael Steele's 2 very important songs (and my personal favorites as well):  \"Nickel Romeo\" and \"Between The Two\".  Check out the lyric \"a Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots...\"  Hint hint, anyone??\n\nThe only 2 songs I did not like were Susanna's \"I Will Take Care Of You\" and Debbi's \"Lost At Sea.\"  But that is only from my personal taste and bears absolutely NO reflection on the band itself!  I was very saddened\/disheartened when Michael Steele eventually left The Bangles permanently, before this decade even started.  So, in other words, you won't hear any of her tracks on the band's 2011 LP, \"Sweetheart Of The Sun.\"  I am somehow okay with that, because in all fairness, each one of the four female members DO have a very unique, distinctive voice and incredible instrumental talent that attracted droves of fans in the first place.\n\nOther than Susanna's recent 2012 solo release, \"Someday\", I'm still betting that The Bangles have some more songs left in them for the rest of this decade to follow!!  :)","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"This review applies solely to the radio edit.\n\nAlright, so I think I've given this song enough tries where I believe I can give a fairly honest review. It's indeed a new move for Daft Punk, using much more vocals and natural instrumentation than before. For some, this works; for others, it may not.\n\nI've been hearing a lot of praise about this song, but also a lot lashing, and this review's primarily directed at those people. I feel that this album, not to mention the song, has been getting much overhype, especially in the weeks and days leading up to the announced single. There's been much more advertisement for this, much more than I recall seeing for their previous albums (though, if I can remember correctly, Discovery had a lot of news too), and that may be because of the proliferation from the Internet and the fact that the musicians are now signed with a much bigger label. Indeed, DP didn't have to worry too much about the scrutiny that comes from the Internet from earlier days.\n\nFrom leaks to edits to remixes, we've heard it all. And now, finally, we're given the first single from their upcoming album, first as a radio edit. This is a substantial departure from their earlier sound. And I have to say: I like it. I like it a lot.\n\nIt seems that they're trying to revive disco, and it seems to work, all the while incorporating their signature sound as well. And, for the first time, the vocals seem to be more \"natural\" this time around; that is, less \"digitized,\" if you will. I admit, I was not enjoying the sound I first heard from Pharrell (despite the extremely catchy SNL ad), though the final version did sound better than the earlier leaks. I thought his voice didn't really add to the DP aesthetic, and the lyrics were very plain.\nBut DP isn't known for their arousing lyrics. They are masters at making the repetitive listenable, and when they do use actual lyrics it's not the worst. But after a few more listens of \"Get Lucky,\" I couldn't help but tap my feet in sync after a while. My co-worker, a big fan of Pharrell, instructed me that Pharrell is first and foremost a producer, a singer secondly.\nOkay, that makes more sense.\nBut still--the lyrics? Surely he could've done better. And that's why I give this review 4 stars. The chorus is fantastic, and DP blows the rest of the song away when they approach the 2:20-ish mark. It is pure DP to the core. But the lyrics could've benefited from some fine-tuning.\n\nIt is, in the end, a great hit, and I can't wait for the whole album.\n\nNow, I won't say I'm a \"true\" Daft Punk fan, because by saying so it makes me sound snobbish, not to mention exclusive in saying DP can't be enjoyed thoroughly by the younger and newer listeners. But I am a longtime fan. I was a wee lad when I first heard \"Da Funk\" as a single on Chicago's B96, and, when I had enough cash saved up, Homework was the first CD I ever bought.\nAnd every new album that came out after I always compared it to Homework, and always was initially disappointed. But today I can tell you with confidence that Discovery is their best album to date, and Homework is a close second. I still have to get Human After All more tries, though I admit it's probably their \"worst,\" even though it's still pretty darn good. (For the record, Alive 2007 is my favorite, purely for the ecstasy of their mixes.)\n\nSo let's all enjoy Daft Punk's brave move into the mesh of disco and electronica, the extreme talent of Nile Rodgers et al., and the album that is to come.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Mott the Hoople was one of those great rock and roll bands that was unfortunately just a tad too quirky to ever be accepted by mainstream audiences.  Though it doesn't contain thier best known song (the David Bowie penned \"All the Young Dudes\"), \"Mott\" still gets the nod as the band's best album.\nThe album features a healthy does of everything that made them great: unpredictable songwriting, fine guitar playing from Mick Ralphs (later of Bad Company), and the theatrical vocals of front man Ian Hunter.  The highlights include the catchy, horn laden \"All the Way from Memphis\" that kicks things off, the sequel to their David Bowie hit \"Hymn for the Dudes,\" the downcast autobiographical story song \"Ballad of Mott the Hoople\" and the goofy but sweet ballad \"I Wish I Was Your Mother\" that closes the record.  In between is a lot of typical Mott glam rock weirdness like \"I'm a Cadilac\" and \"Violence.\"  Though it lacks liner notes, the CD booklet does feature a full lyrics sheet.\nOverall, a terrific classic rock album from an underappreciated band.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"So Trent Reznor has been making music for a long time now and ever since \"With Teeth\", he has been in one of his most prolific periods.\n\nAlso, even since \"With Teeth\", it seems like he has been getting more and more minimalistic with his work.  Do not get me wrong, it is still good and this album as well as his newest one, The Slip, are both awesome.  This is an instrumental work that covers a broad range of musical styles and moods, but as I was saying, it is more and more minimalistic.\n\nIf you are a NIN fan, you must own this.  If you are a fan of electronic music, this might suit you, but you are a fan of only the poppy NIN stuff or the radio hits, this is not the album for you, but on that same note, the entire cd is only 5 bucks, so you might as well check it out and if you do not like it, you are only out a couple of bucks in the end.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Is there such a thing as a perfect album?  (Sgt. Peppers, Blood on the Tracks, New York Tendaberry, Band on the Run?), but this is [IMHO] CLASSIC!  The set opens with the glorious midtempo ballad \"She Never Could Resist A Winding Road\" with a strong guitar driven melody, \"If you love her, better know she loves you now, but soon she'll go.\"  \"Patty Don't You Put Me Down\" recounts a stormy love affair with Thompson's guitar jabbing like thunder and his vocals dripping like acid rain, \"In your ten-watt world, it's beyond any pleasure you know, to stick your fingers in the socket and give yourself a glow.\"  \"You called for me so here I am, not a boy and not a man; man enough to know the odds are long,\" Thompson sings on the slow-tempo \"Broken Doll\" with his guitar plucking pixie-like that counterpoints to the heavy romantic challenge of the lyric.  Delightful!  \"All Buttoned Up\" may not be the most original melody, but it's delivered with such punch that you totally feel the guy's frustration as he tries to consummate his love.  Similarly, \"Long John Silver\" recalls many traditional folk melodies but is delivered with a folk-rock punch and some stellar guitar work.  \"Pony in the Stable\" is also sheer delight with its tightly-wound melody and Thompson's great lyric, \"You've got me where it stings, wrapped around your little finger; Sold off all my things, begging like a carol singer.\"  There are no weak tracks on this set that keeps getting better with repeated play.  Best of the year quality.  Bravo!","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"In 1991,many pop\/rock songs were recorded using the sound of the late 1980's digital percussion. Since Nirvana debuted that same year,many artists like Soundgarden,Green Day and Blues Traveller were copying Nirvana's style. Now for the songs:SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT was the biggest hit from this album. COME AS YOU ARE was another hit. I also like IN BLOOM,BREED and SOMETHING IN THE WAY. This album inspired \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's OFF THE DEEP END album,released in 1992. That album contains SMELLS LIKE NIRVANA which is a parody of SLTS. When Yankovic sings \"a garage band from Seattle\",he refers to Nirvana. The cover photo(from this album) is actually X-rated. There's a naked male baby under swimming pool water intending to grab a dollar bill attached to a hook and fishing line. Sure,it would have been controversial if it was an adult. On the OTDE cover,Yankovic spoofs the NEVERMIND cover by grabbing a donut attached to a hook and fishing line. And yes,Yankovic is wearing a bathing suit. In one of the photos contained in this album,the band's late frontman Kurt Cobain \"flips the bird\". Cobain's fame only lasted over two years,as he committed suicide in April 1994. Surviving are his wife rocker\/actress Courtney Love who's a member of Hole and their daughter Frances Bean,who is currently about 12 or 13 years old. Cobain's death put an end to Nirvana,and another Nirvana member,Dave Navarro,subsequently co-founded and co-formed Foo Fighters. This album was distributed by DGC,which is an acronym for David Geffen Company. DGC's sister label is simply,Geffen which was founded in 1980. Geffen's other clientele,past and present,includes the late John Lennon,Don Henley,Elton John,Guns 'n Roses,Edie Brickell,Bill Cosby and Cher.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since \"Hypocrisy\". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own \"Bells and Whistles\" to stand out from the rest. So on to \"Stabbing the Drama\" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of \"Stabbing the Drama\" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.","classification":1,"fold":2}

Heartthrob is a brief album (just over 36 minutes) that packs a gutsy punch.  Styled in 80s sensibilities (pop, new-wave, electronic production), the sound may be a contrast for the duo, but it is a welcome one. Heartthrob closes the January 2013 slate of releases exceptionally.\n\n\"Closer\" opens the effort with a bright synthetic timbre and a driving beat.  Tegan and Sara deliver solid, commanding vocals that are well produced.  The songwriting is notable, particularly the chorus: \"It's not just all physical \/ I'm the type who won't get oh so critical \/ so let's make things physical \/ I won't treat you like you're oh so typical\".  New wave influence continues to show on \"Goodbye Goodbye\", another crisply produced affair. In addition to another 'hooky' chorus, the bridge stands out, contrasting the verse.  \"I Was a Fool\" continues soundness through solid songwriting, compelling vocals, and fine production work. \"I stuck around \/ I did behave \/ I saved you every time \/ I was a fool for love \/ I was a fool for love\" the duo sing on the chorus. Tegan and Sara are three for three.\n\n\"I'm Not Your Hero\" sports an anthemic pop chorus, continuing lyrics based on romantic themes and the desires of love.  \"Drove Me Wild\" is better, amping up the 80s stylings. Tegan and Sara's vocal approach is perfect, with the duo singing things staccato and in distinct fashion.  Catchy and well written, \"Drove Me Wild\" is a standout cut. \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" loses no luster, sporting slick, electronic production touches.  The vocals features conspicuous processing here, but it suits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut.  The rhythmic nature of the vocals is a selling point. \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" epitomizes 80s pop given an archetypical quick tempo and sound.  Like its contemporaries, \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" is consistent and enjoyable. No misses for Tegan and Sara as of yet.\n\nThe final three cuts don't lose their 'oomph'. \"Love They Say\" may be a shade less compelling than the rest, but not by much. \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" stands out, featuring some memorable lyrics throughout: \"Stay \/ you'll leave me in the morning anyway \/ my heart \/ you'll cut it out you never liked me anyway\" (Verse 1) or \"Stay \/ you come back to me always anyway \/ leave a mark \/ you said you never really loved her anyway...\" (Verse 2).  Closing cut \"Shock To Your System\" is as consistent and nearly as memorable as the very best of the album.\n\nOverall&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Heartthrob\/dp\/B00A4FOWYQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Heartthrob<\/a>&nbsp;is a strong effort from the Canadian duo.

This song came on and one of my high school crushes came and asked me to dance.  It did not matter that he could not dance very well, I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time.

{"text":"CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so-called R&B artists that are out now. Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album. There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony: up. And they did with this superb sophomore release.\n\nThere are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks. Thank You, All Around The World, Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet. I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem, D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake. Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records? Really? I find that type of favoritism questionable. Plus forms of media like Vh1, Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying \"Meh\" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip.\n\n50 Candles, Water Runs Dry, Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost. There are no bad songs on this album so I'll keep going on.\n\nBottom Line: Boyz II Men's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time. The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs aren't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack: harmony. If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you cant go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men.\n\nStandouts: THANK YOU, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, U KNOW, VIBIN, TRYING TIMES, I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU, ON BENDED KNEE, WATER RUNS DRY and YESTERDAY.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Of Dylan's three Christian albums, ascetically this is the best.  SAVED is flat and has too clich to have any true impact for the listener.  SHOT OF LOVE, while having some brilliant moments (although, unfortunately, most of the brilliant moments were left OFF that particular album), never really fully gelled to the vision Dylan seemed to want to take it.  SHOT OF LOVE filled like it was supposed to be a Christian pop album, merging the best of both art forms into a cohesive whole.  When it worked, it really worked (\"Every Grain of Sand.\")  When it didn't, SHOT OF LOVE just sinks.\nAnd what of SLOW TRAIN COMING?  Well, like SHOT OF LOVE, only half of this record truly gels into truly great material.  The first four songs on Side 1 start the album really strong.  Judging from the momentum these songs have, SLOW TRAIN COMING should have a really strong finish, and would have been one of his best albums.  Sadly, Dylan stalls halfway through the album and as a result SLOW TRAIN COMING is greatly weakened.  The rest of the album becomes craftsmanship instead of art.\nThat, perhaps, is the best identifier for SLOW TRAIN COMING.  Dylan's obviously focused on these tracks, and you can tell he wants the album to have a contemporary sound (hence Knopler and his gang).  The first four tracks show's Dylan's brilliance in a Christian context.  The remaining five show Dylan in a focused, workman-like determination to come up with a collection of songs that reflect his new found faith.  While there's nothing particularly wrong with these tracks, there's nothing particularly right with them either.\nInstead of placing the highlights throughout the album, as he did with STREET-LEGAL and SHOT OF LOVE, Dylan chose to put all the good stuff at the beginning.  Perhaps the reason for this is to win sympathy for the album and to carry the record through to the end, but for this listener I just want to push stop and eject after the first four tracks have gone by.  The listening frustration is more intense on SLOW TRAIN COMING because of this fact.  When Dylan strikes gold, he really hits it big time.  The rest just appear as songs that anyone could have written, and sometimes the dogma makes for rather odd songs (\"Man Gave Names To All The Animals\").  \"Man\" is the most interesting track off the second side and that is because it's so strange and musically it's reggae.  Other than that, while Dylan's commitment to his faith and his desire to channel this faith into his art is indeed an admirable cause, in the end there's only about a side here worth really looking at.  The rest are good, just a long way from the brilliance of the first four cuts.\nAs the first album in the Christian Trilogy, it is the best.  The contrast between the brilliant tracks and the just so tracks becomes much more apparent in SHOT OF LOVE than SLOW TRAIN COMING.  The worst material on here still stands as serviceable tracks, just not brilliant tracks.  SHOT OF LOVE, however, is cluttered with material that just barely makes the cut ascetically, yet the brilliant stuff of that album is even better than the first four songs here, so the extremes are more fully realised on SHOT OF LOVE than on SLOW TRAIN COMING.  As for \"Every Grain of Sand,\" nothing here matches that, but that is only one song and one song cannot make an album (listen to \"In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida\" for proof).  We won't even talk about SAVED.\n In relation to STREET-LEGAL, this album seemed to be a natural progression.  Dylan is always one for trying something different and new.  Lyrically, there are cuts on STREET-LEGAL is on rival with the best of his 1960s material.  The last cut (\"Where are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat)\") shows Dylan struggling to find something in his life worth caring about.  Here is the answer to that question.\nBottom line:  Dylan getting religion, while spiritually the most important thing a person can do, only results in fair material with some brilliant moments.  Of his three Christian albums, this is the one to get.  Just like his three longer albums (BLONDE ON BLONDE, SELF-PORTRAIT, and TIME OUT OF MIND), the middle one in this trilogy is an absolute disaster area.  Get SLOW TRAIN COMING, then SHOT OF LOVE, and if you really feel you need to own SAVED, well, go ahead.  Don't say I didn't warn you though.\nMike London\nP. S.  They should have included the outtake \"Ye Shall Be Changed,\" a very good song that would have helped this release out.  It's on THE BOOTLEG SERES VOL 1-3.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Taking it's cues from the modern rock playbook pioneered by Nickelback, 'No Surprise' is decent enough, but not exactly the most memorable song in the world. But while you do remember it, you may remember it fondly with it's quiet verses, and it's slightly predictable chorus.\n\nOverall, not Daughtry's best, but it's decent enough while you wait for his sophomore record to his stores this summer.

Billy Stewart was discovered by the legendary Bo Diddley who was so impressed by his ability to play the piano that he asked Billy to join his band back in 1956. Diddley even got Stewart a recording contract with his record label Chess in the late 1950s. Nothing much came of it for a couple of years but beginning in 1962 he made several outstanding and really unique records. Billy finally struck pay dirt in the summer of 1965 with a beautiful song called \"Sitting In The Park\".

{"text":"Not from lack of trying, and to be honest, I thought this would be a record I would dig from what I've read.  I love bands that experiment, I love electronics, atmospherics like on records produced in New Orleans by Daniel Lanois, and I did hear a brief clip of a song when the album was advertised in a video shown at Target, which sounded pretty cool.  But let me backtrack a little bit.\n\nI absolutely HATED the first album \"Boys & Girls\"...too bluesy and not enough melody and no catchy hooks whatsoever.  I love soul singers, espesh those who rock, like Janis Joplin, Chris Cornell, etc, but they incorporate a melodic sweetness to counteract the raunchy rawness.  AS singer Brittany Howard is a shouter yes, but has no sweetness, it's all full throttle howl, no dynamics. VERY uncomfortable for me to listen to. I hate her tone completely, and last but not least, she is one UGLY woman...I can't even look at photos without gagging!!\n\nFrom what I heard in the video, I thought, hmmm, have they improved??  I like the stylistic change, I took the disc out of the library, and I like the cover and the fact that the vinyl is clear...but I put it on, it started out promising, INSTRUMENTALLY, but once Brittany started, um, \"singing\"??, uh oh...that ugly tone barrelling forth, ruining my brain, I couldn't get past track #2 without risking brain damage...totally unbearable.  Then I open up the booklet, and I see the photos...the rest of the band look like OK guys, kinda cool, but Brittany??\n\nLike Medusa!!  Yikes!!\n\nSorry fans...and there are thousands...I can't understand what you see in this band or Brittnay as a singer...why my taste doe not agree in the slightest is a mystery, but for me, they are clearly America's WORST band by far!!\n\nWorst album of the year, up with the Vaccine's godawful \"English Graffiti\"...\n\nBring on the hate mail, I don't care...just being honest...","classification":1,"fold":2}

{"text":"While I am not a particularly big fan of the music of the 1970's one group that stood head and shoulders above the rest was The Doobie Brothers. Led by vocalist Tom Johnston, this group successfully combined elements of rock 'n roll and R&B and made some of the most memorable music of the decade. And despite a rash of personnel changes along the way the group continued to make great music throughout the 1970's.\n\nIt did not take long for the group to make its mark on the American music scene. Formed in San Jose, Ca. in 1970, the Doobies found themselves riding high on the Billboard Top Pop Singles Chart when in the fall of 1972 their debut release \"Listen To The Music\" leaped all the way to #11. Quite an accomplishment! Then in April 1973 Warner Brothers released \"Long Train Runnin'\" which would become the group's first Top Ten record.

{"text":"Full disclosure - Jeff Lynne and Bryan Adams are among my all-time favourite artists. Bryan has been my favourite solo artist since was 11 and first heard Summer of 69 (back in '89) and I discovered ELO a couple of years later and they remain second only to Queen in my all-time favourite groups. So you can imagine my excitement when I read that Jeff and Bryan were teaming up. But it also means I'm going to be more positive about this album than the average BA fan.\n\nGet Up sounds more like a Jeff Lynne solo album with Bryan Adams singing. Even though Jeff only has a writing credit on one song, his production influences here cover almost every second of the albums short running time. Drums (which Jeff played), riffs, bass, melody, it's pure Jeff Lynne. More Jeff than Bryan.\n\nWith Jeff doing the bulk of the instruments, the absence of the usual \"Dudes of Leisure\" makes this album sound more like ELO's Zoom or anything Jeff's been involved in (including the Traveling Wilbury's and related artists that Jeff produced solo stuff of) since the break-up of ELO in the 80's. When Jeff Lynne's ELO release a new album in a few weeks the comparisons will be interesting to listen to.\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Bryan sent Jeff some lyrics he and Jim Vallance had written and Jeff laid down all the backing tracks to his liking and sent it back to Bryan to sing over.\n7 of the 9 songs clock in at less than 3 minutes and many of them come and go before you've had a chance to really get into them. But none overstay their welcome and their short running times should suit todays lower attention spans.\n\nThe Bad:\n25min runtime for the 9 proper tracks doesn't really classify as a full album\nMany of the lyrics have a clichd and recycled feel to them. \"What goes around comes around\", \"you gotta keep both feet on the ground\" , \"Two hearts are better than one\", \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\", some are quite uninspired.\n\nThe tracks:\nYou Belong To Me - is a country\/Traveling Wilbury's inspired catchy little opening number. Not that out of place in the BA catalogue and one of the highlights.\nGo Down Rockin' - yes Bryan, you keep on rockin'. This, and the other track with rock in the title, however, are the weakest tracks. A song with a message though.\nWe Did It All - is the first of two ballads. The Jeff Lynne influence is very evident here. Some dodgy lyrics but a nice number.\nThat's Rock'n'Roll - is perhaps a bit corny and certainly not a highlight but also not a bad track. Just hardly memorable and something thats too familiar.\nDon't Even Try - showcases Jeff's love of the Del Shannon sound. Very 50's\/early Beatles inspired. Another nice number, especially for the Jeff fans.\nDo What Ya Gotta Do - is another one of these OK but hardly memorable tracks. Pure filler with some more dodgy lyrics.\nThunderbolt - is almost great and the bridge(?) halfway through certainly raises the song from filler to worthy.\nYesterday Was Just A Dream - is perhaps the most Bryan sounding song here. Very Room Service\/On A Day Like Today era. It is perhaps my favourite track on the album. Love it. Its a shame it ends kind of abruptly just when you expect it to take off even further.\nBrand New Day - might just be the catchiest song he's done in 20 years. Love it\n\nThen come the acoustic versions of four of the previous songs. Not really something that should make up album tracks, but simply should be bonus tracks. Which leaves the album at least two songs (or 7-8 minutes) short of what most would consider a full album\n\nYou Belong To Me, Thunderbolt, Yesterday Was Just A Dream and Brand New Day are the keepers. Maybe throw in We Did It all.\n\nSo all in all a good album. The Jeff Lynne \/ Bryan Adams combo was a success sonically but there's not enough going on here to raise this album into classic status. Perhaps they needed more time together to flesh out a few more tracks.\nMaybe on par with 11, the good songs on Get Up are better than the good songs on 11, but the lesser tracks here are far from memorable. 11 grew on me over time but I cant see me liking this more in 5 years than I do now. Hard to compare, though, given this albums low track list and short running time. I certainly wasn't disappointed with this one the way I was with 11 after the fantastic Room Service.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"It's nice to have the old Tori back. Well, shades of the old Tori. What can I possibly say about Tori Amos that I haven't already said in previous reviews? Gorgeous, melodic voice? Check. Moving and life-changing songs? Check. Gifted pianist? Check. A truly unique artist? Check. Back in 1992, Tori made a splash with her debut, \"Little Earthquakes\". I was only 10 years-old when that record was released but I vividly remember the first time I saw the music video for \"Silent All These Years\". I was amazed and a little scared of this unusual, flame-haired singer\/songwriter. There was a deep sadness in her eyes and yet an undeniable fire as well. \"Silent All These Years\" left a lasting impact on me but it would take until Tori's 4th studio album, \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" released in 1998, (a fabulous year for music) to make me a bona-fide fan of her music. There are some musicians that are special. Tori is one of those people. Throughout my teenage\/early adult years, her albums became a much-needed lifeline for me. I guess you could say a lot of her rabid fans are labeled as \"sensitive souls\" and \"outcasts\". Well, those stereotypes are perfectly fine with me because it's kind of true. Tori's music was both refreshing and earth-shattering. The tone of her voice, cryptic lyrics, and beautiful arrangements were effortless. She was dubbed \"The Goddess of Weird\" and my god, did I lap up her weirdness. There was a realness to her that was infectious. She didn't pretend to be someone she wasn't. She was mainstream and underground all at the same. Tori could tap into deep-seated emotions and turn it on its head. She wasn't afraid to tell the truth. Her words had power. She didn't play by the rules. She was an unstoppable force of creativity. A beacon of light. A nonconformist. An advocate.\n\nAnd then something unexpected happened to Tori's music with the 2009 release of \"Abnormally Attracted To Sin\". Her music became dull and uninspired. It was the first time I felt disappointed after hearing one of her albums. I didn't hate it but it definitely felt like the beginning of the end. Also around this time, Tori was starting to experiment with something besides music. Plastic surgery. She became unrecognizable to me. Her vanity got the best of her. In some ways, I felt like she stopped caring about the music. It was like she had given up. I also realized something else, Tori wasn't perfect - she's human just like everybody else. In 2011, Tori released her first classical album, the underwhelming, \"Night of Hunters\". My first Tori album I grew to despise. Lyrically - it was very strong. Musically - it was a disaster. The haunting melodies were gone. Her voice was starting to show signs of wear and tear. I swore to never buy another Tori Amos record again. She had disappointed me for the last time until...\n\nThis year when \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" was released in May. When I first heard the samples, I blew it off. The music sounded stale and routine, but I did notice her voice was getting stronger again. It took a full month for me to get \"into\" the samples and then I broke down and bought it. I just want to say this is NOT her best album. But thank god it's not a train wreck like her last 2 studio albums were. I think the title of this album is incredibly pretentious but besides that, \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" is a subtle and pretty record. There's a few tracks I think have missed the mark completely like: \"16 Shades of Blue\", \"Maids of Elfen-Mere\", \"Promise\", and \"Rose Dover\". Those 4 songs tend to drag in places. And then there's some tracks that are absolutely stunning like the haunting, \"Wild Way\", the jangly, \"Trouble's Lament\", and the gorgeous closer, \"Invisible Boy\". The BEST track is \"Oysters\". This song is full of imagery and Tori's vocals are both soaring and chilling. Tori sounds confident on this record. The music is simple but melodic. \"Weatherman\" is classic Tori and \"Giant's Rolling Pin\" feels like a nursery rhyme on steroids. So incredibly odd but catchy. The title track is the most experimental song on the album and \"America\" is moody and introspective. \"Wedding Day\" has an awesome rhythmic guitar lick and \"Selkie\" has an ethereal, folkloric feel to it. Unfortunately Tori is STILL vain but I'm glad she's back composing deep and meaningful music. \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" might have some clunkers here and there, but I truly feel I haven't heard Tori sound this happy and focused in such a long time. But in keep in mind, Tori's music isn't as groundbreaking like it used to be, but it still has a pulse - a racing pulse. But I sometimes can't help but think Tori's problems are external. I really feel she would benefit by having an outside producer. Someone to shake up her signature sound a bit. But I know that probably won't ever happen since Tori is sort of a control freak when it comes to her music. I appreciate Tori toning down on the whole, \"every album should have a concept\" thing. Some of her previous studio albums, even the good ones had a tendency of being long and bloated. \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" has quality over quantity. It's straight-forward without being forced or contrived. A lovely pop album from a lovely woman. Tori's 20+ career is astonishing. It's downright frightening how smart she is. She can make you feel joyful, sad, angry, and defiant with just one song. Her music has made me a more conscientious and empathetic person. I know that sounds corny but without her brutal honesty and fearless heart - I don't think I would be such a well-adjusted (if slightly neurotic) human being. All bets are off. Tori is here to stay. Pedestal is back in place. Enjoy!\n\n\"And I can almost out run you and those stalking memories\/Did I somehow become you without realizing?\/Found a little patch of heaven now\/So then I'm gonna turn oysters in the sand\/'Cause I'm working my way back to me again\/Not every girl is a pearl, with these ruby slippers...\" - From the song, \"Oysters\".","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Man, I have said it countless times before, and I will proudly say it at least once more again: Green Day is pure, hardcore, pro-capitalist, money-making, radio- and Disney Channel-friendly punk at its very best! If you don't think that Green Day and drummer Tre Cold are the most hardcore incarnation of punk since the Sex Pistols and the Dead Kennedys, then you must be a poser-teen who loves watching Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel!\n\nI also tremendously respect and enjoy how Green Day have just become increasingly loyal to the punk ethos. A great example of this is putting out a \"new\" \"CD\" every couple of months since last September in order to make as much money as absolutely possible and cement their reigning status among the 1-percenters of America and the world! If this is not the very epitome of anti-establishment rebellion and social justice that punk epitomizes, then I bet you also think that Barack Obama is just a wealth-redistributing socialist Marxist!!!!\n\nAnywho, on to the songs, all of which are the very embodiment of punk rawk! Take Brutal Love, as just one example, the unbelievably catchy pop hooks and woo-woo choruses easily make it among the very best pure-punk songs that have ever been devised. To boot, Tre's mad drumming--that is easily at home on a Hannah Montana record or, better yet, a Spice Girls live DVD offering!--is just punktastic! This can easily be said about many of the songs on Tre because Green Day is so, you know, original and not derivative at all with their songs. A Little Boy Named Train is a bit of a weird inclusion here because it is all about Green Day's love and devotion to the band Train. However, now that I have thought about this for a little bit longer, I agree that its inclusion makes perfect sense since Train, too, is the very epitome of one of the hardest, most aggressive and anti-establishment punk bands that has ever crawled out of the San Fran Bay Area (Hi Nancy Pelosi!!).\n\nIn short, I urge you to go out right now and purchase Tre, thereby helping Green Day perhaps become among the even more elitist 0.5-percenters! Now that Obama has won reelection with a stunning and powerful mandate that is defined by barely getting more than 50 percent of Americans' votes! If you don't buy Tre, then I guess you're just a Nick and Disney Channel poser!","classification":4,"fold":2}

However, there is a rarer quality of a movie song, one that if you have not seen said movie, but you here the song first, and you love the song so much that you actually want to see the movie. That is what this song does. While watching these past Oscars they played the nominees for best movie song of the year, and I thought to myself, it all seems so fake. The song from \"August Rush\" completely missed the mark it was trying to achieve, and \"Enchanted\" with the exception of \"So Close,\" sounded like typical Disney type fair.\n\nHowever, then came, \"Falling Slowly,\" a song from a widely unknown film, I was like, \"Wow, this is really different, this is beautiful!\" And it was all that and more, and the studio version only improved on these precious elements. It's a moving, gentle song that really touches your heart. And like I said, I liked the song so much, I now want to see the actual movie, \"Once.\"\n\nOverall, the surprise song of the year, and a feel-good story that these unknown musicians are finally getting the credit and recognition they deserve. Buy this song, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nBy the way, get this version, there's a longer version that was put out, and it's not as good, because the song seems a little bit too spontaneous and drawn out, and it also loses some of the elements that makes the soundtrack version so great.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the score for San Andreas.  On the one hand, it does what it's supposed to do well - one would expect nothing less with a composer as competent as Andrew Lockington at the helm.  On the other hand, I really did not enjoy it as much as I was hoping I would.\n\nAlthough I love a good disaster movie, I've seen too many of them at this point and based on what I've seen and heard about the film so far it looks to be more of the same.  By analogy, the score is similar: it has great moments of inspiration, but in general it's more of the same type of thundering intensity that you'd expect to accompany a disaster piece.\n\nThe main theme is fantastic, as are all the instances of vocal elements used throughout the score.  They are used sparsely, which makes their use all the more effective - every moment of peace in a score this relentless is one to savor.  I have not seen the film yet, but my guess is that many of these choral moments play over the sweeping wide shots of the damage and destruction.\n\nI don't care for much of the score beyond that - I'm sure the intense and suspenseful bits will play great against the mayhem on screen, but it's personally not what I enjoy when listening to on an album.\n\nThe album closes with a cover of \"California Dreamin\" by Sia (you've likely heard it used in the movie's trailer).  It's a perfectly fine cover and a welcome addition to the soundtrack, though it's nowhere near my favorite rendition of the song.\n\nIn short, I won't recommend this album for everyone; but you gotta at least buy that Main Theme!\n\nFavorite Tracks:\n[1] Main Title\n[10] Need a News Feed\n[23] End Credits","classification":4,"fold":2}

That's not to say that you shouldn't spend the 99 cents for this collection.\n\nThe benefits are, is that you don't have to download them to your Amazon music account (and thereby using some of your paltry 5GB music space allowance) and, two, you can access this and any other songs or albums you own from your Amazon purchases from any internet-ready source.\n\nI especially like this collection because of the number of tracks.  I don't have to worry about getting up and looking for something else to put on when I'm reading.  This uninterrupted time is very good for long reading stretches.\n\nCalm, peaceful and reading-sitting ready music.\n\n5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"It is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since Alicia Keys came out of the music industry, and has shown that her work, her voice and her style have been both sophisticated, and her songs have been brilliant and shown a young woman who has written soulful and brilliant songs that have never gotten out of style. It is so sad that many of today's divas like Rihanna, Beyonce' and Katy Perry, just haven't even shown a brilliance in soul and songwriting that has really stood the test of time. It is so sad that many of today's divas so far never will have Alicia Keys style and strength in song. When she came out with Songs In A Minor back in 2001, it really was a game changer when a lot of soul music was deeply overlooked in regards to rap and hip hop throughout the 90's. The song that started it all for Alicia Keys, Fallin', still remains simply soulful and striking from each and every not Alicia put into the song. She definitely showed that she can not only sing, but Alicia can have style in song from beginning to end. I like this is song a whole lot. If you have never heard a Alicia Keys song before, well this is the first one I suggest you download for your music library.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Since this album contains both `Animal' and `Cannibal' I just decided to post my reviews for both albums here.  There is nothing special that comes from buying this version other than you save a buck or two depending on where you buy it from.  It would have been nice had she given us some B-Side tracks or some remixes or something that validated buying the album, but then again, if you don't own either and want them both then get this one.\n\nFirst; `Animal':\n\n\"When Ke$ha blew up the radio waves with `TiK ToK' I was kind of bewildered.  I mean, the song was catchy and fun to a degree, but she sounded BEYOND drunk and shallow to an extreme, and when she started getting nominated for Grammy's I was taken even further back.  I mean, she didn't seem to have a lot of talent.\n\nI finally got out of my own head and decided to buy this album and check it out.\n\nI get it now.\n\nI've been listening to this album (along with `Cannibal' and her new remix album) nearly non-stop for the last couple weeks and I'm still wrapped up in it.  It's flawed, sure.  There are some songs on this album that just don't work that well, but overall there is far too much good here to dismiss Ke$ha as a talentless hack, sucked into the media storm surrounding her strange sense of style.  She isn't just a `dirty little freak' given more credit than is due.  If anything, she isn't regarded as well as she should be.  This girl not only has a voice (stop acting drunk Ke$ha, you have pipes so use them more) but she has swagger that makes her songs infectious.  As much as I claimed to dislike her for so long, I NEVER change the station when one of her songs comes on since, well, I love listening to this girl.\n\nI mean, who doesn't find something strangely endearing about Ke$ha's onslaught of radio singles?  The albums singles aren't completely indicative of this artist as a whole (maybe I shouldn't go so far as to call her an artist) but it doesn't hurt the cause.  `TiK ToK' may be the worst overall single, and it's still a fun and flirty song that sticks in your head.  `Your Love Is My Drug' is above and beyond my favorite song by Ke$ha.  It is just so boisterous and bouncy and fun and insanely catchy.  It was one of the first POP songs I learnt to play on the guitar, and this was all before I admitted to myself that I liked this girl, the song is that good.  `Take It Off' is just such a ridiculously filthy club track that is filthy in all the right ways.  If this doesn't illicit endless hours of rave-like gyrating then I don't know what will.  `Dancing With Tears In My Eyes' is another side, a softer side, to Ke$ha.  It isn't her best trip down this isle (`Hungover', without doubt or question) but this side to Ke$ha is nicely constructed here.  It retains her catchy pop style, but it adds a layer of heartbreak that sits on her well.\n\nAs good as the singles are, the rest of the album mostly exceeds her promise.\n\nMy favorite tracks on the album, outside of `Your Love Is My Drug' include the lovelorn `Hungover', the vengeful anthem `Kiss and Tell', the achingly sincere `Blind' and the throwback jingle `Backstabber'.  `Backstabber' is such a cool change of pace, recalls to mind an almost modernized jazz feel with elevated club beats and feisty lyrics.  `Kiss and Tell' rides the same vein as `Your Love Is My Drug' in the musical department, this song taking a different lyrical approach (that of a cheating boyfriend).  The chorus is catchy as all get out and it is just a load of bouncy fun.  `Hungover' is soft and gentle and is the closest thing to `haunting' Ke$ha has on the album.  `Blind' is just beautifully constructed.  It shows that vulnerable side to Ke$ha, and strips away her trademark `drunk singing' and shows us what she can really do vocally.  Why wasn't this song a single?  Why didn't they introduce her as a more serious contender to the pop world?  She has more talent (vocally) than Britney Spears and yet whoever was in charge of her exposure botched that up.\n\n`Blah Blah Blah' is fun and fresh.  It feels a little dated, but in a fun way.  Ke$ha does fall into the whole `shallow' category thanks to her endless barrage of ill-advised lyrics, but it doesn't mean she isn't fun.  She's not as artistically focused as Lady Gaga, so she can't always get away with the density of lyrics, but she understands her audience very well, so it kind of doesn't matter.  `Animal' is a good song, but I think the remix album spoiled me, since the `Switch Remix' is just so brilliant.\n\n`Steven' is okay, and it is a different song for her (although the obvious Imogen Heap inspired opener is kind of obnoxious).  The song grows on you, but it just doesn't work as well as the majority of the album.  I feel about `Boots and Boys' kind of how I feel about `Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' by Gaga; painfully tacky by fun nonetheless.  `Party at a Rich Dudes House' is fun but dumb and does nothing for Ke$ha as an artist.\n\n`Dinosaur' is just bad.\n\nSo, in the end, as you can see, I really like this girl.  There, I said it.  I know, it totally makes no sense but what can I say; she delivers.  If you are expecting something truly original or something that will stand the test of time then LOOK ELSEWHERE, but if you want some primo-pop that will get you moving and will surpass your expectations then sink into this one.\n\nIt's far better than you think it is!\"\n\nSecond; `Cannibal':\n\n\"Despite the fact that the Billboard Remix of `Animal' is superb and `Blow' is just, well, perfect; this album just doesn't do it for me.  There are only nine tracks here and the majority of them feel cheap and rushed and unfocused and nowhere near the level of surprise and excitement that I felt when listening to `Animal'.\n\nSo yeah, `Blow' is awesome and just works like magic.  The bass lines are explosive and the overall energy is insane here.  Her best club track, period.  I love that breakdown at the end (\"make it rain on em\"), but the entire song is flawless.  The Billboard Remix of `Animal' has most of the haunting texture that was accomplished in the `Switch Remix' on her `Dance Commander' album.  It's eerie and complex and layered beautifully; just superb.\n\n`The Harold Song' is soft and pretty, and the chorus swells upward with perfect pitch, but it feels less entrancing than her better attempts at that vulnerable sound.  `Sleazy' is fun, although the remix featuring Andre 3000 is FAR better.  It's fun and flirty though, and so you'll enjoy it.  `C U Next Tuesday' is a different sound for Ke$ha and it works to a degree.  It isn't too memorable, but it has a dreamy quality that is kind of enchanting while you are listening to it.\n\nOK, I kind of like `Grow a Pear', although I have to say that it is the definition of tacky and doesn't really work, despite the pre-chorus being kind of brilliant (\"you should kno-o-oo-oo-ooow\").  It's a crazy song really, and for shock value it works (she says mangina, so she gets props for that) but it's also kind of beyond stupid.\n\nI like `We R Who We R' to a certain degree, but it's probably my least favorite single she's released.\n\n`Cannibal' has a nice beat and all but it's also just downright tacky with no real substance or point.  This is Ke$ha buying into what the media wants her to be; a trashy whore.  She is better than this, and she even shows us that in moments of the song where her vocals far outweigh the disgustingly shallow material.  The tribal beat is kind of cool, but I hate the thoughtless lyrical content.  `Crazy Beautiful Life' is also rather vapid to tell you the truth, but the bouncy `Blue October'-lite beat almost makes up for the content.\n\nThis album would have been MUCH better had it had five or six more tracks with some substance.  I mean, this is kind of like taking what she did in `Animal' and cutting it in half, and you needed those extra tracks to make up for missteps and add that something special to the album.  Instead it comes off a tad halfhearted.\"\n\nIn conclusion, this works quite well and I have no regrets over indulging in some teenage pop trashiness that is far better than I expected it to be.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Right now this is one of my two favorite new cd's.  The other being In Flames \"A sense of Purpose.\"I'd say with a little more time this album could have been that much better, but like all Sevendust albums it's still quite good.  They throw in quite a bit of variety which I love.  There are also more guitar solos than any other Sevendust album, as far as I remember.  On a scale of of 1-10 I'd give this a solid 7 maybe 8.  I'm enjoying this one more and more every time I hear it.\n\nInside - this one has an intro that goes on a little too long for my taste, but when the song gets going it's one of my favorites on the album.  It's a kind of alpha-esque song with a solid riff and good drum beat.  Probably the heaviest song on the album.  I wish they had expanded on the bridge a little and maybe put an instrumental break, but still it's a great song.  9\/10\n\nEnough - This one's a decent enough rocker.  I don't have a whole lot to say about it except that it's an enjoyable song.  7\/10\n\nHope - This is probably my favorite song, either this or inside.  Musically I think it's the most diverse on the album.  I like the main riff and the solo.  The stringed instruments during the solo were cool as well.  10\/10\n\nScapegoat - This one has kind of quieter verses with some electronics and a heavy very catchy chorus.  Some of the lyrics in this one for me are a bit... but I'm a sucker for a catchy chorus and it is still a good song.  8\/10\n\nFear - Another good song.  This one like Enough I don't have a whole lot to talk about.  It's kind of a mid-tempo rocker with some cool musical pieces thrown in  7\/10\n\nThe Past - My least favorite song on the album, not because of the writting.  The song is well written.  It's an acoustic song.  I just can't get into Daughtry's voice.  It reminds me too much of the guy from Shinedown.  Still it's not a bad song and right now I'm not minding hearing it.  6\/10\n\nProdigal Son - A mid-tempo rocker that I really like.  There's just something about the vocals in this one that I really like.  Something about them just sound different from what Lajon has done in the past, but I can't put my finger on it.  There's also a short, but decent solo.  8\/10\n\nLifeless - This one's a little faster than a mid-tempos song.  It's a rocker with a quieter chorus.  There's also another decent guitar solo.  I hope they keep using solos from now on.  8\/10\n\nSorrow - This one's another slower one with the lead singer from Alter Bridge.  Yesterday at work I had this one going through my head.  I like the main riff.  They use a cool effect, I think it's either a chorus or flange, but it's been a long time since I've played with guitar effects so I can't remember.  Kennedy's voice sounds different than I remember on any Alter bridge album.  I hope for their next one he uses this style for a song or two.  8\/10\n\nContradiction - This is another of my favorites.  This is another rocker.  I like the chorus it's kind of different from a typical Sevendust chorus.  9\/10\n\nWalk Away - This is another solid track and a good album closer.  There's more screaming in this one than any other song except maybe for Inside.  9\/10\n\nI'd review the bonus tracks as well, but I don't feel like it.  I'll just say that they're pretty solid as well.  You've got Lucky One and Disgust which are heavier and Heart in your hands which is slower.  Still they're enjoyable.\n\nThis may not be my favorite Sevendust Album, but it's certainly not a bad one.\n\nI think most Sevendust fans will find this one a good addition to their collection.","classification":4,"fold":2}

To me they will always be the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, and no-one can tell me otherwise, although looking back I now realize I never was entirely sure how Michelangelo defeated his foes with nothing more dangerous than a slice of pizza. This has been an astonishingly long-lived franchise  with the world having already been exposed to three separate animated TV series, a Japanese anime, a live-action TV series, we are now on our fifth movie based on the characters originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984, following the original three movies in 1990, 1991 and 1993, and the 2007 CGI flop TMNT. This latest installment is essentially an origin story reboot of the entire story, stars Megan Fox and Will Arnett, and is directed by Jonathan Liebesman.\n\nThe music of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films doesnt have the most distinguished history; Monty Python music maestro John Du Prez scored the first three films, but very little of his music saw the light of day on CD, and Klaus Badelt wrote a decent but little-remembered action score for TMNT in 2007. Enter Brian Tyler; having become Marvels go-to guy for music, with the scores for Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World already under his belt, and the score for Avengers: Age of Ultron yet to come, Tyler looks set to challenge Hans Zimmer for the title of King of All Super-Heroes, and his score for the Turtles continues the trend of him writing strong, powerful, thematic orchestral scores in the grandest symphonic traditions.\n\nBrian Tyler has been writing wonderful music for Jonathan Liebesmans films for over a decade, ever since he scored the directors feature debut, Darkness Falls, in 2003, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continues the trend. Anyone who has listened to a Brian Tyler action score in the last four or five years will know exactly what to expect: a large orchestra, a large choir, a strong main theme, lots of complicated action writing, and a sense of scale and volume that few composers can match these days. The main theme, first heard in the opening cue Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and reprised fully in the conclusive TMNT March, is a belter: brass-heavy, powerful, heroic, and often accompanied by a soaring choir. It has a few superficial similarities to his themes from both Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3, but on the whole this is immaterial. Tyler is pretty much the only guy writing memorable, recurring themes for super hero movies these days, and we need to be thankful for that fact alone.\n\nThe action music, by and large, is fast, dense, and lots of fun. Cues like the astonishing Splinter vs. Shredder, Turtles United, Shellacked, Shortcut, Cowabunga, and the enormously exciting Adrenaline are barnstormers. Most of them feature strong performances of the main theme, and all are embellished by flamboyant touches in the string phrasing, the brass countermelodies, and in the percussion patterns that underpin everything. Splinter vs. Shredder and Shortcut are especially noteworthy, with their chanted choral parts, back-and-forth brass writing, furiously slashing string runs, complicated rhythmic elements, and general sense of epic grandeur. For the most part, the electronic elements of the score are kept to a bare minimum, simply doubling the percussion or adding a secondary level of bubbling bass. Its unobtrusive, but maintains a level of coolness for contemporary audiences.\n\nBy way of comparison, some of the brass triplets remind me a little of James Horners most recent action music, especially scores such as Avatar and The Amazing Spider-Man, while some of horn\/flute trills recall Michael Giacchinos Star Trek music. Similarly, the penultimate cue Buck Buck has a touch of the best parts of Hans Zimmers Man of Steel about it; to be clear, all of these things are good things.\n\nTo hint at the Oriental origins of the quartet, Tyler peppers his music with an occasional taste of the land of the rising sun, with trilling Japanese bamboo flutes and immense taiko drums underpinning several tracks. Cues such as the aforementioned Splinter vs. Shredder, Origins and Shredder play up this aspect of the score, and give it a different flavor than some of its contemporaries that is very appealing.\n\nIf Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a downside, its its total and utter lack of subtlety. Im not saying that a comic book film about crime fighting amphibians requires the restraint and sensitivity that a more grounded movie needs  things need to be larger-than-life  but Tyler scores almost every scene in the film with apocalyptic bombast, as though every moment is the most important moment of the story, and by the end of the 70-minute album I can anticipate some listeners will find the whole thing a little overwhelming. Theres very little sense of anticipation, build-up and catharsis; the score whangs you over the head from the first moment of the first cue, and continues whanging you over the head virtually the entire time until its all over.\n\nAs such, there only a few moments of downtime. Adolescent Genetically Altered Shinobi Terrapins has some soothing choral work, an intimate piano element, and a mystery-shrouded little cello figure reminiscent of Tia Dalmas theme from the third Pirates of the Caribbean film. Later, Origins features some lovely harp glissandi, Brotherhood features an emotional string-and-choir theme that is quite exquisite, and Rise of the Four revisits the emotional choral panache heard during the opening moments of the first cue, before segueing into yet another rousing performance of the main theme. Finally, at the very end of Buck Buck a soothing electronic guitar element comes to take center stage, providing a sentimental, but defiantly contemporary coda to all the chaos.\n\nHaving covered those caveats, I have to say that in terms of sheer entertainment value, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of the most enjoyable scores of 2014 for me so far. Unpretentious scores which kick ass while wearing their hearts on their sleeves are hard to come by these days; too many scores, especially in the super hero genre, have begun take themselves far too seriously, eschewing escapist entertainment in favor of tortured, dark tales of retribution and twisted morality. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the antidote to all that, but being unpretentious and entertaining doesnt mean sacrificing musical creativity or compositional dexterity, which Tyler once again proves he has in spades.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"All of Type O Negative's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full-length. For example, really memorable, Sabbath-inspired guitar riffing, good solos, prominent, grumbling bass lines, Peter Steele's masculine yet limpid vocals (including a baritone that is so deep, it almost matches his bass sound), both humorous and depressing lyrics, creepy keyboards, well-written melodies, bullying grooves, gothic overtones, occasional psychedelic sounds, and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band's famous arsenal.\n\nBut there is also an intangible something and feeling of greatness present on 2007's \"Dead Again,\" making it easily their finest release since 1996's iconic \"October Rust.\" For one, there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and\/or recycling old material (which was something that some fans believed to be the case on 1999's \"World Coming Down\" and 2003's \"Life Is Killing Me\"), because they now sound as inspired, energetic, and all-around strong as ever! Plus, they can't be said to exactly reinvent the genre here, but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here, these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing  and unpredictable quality. The album shuffles back and forth between several different moods and genres, including really heavy doom metal, sludge, thrash (thus showing-off Steele's roots in the genre, as a founding member of Carnivore), goth metal, industrial, and progressive and traditional rock. It is viscerally heavy and frequently quite fast, yet (in true T.O.N. style), it also retains a certain level of control and tunefulness throughout. Suffice it to say, this is one very rewarding, well-rounded, and epically epic piece of music. In addition, at 77 minutes in length (!), it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans' appetites for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe terrifically ominous and choir-abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note. It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove, strong bass work throughout, and a sing-song-y chorus to add catchiness. \"Tripping A Blind Man\" works similarly: An old-school Black Sabbath-meets-Eighties thrash (i.e., say, Megadeth) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing and breakneck when blazing tempos, fast guitar leads, and an exceptional solo (near the end) slam onto the scene. \"The Profits Of Doom\" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Deep Purple, and Alice In Chains. It is a slow and extremely progressive, slow-burning, brooding, and trance-inducing epic which nears the eleven minute mark and has thunderous, trudging power chords that weigh a ton, a beefy bottom-end completed by noteworthy, and dirty, grungy-sounding bass lines, and vocals that trade-off between growling, eerie spoken-words, and impressive, proper singing.\n\nOn the flip side, \"September Sun\" is a very pretty, somber, textured, tranquil, and emotionally-moving Alice Cooper-esque ballad that is peppered with cool piano keys, melodic strings, and warm and powerful crooning. The lyrics are also worth mentioning here, because they are so sad and dark that it wouldn't be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener's throat. Next up, \"Halloween In Heaven\" is much catchier and more accessible than usual. Here, a memorable, driving, stoner metal-ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring, clean backing female vocals. At fourteen and-a-half-minutes long, song number six, \"These Three Things,\" takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here. It is an extremely dark, goth-y, and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work, but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets, and lots of nice subtleties, atmosphere, and mood-enhancers.\n\nTaking a break from their more experimental side, \"She Burned Me Down\" is more proof that, when they want to, Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them, and is highlighted by excellent, mesmerizing riffage, emotional vocals, and a fiery and winding guitar solo. \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" again takes things into an up-tempo pace; in fact, one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune. It is centered around storming (and sometimes almost punk-y) drumming (including a few bass kicks), call-and-response choruses, and a steadfastly meaty and sludgy bass bottom. The curiously entitled \"An Ode To Locksmiths\" boasts a leather-clad rock `n' roll vibe, tasty, crunchy, lumbering guitars, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. Finally, the closing \"Hail And Farewell To Britain\" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory, with a bass-heavy mix, big, fat, chugging guitar riffs, lock-step-unison rhythms, and a great keyboard solo.\n\nCutting to the chase, \"Dead Again\" is, quite simply, one very amazing album, and an essential listen. And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders; hence, contrary to its misleading title, it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive\/lively. However, in an oh-so-cruel twist-of-fate, Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010, at the age of 48. But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N., at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career, and unquestionably went out on the absolute top.\n\nR.I.P. Peter, you will be missed.","classification":5,"fold":2}

There are some that could've been better that really caused him to lose his way on the X album like Sing and Don't which took his heart a little too far into his influences in Hip Hop. Unfortunately he wasn't really as strong as he was with his songwriting. But honestly, he has gotten back up on his feet with great songs with Thinking Out Loud, the third single from the X album. The song really is a strong and eloquent ballad that holds up with his best in song, just like he had made when The A Team came out a few years ago.

His solo songs away from The Police have made him more of a brilliant songwriter, and just timeless with each and every note. One of Sting's deepest songs, Fragile from his second album, Nothing Like The Sun has remained brilliant and vividly deep from the soul he has sung it with every time you listen to him.

This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall \"laid-back\" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a \"celebrity\" but as more of a \"grandfatherly\" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and \"Rudolph\" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of \"Little Drummer Boy\" that I've heard! \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be \"Christmas Can't Be Far Away.\" The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is (under 30 minutes). It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff, or had been paired with Burl Ives' Christmas Album (which contains completely different material). But still, this is a wonderful album!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"The Track List\n\nThis review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:\n\nOverture\nThe Grid\nFather and Son\nThe Son of Flynn\nEncom Part I\nEncom Part II\nRecognizer\nArmory\nArena\nRound One\nRinzler\nThe Game Has Changed\nOutlands\nAdagio For Tron\nNocturne\nOutlands, Part II\nReflections\nEnd Of Line\nCastor\nDerezzed\nFall\nSea of Simulation\nRectifier\nDisc Wars\nC.L.U.\nArrival\nFlynn Lives\nSunrise Prelude\nTron Legacy (End Titles)\nSolar Sailer\nFinale\n\nThe Pieces\n\nOverture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.\n\nThe Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.\n\nFather and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.\n\nThe Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.\n\nEncom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.\n\nRecognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.\n\nArmory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.\n\nArena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.\n\nThe Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.\n\nOutlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.\n\nAdagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.\n\nNocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.\n\nReflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.\n\nEnd of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.\n\nFall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.\n\nSea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.\n\nRectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.\n\nDisc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.\n\nC.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.\n\nArrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.\n\nFlynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.\n\nSunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.\n\nTron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.\n\nSolar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).\n\nFinale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.\n\nThe Score\n\nTron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).\n\nThe first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.\n\nSome have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...\n\nThis score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.\n\nToo Many Adagios?\n\nIt appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.\n\nSome have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).\n\nFlynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement\n\nWhen I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).\n\nIt would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Beautiful things happen when young talents take guidance from the old heads. The proficient, dexterous youngster, Bishop Nehru, who aside from emceeing and producing has tried his hand at music video editing and directing, has learned, adapted and shined through with the tools that the experienced emcee\/producer MF Doom has handed him. Their collaborative album, NehruvianDOOM, blends crafty lyrics from Nehru, eclectically made beats by Doom, and an optimistic tone from the two artists combined. Considering his youth and scant years in the industry, Bishop Nehru surprisingly has a very clear, confident perspective on life, an unclouded vision, and a maturity that surpasses his years. In the face of others' jealousy and envy, he lays out his philosophy with strength in his delivery. Although Bishop Nehru mentions having to adjust to a dog eat dog world on \"Caskets\" (MF Doom provides a rap verse on that song), he counters this stark tone with words of love on \"Mean The Most.\" Ultimately, NehruvianDOOM would not sound as unique as it does if not for MF Doom's multifaceted production skills. Doom layers light and heavy sounds on top of each other and characteristically inserts obscure sound bytes to reinforce the album's mission. Bishop Nehru embraces his youth for the time being, but he also proves to be a threatening contender to his emcee peers. The youthful smarts in Nehru's skillful lyrics plus Doom's very special beats make NehruvianDOOM a fresh, underground treat.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Ive been a Switchfoot fan ever since New Way to Be Human was released back in 1999. I can still remember the days of wearing a Switchfoot t-shirt to school and having hardly anyone recognize them. My wife even had a friend who made a bet that the band would never make it big because they were terrible. Shes still waiting on that $20 payment. Needless to say, Ive believed in this band for a long time and after 17 years I continue to do so, though my excitement has worn off a bit over the past few years. Where the Light Shines Through has a lot going for it, yet it also suffers some of the same problems that have plagued the groups previous records, leaving it in a difficult spot and leaving me with conflicted feelings.\n\nThe album starts off on a very positive note. Holy Water is a solid rocker, the kind of engaging anthem that the band has become known for and it grabs your attention immediately. Unfortunately Float really kills the momentum and takes the album into a left turn that feels unnatural. The song has grown on me over time but within the context of the album it feels forced; it should have been moved in the running order or saved for another project. Thankfully the albums title track and I Wont Let You Go keep things moving, with the latter being one of the albums best cuts. I have to give particular attention to If the House Burns Down Tonight, both lyrically and musically. It manages to be both catchy and intriguing, driving at a restless pace while looking at the differences between possessions and relationships. The Day That I Found God is equally beautiful. The first half of this album fares quite well and offers us a number of wonderful moments.\n\nThe second half feels patchier. Bull in a China Shop and Healer of Souls both fail to leave much of an impression even after numerous listens. Shake This Feeling and Live It Well feel a bit generic but work well enough for what they are. Looking for America is the weakest cut on this LP, a fact that the normally talented Lecrae cant save. It feels like what it is: a couple of artists complaining about America without offering any real solutions beyond surface level catchphrases. Sure, America is in trouble, but couldn't the band at least turn that into something more inspiring than the typical feel guilty because of the nations past rhetoric thats been far too prevalent over the past few years? I used to think Switchfoot was above that sort of thing but here they sound woefully out of their depth. Thankfully Hope Is the Anthem ends the album with a bang and continues the bands tradition of exhilarating closers.\n\nWhere the Light Shines Through is a bit inconsistent but musically it feels lively and diverse, with enough variety that even the pickiest of listeners should walk away satisfied. What holds the album back (at least for me) is the lyrics, which have been a problem for several records now. Jon Foreman knows how to write deep and convicting lyrics, as evidenced by tunes like The Economy of Mercy, The Shadow Proves the Sunshine and Company Car. That was one of the elements that drew me to the band initially and there are times when I still catch glimpses of it. The problem is that Jon rests on the same topics of love, hope, belonging, materialism, inner turmoil and rising up. Normally those topics are fine and even inspiring but by now I just feel that Jon has exhausted those subjects and used every variation imaginable to say essentially the same thing. Too often it feels like a line of generic catchphrases and muddy solutions, neither of which moves me on a deeper level. Love and hope are wonderful things but there are ways to branch out and present them from a fresh perspective. I just want the lyrics to be as interesting and diverse as the music. Tracks like If the House Burns Down Tonight prove they can still do it and it would be great to see more like it.\n\nI apologize for a longer than normal review but I think Switchfoot is one of the best and most talented bands weve had in the past 20 years. Its out of love and care that I point out when the band isn't working because I want them to be the best they can be. Where the Light Shines Through is excellent in many respects---but the clich lyrics and uneven pacing hold it back from being truly great. My wife and I will be seeing them in September and it will no doubt be a marvelous experience. Id just like to see them push their lyrics and solutions as far as the music allows.","classification":4,"fold":2}

The first song sounds like a Tailored Swifter homage complete with auto-tune and vocal augmentation. If Zac does it in concert, expect a wrecking ball and a light footed dance troupe......pretty horrid. After that, it's quite a mixed bag of Buffett island tunes and Broadway belters. But, overall, it's worth purchase and it is a  fun listen.......just shake off the first TayTay dance fest.

{"text":"History recognizes him as one of the most influential and distinctive male voices of the early R&B vocal era. In fact, the legendary R&B group The Drifters had been formed in 1953 to showcase the vocal prowess of lead singer Clyde McPhatter. In late 1954 McPhatter was inducted into the Army and assigned to Special Services in the continental United States, which allowed him to continue recording with The Drifters. However, when he was discharged in 1956 he left the group to pursue a solo career. Over the next few years he would record a number of outstanding sides for Atlantic records. His biggest hit during this period was released in late 1958. \"A Lover's Question\" was a tune written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams. The song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts and spent a week atop the R&B chart. The song continues to be very popular among oldies buffs.","classification":5,"fold":2}

In later years I learned it was sort of a rock-version ripoff of a classic African folk tone, which of course makes sense. No matter, though, because being a universal language, music belongs to the world. There is so much going on in this arrangement, and it all fits together so perfectly, that you have to listen to it over and over to begin to pick up everything that's going, from the harmonies and little vocal touches and phrasings, to that incredible female background soprano, which I sounds almost like a Theramin, one of the first electronic instruments.

Coltrane, Shepp, Taylor, The Black Panthers, protest vs. revolution. All this had taken over jazz that year. So Charles Lloyd comes along, and Forest Flower says--\"This is all supposed to be fun. Chill for a second. We'll make the demonstration tomorrow. Let's play some tunes. RELAX!\"\n\nNot that these \"tunes\" leave subtance lacking. Lloyds sense of harmony and melody is increadible. Listening to is chord structres, I feel as if a Beatles or Brian Wilson has been channeled into a jazz man. His chords are so tuneful, this music is just a joy to listen to. Fresh and clean now as it was the day it was born.\n\nI don't have to tell you about the skill of Keith Jarret or Jack Dejonette--there is a reason Miles inducted them--and proof is right here.\n\nThere was a lot of great jazz like this during this era, and unfortunately, it gets hidden in the shadow of giants like Coltrane, Miles, and Archie Shepp. Listen to them always, but dig on this sometimes, too.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"IL VOLO ('The Flight') is a rather astonishingly gifted trio of teenagers who hit the big time in May of 2009 at an Italian television talent show and now are being guided by Geffen Records to world acclaim. Gianluca Ginoble was born on February 11, 1995 in Roseto degli Abruzzi (province of Teramo), in the Abruzzo region of central Italy; Ignazio Boschetto was born on October 4, 1994 in Agrigento (Sicily), while Piero Barone was born in Sicily on June 24, 1993, but grew up in Bologna (northern Italy). They sing from the heart but with voices that suggest operatic possibilities, IF they are coached and guided at the right pace.  With their current PR and bookings we can only hope that they don't destroy their natural talent by abusing their vocal cords and their egos.  As Geffen Chairman Ron Fair puts it 'Mario Lanza was one of the biggest matinee idols. He was like Elvis, yet singing legit operatic pop. The dark, handsome Italian guy is an iconic part of American culture. And well, here's three.'\n\nThere are other groups not dissimilar from Il Volo:  Il Divo is a group of four male singers: Spanish baritone Carlos Marn, Swiss tenor Urs Bhler, American tenor David Miller, and French pop singer Sbastien Izambard. To date, they have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide.  And there are individual singers who cross between ballads and opera such as Andrea Bocelli.  But they all started later in life.  The incredible aspect of these three youngsters who don't even appear to be shaving yet is the natural, unforced crooning they produce - crooning is more like serenading a loved one on a balcony than it is a spotlight on a huge arena.  But the boys are sticking for now to favorite Italian songs and some more popular songs from the stage.  Hearing them in person, on a stage, without the benefit of close miking would give us a better idea of the depth of talent that is obviously here.\n\nThis album was recorded in Los Angeles, Rome and London, gathering some powerful 'backers' along the way.  There is no doubt that what we hear on this recording is beautiful vocalization and interpretation of songs that lean toward serious but are aimed at the hearts of heir audiences.  It will be interesting to see how their careers develop, both as a group and individually.  For now we can just sit back and enjoy the beauty of their singing - and hope that they have engaged wise coaches to make sure they don't burn out too soon.

That is even more so with those in the public who are accustomed to people wanting them for what they have. Ne-Yo shows that he wants to be appreciated for who he is more than anything else.

After the dissapointing albums Brave and Rebirth, she needed to hit on the nail on the head with returning back into the mainstream. Sadly a few years ago, that didn't happen well when she failed with Loubotons and the poor Frsh Out The Oven, and a bad performance with her falling on her behind at the 2009 American Music Awards. It has been nearly 2 years since she made her plans with the long-awaited Love?. With also a shift of labels, being dropped from Sony and moving to Island Def Jam, she needed to make a new splash musically to work. That was a minor splash with On The Floor, and a weak follow-up with I'm Into You, the second single from the long-awaited Love? The song is a tried and not so true attempt to get back to square one musically to the way she was as a entertainer. I really wasn't feeling the song at all. It really was not anything that felt organic to what she should've been able to do. Hopefully, Jennifer will keep trying to do better as a judge on American Idol.

{"text":"With each new album, Panic! at the Disco has managed to progress their sound in interesting directions, and I've found myself enchanted by all of them.  Where some works have a fairly clear pattern--\"Pretty. Odd\" was a Beatles-esque feel from end to end--I'd have to say \"Death of a Bachelor\" is all over the map.  We have knockout pop hooks like \"Victorious\", an off-the-rails song of excess (\"Don't Threaten Me With a Good Time\") accented brilliantly with B-52s riffs, and the wild Swing sounds of \"Crazy=Genius\" just to name a few...but more to the point, it seems like with every album, lead singer Brendan Urie is determined to stretch himself vocally.  \"Emperor's New Groove\" hits some shocking high notes--then goes higher--\"Golden Days\" is belted out with intensity, and then we have two numbers that may not resonate with everyone, but are stylistically perfect:  the title song \"Death of a Bachelor\" and \"Impossible Year\" are crooned out Lounge-style, emulating Sinatra.  In between the extremes are some fairly familiar sounds, with \"Hallelujah\" and \"The Good, The Bad, and the Dirty\" comfortably sticking to Panic! at the Disco's core sound, and the smooth harmonies (and burgeoning cynicism) of \"LA Devotee\" also right at home.\n\nIf you're already a fan of \"Panic! at the Disco\" think of this as having some of the lyrical darkness of \"Vices & Virtues\", the tongue-in-cheek whimsy of \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\", and infectious vocals of \"Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!\".  \"Death of a Bachelor\" is an excellent new entry in Panic! at the Disco's Catalogue, and I can't wait to see where they go from here.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Recorded live\n  at The Fillmore East in 1970 and then released in 1973 to time-honoured success,\n  History Of The Grateful Dead, Volume 1 (Bears Choice) showcases its dedication\n  to Ron Pigpen McKernan, the bands keyboardist and harmonica player, who had\n  died from a liver disease that same year, was also a blues aficionado.  Featuring a\n  lively set of mostly country blues and a dash of rock and roll, the track set begin on\n  their take on Lightnin Hopkins Katie Mae as it concludes with other sincere tracks\n  like Dark Hollow, Ive Been Around This World, there elaborate take on The Everly\n  Brothers Wake Up Little Susie, Black Peter (from The Workingmans Dead), there\n  18-minute reindition of Howlin Wolfs signature classic Smokestack Lightning until\n  ending on a delightful note with the Otis Redding song Hard To Handle.  Produced\n  by Owsley Stanley, the underground chemist who became The Deads sound man\n  whom the band referred to as The Bear, you will truly find History Of The Grateful\n  Dead to be a refreshing and heartfelt dedication to the bands co-founder, but very\n  gifted band member, one that will remain as fresh and vibrant as ever.","classification":5,"fold":2}

She comes from a little corner of North Carolina, and if Mayberry actually existed, you wouldn't have difficulty imagining that her home must be just up the road a spell from Andy and Barney.\n\nI recently had my first exposure to the Sirius radio network, and tracks from this \"Flat-Out Funny\" recording were prominently rotated between Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy.  It is no faint praise to say that Jeanne Robertson is as funny as any of them.\n\nHer stories are full of wry and hilarious insights into the human condition, and it appears that any obstacle in her life simply becomes \"new material\".  This also seems to mean that anyone in her life is \"fair game\" for inclusion in her routines.  We hear many details about her husband, Jerry \"Leftbrain\", including his hesitation to accompany her on a near-disastrous eight-day rafting trip through the grand canyon, which included recreational opportunities such as hanging precariously from the side of a cliff, using AARP-vintage hands that at home would have difficulty opening a jar in the kitchen.\n\nThis recording is an absolute obvious choice for that person or family or group who wants to hear \"flat-out funny\" comedy that is suitable for all ears, but the truth is that she is also as funny as the comedians who use the full spectrum of language.\n\nFlat-Out recommended.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Trivium are among the shining stars of newer metal outfits - i.e., those who were infants when Metallica's \"Master Of Puppets\" was released.  So rather than slag the band for their obvious homage to a band that was, at one time, the best metal band out there, one can understand how influence works.  After all, this reviewer, who is the crusty old age of 47 now (AIIEEEEEEE) was a teenager when KISS was on top of the heap and Zeppelin still had three more albums to release before their first breakup.  The influence these bands had on guitarists my age is incalculable and unavoidable.  For example, while I love Eddie Van Halen's searing work on the first five VH albums, one may hear more of a Frehley or Hendrix influence in my playing, ala the blues and more melodic soloing.  For the record, I saw Metallica open for Raven in a dingy bar across the Arkansas River from Fort Smith on their first U.S. club tour.  We had no idea who they were, or that they even had a record out, which at that time was \"Kill 'Em All\" on Megaforce, with \"Ride The Lightning\" soon to follow.  We thought at the time they were a good blend of punk ferocity and metal chops, which I still think is accurate to this day when we discuss \"Kill 'Em All.\"\n  Which brings us to Trivium, who could easily be my own kids.  I gave \"Ascendency\" a good review on these pages, but I deferred the fifth star because of the uneven vocal approach - gutteral roaring and mewing harmony backgrounds.  \"The Crusade\" is the result of a band that truly is heads above most of their peers, both skill-wise and intelligence-wise.  The vocals are eerily similiar to a young James Hetfield, but most of the album has gruff harmonies throughout and the best part, no grunting.\n  I hear some similarities musically to their mentors, but Trivium have a great thrash style of their own that has a tad of progressivism that Metallica didn't.  It isn't much, and that's good because I hate progrock, but also gives them the needed twist to keep them from being relegated to a copy band status.\n  \"The Crusade\" rocks mightily, the guitar work is astounding, and I really like the title instrumental track that showcases their chops.  I expect great things from this band, and hope they don't succumb to the drek Metallica came out with after \"And Justice For All\", which, for a major album, is the worst sounding CD in metal history.","classification":5,"fold":2}

In fact, Tre! limps along from the beginning without finding its footing or establishing a departure from the first 2 installments. This is a really boring disc with little distinguishing features. Perhaps the brightest spot comes from \"Dirty Rotten B******\", which returns them to the epic song format they've advanced since \"Jesus of Suburbia\". Altogether, they sound like they've exhausted themselves here. This is easily the weakest of the bunch. From here, I suppose I'll begin assembling the best tracks from the 3 albums into my own setlist.

{"text":"Like most people, I discovered this song while watching the show Code Monkeys. After I'd seen that whole show, I got a little interested in the song, and looked it up. Even though I loved the show, I can tell you that Jonathan Coulton's song has now become the much more important to me.\n\nI love it for a couple of reasons. First, it is a tremendously catchy song. It's well played and sung, with a great pop-rock chorus.\n\nSecond, it's actually sort of a meaningful song, at least to me. I'm not literally a code monkey, but there's not doubt that I'm a nerd, the proverbial nice-guy who comes in last and can't get the pretty receptionist to pay any attention to me, who works hard in a job that's boring and unappreciated. Goodness, I even like to drink Tab and eat Fritos. I'm not the only person like this. So, I just love it for being a good song acknowledging my experience of the world, while being funny and hopeful, too. It's a great song that I've found myself passing along to my nerd friends who love it, too.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"One of the best Simon and Garfunkel songs is sound of silence. It's not often covered partly I suspect as it was about as good as it could be in the original version and partly because of the range and power of Art Garfunkel's vocals. I'm not familiar with the band disturbed but this version of Sounds of Silence is an epic rework of a folk classic. Structurally it is similar to the original but David Draiman's voice adds a darkness and menace to the lyrics which enhances the dark theme inherent in the lyrics. This is simply one of the best modern rock songs.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Crows combine the best of  the iconic groups\/ musicians- the Band , Van Morrison with a touch of the country rock period of the Byrds and also a dash of poppy Big Star in a couple of albums. I don't think they are capable of making  bad or average albums. Even their interpretation of  cover songs like Annie, Meet on Ledge , Mercy etc . sound at par or better than originals. Their brand of folk rock combines the excellent voice of the lead singer with hard edged guitar sound\n IMO, they occupy top place in the present melodic folk rock world consisting of bands like Jayhawks, Decemberists, Ryan Adams, Wilco etc .

I remember some of my friends and I before school would start walk the halls singing this song. I mean you do crazy things when your 12\/13 years old. The reason why I like this song , I guess it's because its not like other glam band songs, this one sounds different.

Yes, the singer does sound like Bono at times and they have certainly learned a few things from Radiohead and, perhaps, Wilco. None the less they are all very competent musicians in their own right and they do have a very distinct sound. I am a music geek, so the two videos (one a half-hour long) of their creative process in the studio are fascinating to  me. I loved this so much, that I also bought several of their most recent works. They  have an affinity for mixing time signatures, unique blending of instruments and creating very meditative moments.

{"text":"When you are in love, you can feel this song 5 fold. If you're not in love, but a dreamer like me, then you aren't left out.\n\nAlicia picked a good single. Making it her first, to me, at first wasn't the smartest because this was not the song that impacted me on the first listen. The keyboard (or organ) in it is fantastic but it just wasn't what we were used to with her...it was really different. And the video was kinda too.\n\nBut the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with the song! Her voice was (and still is!) very, very heartfelt. It starts out with your basic piano arrangement; pretty; lulling; uncomplicated. Then comes in the \"organ\" and it's nice; fitting. But you continue on, hear the chorus twice, and then the beautiful bridge comes in, and once you've heard it about 5x, you sing along;\n\n\"I know-ow....some people search the world...\" \"To fi-ind...somethin' like what we H A A A A V E.\" \"I know-ow...people will try...try to define...somethin' so R E E A L. So till the end of time...I'm tellin' you that...No one...\"\n\nAnd that's the part that grips you, and makes you continue to sing it, along with Alicia...\n\nGreat tune. Will get stuck in your head after a few listens.\n\n4.5 stars.\n\nEnd Note: Great tune. Might have to sink in after repeated listens.

{"text":"Years ago, when I was listening to K-LOVE a lot I heard Kari Jobe and immediately loved her music. At the time, the song \"Steady My Heart\" from her album \"Where I Find You\" was the newest single and I couldn't stop listening to it! I was going through some tough times and that song always helped soothe me. The last few years I've been busy raising my twins so I haven't consistently listened to music and only recently have I started listening to more music. I love to sing and listening to music that I both love and that's easy to sing along with is perfect for me because I always feel more relaxed, uplifted and happier afterwards. For the last several weeks, I've been listening to Kari Jobe's music nonstop because she is one of my favorite Christian artists and her music is beautiful. I'm very grateful to Amazon Prime for allowing me to listen to this album!\n\n\"Kari Jobe\" is Jobe's debut album and it is absolutely wonderful! There are 12 songs and the album lasts about 54 minutes in length. The product description states this album is considered Christian Contemporary and I agree with that because all of the songs are filled with praising God with a contemporary feel, using many musical instruments. Every song is so full of meaning and I can't help but sing along. I enjoy every song but would say my favorites are \"Healer\" (I could listen to this song over and over!), \"Beautiful,\" \"Singing Over Me,\" \"Sweep Me Away,\" and \"Revelation Song,\" the latter of which has been sung by many artists.\n\nI LOVE this album, along with the album \"Where I Find You\" and I am eager for her newest album \"The Garden\" to come out soon! I've been listening to her music for several hours a day and it fills me with such joy and peacefulness. I love listening to her beautiful voice and find myself singing along with her at times. The other reason I love her music so much, and most Christian music, is that it's safe for my four-year-old twins to listen to and I don't have to worry about them hearing anything they shouldn't. If you enjoy any of Kari Jobe's music, I highly recommend this album!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the \"Riddles In The Sand\" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on \"Mango\".  \"Please Bypass This Heart\" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with \"If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me\".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include \"Frank And Lola\" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  \"Desperation Samba\" is another great Buffett \"south of the border\" tune.  The title track \"Last Mango In Paris\" is classic Buffett.  The album closer \"Beyond The End\" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites \"Jolly Mon\" and \"Gypsies In The Palace\".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"My God, how can Lucinda Williams just get better and better? This may be her best release ever, certainly since \"Essence,\" or \"World Without Tears.\" This is a double disc, an always risky undertaking, but I found myself wanting even more. I have listened to this many, many times over and I can't find a \"weak\" track. Even though a quick listen could lead one to believe that this is a \"mellow\" album. But then there are the lyrics and song titles.\nLucinda begins this effort with, \"Dust\", which may be the most powerful song of disgust and disenchantment with a lover. \"Even your tears are dust,\" she sings. Wow! A simple sentence that puts a dagger in the heart of the object of her disdain. Another example where just the title tells you she is not making a \"happy-go-lucky\" type of album is the morbid\/gruesome \"If My Love Could Kill.\" The title says it all.\nAs I said, there is not a weak track on here. But make no mistake, this is Lucinda at her taciturn, low key, down in the blues best. She sings the words in a manner that may seem laconic, but there is no doubt she means every sharp cutting word and phrase. This album may well stand as one of her best and most memorable efforts.\nHer lyrics make it clear that she is a woman who has seen it all, survived it all, been knocked down and gotten back up, as witnessed by the closing track on disc two, \"Faith and Grace.\"\nA word has to be said about the musicians and the arrangements which combine to create a mood that makes it seem that the lights were out in the studio, and that no matter how many lights are on when you listen to this gorgeous set, the room seems to darken. I have listened to it in my room with only moonlight and reflected streetlights for illumination, and that seemed just right. I want to mention along these same lines that the economic but perfectly placed use of dissonance is true artistry.\nThis album represents one of those times when an artist and her band are just in their own world and just killing it. I could not recommend \"The Ghosts of Highway 20\" any more highly. It is a must have, and is in the running for my best album of the year.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"From their more punk roots of their early years, to the heralded \"From Under The Cork Tree,\" to their fan polarizing follow-up. With their 3rd major-label rocker, the band named after an obscure Simpsons character returns to tweak their sound just a bit. Whether they'll succeed remains to be seen, but I'm just glad the song titles are shorter. The first single \"I Don't Care\" is the first single off the album, and let me tell you, the kids are loving it.\n\nThe lyrics are an apathetic ubber-ego emo-fest that is built upon a cleaver chorus of, \"I don't care what you think, as long as it's about me!\" It's played up in the usual Fall Out Boy power-rock\/ anthemic arena rock fashion, and I would say it's certainly their best rock song since \"Cork Tree.\"\n\nSo, if you're a Fall Out Boy fan, an apathetic emo teen, or an arena power rocker, then this song is for you. It's not polarizing, it's mainstream, and Pete Wentz still knows how to crank out the hits. Amazingly, this isn't even one of the better tracks on the album.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Her earlier work, including hits \"I'm Like a Bird\" and \"Powerless\" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n  2006 saw the debut of her song \"Promiscuous\", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take \"Promiscuous\" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Its not until she has a hot single out that people remember that Monica is one of the best. Ever since she debut on the scene when she was 14, we knew something was special. Not to many artist can match her vocally. Keyshia Cole, Keri Hilson & Fantasia all need to be giving praise to the woman who paved the way for their style. Now Monica is back again with maybe her best album \"Still Standing\".\n\nMonica has put together a very solid album. This CD is definitely about life after breakups. The intro track \"Still Standing\" ft. Ludacris is banging. \"One In A Lifetime\" is a good slow groove track. By know everyone has heard the hit single \"Everything To Me\". (Which I thought was a remake of Minnie Riperton when I first heard it) Other standouts are \"Stay Or Go\", \"Here I Am\" and the gem \"Love All Over Me\". Now things go wrong with the Missy Elliott-assisted \"If You Were My Man\". But it doesn't spoil the mood of the album. And the album is way too short with only 10 songs.\n\nHas the female R&B game become oversaturated? I can't remember a time when so many female artist were hot at the same time. Now you have to throw Monica's name back in the mix. She's been through this before. She survived the Brandy years. She survived the Mary J. Blige years. She survived the Lauryn Hill days. And she will no doubt survive this era.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"It has been awhile since Mariah Carey has came out with a good song. Her last album Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel was an absolute disgrace and her last song Triumphant was a absolutely degrading song. Her last time she had made a song for the movie, she made it for the failed Glitter soundtrack, with Never Too Far and the lackluster Loverboy. But for her latest single, Almost Home from the upcoming Oz, The Great & Powerful is a bit better than her other movie songs, and her last singles that failed to drive. Her personal life the past several years has taken more of a mixed bag with losses, both with Michael Jackson and the definitive Whitney Houston, and newfound joy with the birth of her twins with Nick Cannon. This song though takes Mariah musically a turn into the right direction. The song is definitely better than the wasted tracks from the past years like Obsessed and her lacklsuter cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is. This song though is one of her better tracks in awhile, and definitely something to check out.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" and \"In Utero\" are THE definitive grunge albums, and it really shows. Kurt Cobaine's voice perfectly suits the musical style, and gives each song an edge that other bands would kill for. Every song here is great (though some are \"better\" than others, and \"Polly\" and \"Something In The Way\" are arguably the weakest), and there are even four grunge classics here (\"Smells Like Team Spirit\", \"In Bloom\", \"Come As You Are\" and \"Lithium\"). Lyrically all the songs are interesting to listen to, albeit pretty depressing some of the time. Musically this is just a fantastic album - it's on par with Beatles and Dylan albums in terms of its influence on the music industry. The production is great and the musicianship is pretty much perfect. \"Nevermind\" essentially popularized the genre while \"In Utero\" introduced it to the world. Most people will really like these two albums. If you like this album I also highly recommend the Goo Goo Dolls' \"A Boy Named Goo\".

{"text":"Deep Still Blue is a multi-media presentation containing a CD plus a DVD of breathtaking underwater photography set to music. This is the ninth release from the husband and wife duo of Pamela and Randy Copus, known as 2002, whose signature sound includes \"romantic themes, opulent string arrangements, piano, acoustic guitar, harp, flute, and lush vocal textures.\" The underwater photographs by Susan Saibara are some of the most amazing I've seen.\n\nThen, of course, there is the music - equally exquisite in its aquatic ambience that pervades the recording. Randy and Pamela go to great lengths to create \"celestial choirs\" by layering many tracks of their voices, sometimes evoking an \"Enya-like feel,\" although in the inimitable style of 2002. This quality is particularly evident on the first track \"Where the Stars and Moon Play.\" The vocal element recedes into the background a bit on the next song \"When I See You Again,\" leaving space for lovely liquid guitar lines by Randy. I appreciate in his playing an understated elegance that always compliments the piece perfectly. This is followed by the title track that has an ethereal yet epic quality featuring Pamela's melodious flute work - first soloing over the background, then in unison with the \"choir.\" These are but a few of the many instruments these multi-talented artists perform on.\n\nThe 2-disc set comes with a gorgeous full-color 13-page booklet that features photos from the DVD as well as print versions of the song's lyrics, credits, and other information. In addition to the lush music and imagery on the DVD, bonus features include an interview with 2002, as well as one with photographer Susan Saibara. Having the booklet and the DVD with these interviews adds so much to fully experiencing the music, especially at a time when the trend is towards downloading mp3's of single songs. Deep Still Blue is so much more than just a CD - it is a holistic experience that immerses you in the world of 2002 for a few hours from which you emerge both enchanted and expanded. It's also one that you'll be happy to dive into again and again.\n\nFor a full-length version of this review, please visit:","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Germanys power metal army is anchored  in my opinion  by the veteran triad of Helloween, Blind Guardian and Accept. Despite age, line-up changes and a morphing metal world these bands have carried the torch for decades. But every great army needs a savvy and aggressive cavalry filled with younger soldiers who are the eyes and ears of the greater force. Enter Primal Fear. No, they haven't been around as long as those progenitors of the scene, but Scheepers and company have proven that they possess the conviction and skill to not only spar with the best of them, but to carry the battle onward once the veteran forces retire. For the past few years they have been delivering the metal with an increased fervor  their last two albums (Unbreakable and Delivering The Black) right up there with some of the best power metal the world has to offer. And despite the departure of drummer Randy Black, they have not lost any momentum in the rolling out of Rulebreaker, an album which shares much in common with its stellar predecessor. The dynamic duo of Sinner and Hansen has perfected the art of producing\/recording classic metal as these songs have plenty of punch, crunch and shred.\n\nFor me, Scheepers remains one of the top 5 metal singers out there right now  his vocal style absolutely perfect for this metal. Beyrodt, Naumann and Karlsson drive the leads while Sinner anchors this wall of guitars with his staunch bass. Francesco Jovino rounds out the 6 man ensemble  his drumming perfectly complimenting the bands Priest meets Accept style rhythm approach. Songwise, its all good, and its all metal but the highlights for me this time around would definitely be In Metal We Trust (the perfect metal anthem!), Rulebreaker and the absolutely killer epic track We Walk Without Fear, which reminds me a lot of One Night In December but even better, even more passionate and brutal. Consistently great, the Fear have once again delivered the metal with pace, power and pride.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The \"blue-eyed soul\" vocal duo known as The Righteous Brothers had experienced some moderate chart success in the early 1960's when they caught the eye of Phil Spector. He signed Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield to his Philles label in the autumn of 1964 and immediately set about to create a new and distinctive sound for the boys. Their debut single on Philles was \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin\" and it shot right to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in early 1965. Over the next year Spector would produce three more Top Ten hits for The Righteous Brothers before the duo decided to leave Philles and signed a new record deal with Verve. That may have been a mistake because Phil Spector obviously knew what he was doing and despite a #1 song \"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration\" The Righteous Brothers were never able to attain the same level of success at their new record label that they had at Philles. \"Lovin Feelin\" has been recognized by both the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of the most important songs in the history of rock & roll.  One of the greatest singles of the decade.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Muse burst on the scene with 1999's \"Showbiz\" which recalled Radiohead with a dash of the theatrics of Queen. Since then, the UK indie rockets have been pretty consistent. Album number seven, \"Drones\", is a concept album of sorts; mankind enslaved by technology and mind control, emphasised by a pair of foreboding interludes (\"Drill Sergeant\" and \"(JFK)\"). The sound ranges from hard rock to electro to operatic.\n\n\"Dead Inside\" opens the album, a punchy dance rocker with electronic flourishes. \"Psycho\" is glam rock with shades of Depeche Mode and a stadium-friendly chorus. Pile-driving beats, swirling synths and shredded guitars rule on songs like the racing \"Reapers\", \"The Handler\", or \"Defector\", with Matt Bellamy's forlorn yelp managing to rise above the cacophony, alternating between gently melodic to brute noise.\n\nThe aptly titled \"Aftermath\" shifts the tempo down, a soothing balm after the prior pummelling with the band unleashing their inner U2 on a song that recalls \"One\". Elegiac and beautiful with an enchanting trilling guitar solo.\n\nThe album's revelation though is the ten minute-long \"The Globalist\" which starts with some Morricone-style whistling, a slowly unfurling guitar intro, bursts of blistering guitar, piano balladry with the tempo shifting from gentle to skyscraping melodrama, a rock symphony.\n\nClosing is the hymnal title track with lyrics about getting killed by drones, if one can get through the warbled choir. A fitting finale after all the paranoia and claustrophobia.","classification":4,"fold":2}

However, the music up to that point is rather reminiscent of the annoying synthetic sounds so often found in video games twenty years ago.  In small quantities that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's the sort of thing one has to be in the mood for.  As for the lyrics, Friedberger seems to be telling the story of getting into a car accident while mulling over her frustrations with an ex-lover, but it doesn't really make much sense and it's hard to tell what exactly is going on.  During the verses, the words seem to spill from her mouth in a jumbled torrent.  What does \"tube top and shorts with thighs cut, hold me down\" mean, exactly?  How about \"he's ignoring me like it's 2001\"?\n\nIt's not a bad song, and its better moments have me thoroughly convinced of Friedberger's potential, but it has too many rough edges and irritating qualities to be as enjoyable as it might otherwise have been.","classification":3,"fold":2}

For Lifehouse the sophomore release Stanley Climbfall establishes the group as one of the most prolific of this age.  Coming off a multi platinum cde and the most played single so far this millenium, you might expect a let down.  But Lifehouse has taken things to a new level, a place that doesn't settle for the shallowness and mediocrity of modern music. Every song 1 - 14 is as good as a song can get.

{"text":"Elton John is a musical genius who has cranked out hit after hit over the years and even manged to receive knighthood from the British Queen. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, the namesake cut from its album, is not only a fine tune in its own right but is one of the best hits to come out of the 1970s. Many critics consider this gold blockbuster to be Elton John's finest song. It is an amazing song but in my opinion, Elton John did a number of hits equally as good. Nevertheless, this is an essential hit sung in ballad form.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Tantric's sophomore effort is pure brilliance.  After hearing seeing them live, I immediately went out and bought their self-titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch, fantastic rock music.  So when I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic.  Though this album is a little more 'hard' then their first CD, it's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there.  Their first single 'Hey Now' is actually more like their old stuff.  My favourite song on the CD would have to be 'Hero', a brilliant done song.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac remake, the beginning doesn't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus, you can hear their signature sound.  From start to finish this album delivers and I cannot WAIT to hear more.  If you liked the first album from Days of the New, Tantric's first CD or just love rock music you won't be disappointed with this.\n\nThat was my review after the first week of having the CD, now I have a little more to say.  Tantric's 'After We Go' is a timeless album, it hasn't left my CD player since it's release.  It's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more.  Each track is amazingly good, it's like a big juicy apple pie, rich and delicious.  The opener, 'Chasing After' is a fast paced starter, Hugo's vocals are extremely well done here, lyrically good as well.  'After We Go' is one of my favourites (tied with about 5 others), the background vocals surpass Hugo's...strange, no.  The talent of this band is overflowing.  'Falling Away' is musically, one of the best songs I've heard.  The guitar work is actually intelligent.  The first single 'Hey Now' is a single I actually love to listen to.  'Hero' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit, it's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem, if that is an apology, I accept.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac cover, very well done of the classic, the chorus is hard edged, I love Hugo's vocals on the 'and if you don't love me now, you will never love me again', chills.  'Change The World' is a great song to start off if you're a new Tantric fan, it's not as experimental, still extremely well done.  'Just Once' is my favourite song, I think when I listen to it, I go into a different world, the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up.  These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme, the best damn music I've ever heard in a long time!  All of these are tied with 'After We Go' for my favourite after 'Just Once' - that didn't really make sense.  In any case, 'Relentless' is lyrically amazing, Hugo's vocals are sexy as hell.  'Alright' - what can I say, the chorus ... if you're a woman, you will get caught up in the vocals, I am telling you, there is nothing sexier than Hugo's vocals.  Todd - you are a god.  Always will be.  'Before' really, there isn't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it's brilliance.  Lastly, 'Awake', a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more.  I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album!!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"There is no question that when it has came down to music, Elton John has honestly been one of the most universal and strong entertainers, not just in his music, but how relevant he stays with younger people. But back in the 80's, when the industry was starting to second guess Elton, he had some songs that were away from what he did best with Bernie Taupin, that showed well in some tracks like Mama Can't Buy Me Love and Blue Eyes. Blue Eyes which he wrote with Gary Osbourne is one of those forgotten gems of Elton's that definitely is a pleasure to listen to. It is a simplistic song that shows Elton's character at heart well in songs. While many people don't look or listen to it as is the case with I'm Still Standing and I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, it still is one song absolutely worth checking out, young and old Elton John fans alike.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"It isn't!\n\nHow funny is this, I downloaded this a few days before it was offered in the 25 Days Of Free thinking it seemed very odd for Lady GaGa to be doing \"O Christmas Tree\" but I also downloaded a bunch of other stuff at the same time that I was in a bigger hurry to listen to.  Then I got so wrapped up in protesting the listing of \"Slower Than Christmas\" that I didn't even take the time to look at the reviews this song was getting until today's offering of Badd Santa \"Christmas Girl\".  I hadn't even listened to it until today.  Surprise surprise, it isn't \"O Christmas Tree\" after all, but a song that makes sexual metaphors out of Christmas trees (and female metaphors at that, figure that one out).\n\nSetting the gross inappropriateness of this song aside for a moment, this is a weak song musically.  If I'm not mistaken, there are two lines in the entire song, maybe three.  It makes a strange shift in the middle to Space Cowboy rapping the same line, then shifts back to GaGa, and then finishes with one of my big pet peeves, a self reference (and a double one at that)!  The backing music is a choppy, repetitive bed of electronic harmony which has nothing exciting to offer.  The only thing this song brings to the table is overt sexuality.  Coming from a former burlesque dancer, this seems no surprise.  That Amazon wants to advertise it as part of the 25 Days Of Free would be surprising if it weren't a part of a disturbing trend this year.\n\nAmazon is trying very hard to push the \"edgy\" envelope and it is leaving a lot of us scratching our heads.  I think it would be more understandable if the edgy songs in question were particularly good, but they aren't.  This song brought to mind a song they sometimes play on Bob and Tom about Santa going to town, only that song is FUNNY, this isn't.\n\nThis song is blatantly irresponsible in that it is targeted at pop music buyers.  The age bracket for pop music buyers is 12(ish) to 25.  The upper range of that bracket I have no issue with, but this includes middle school kids.  Singing this kind of innuendo to middle schoolers is just plain wrong.  With the setup of getting this song off a Christmas recommendation list and an innocuous title that can easily be mistaken for an age old Christmas carol, I'm sure this will lead to many kids getting their hands on this right under their parents' unsuspecting noses.\n\nAMAZON PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION!!!\nYOU ARE GOING TO START LOSING CUSTOMERS IF YOU DON'T SHAPE UP YOUR ACT HERE!\nOne slip-up in the 25 day cycle could be forgiven, but three in a week is looking very deliberate and people are getting offended.  25 Days Of Free is looked at as a platform for holiday friendly, family friendly music.  A nice way to get some songs to add to the playlist when company is over.  Stop wasting slots on songs that the vast bulk of your customers are summarily deleting.  And for Pete's sake, READ THE REVIEWS PEOPLE ARE LEAVING!  Stop trying to pitch to the 5 to 10 people who like raunchy instead of the 100's that don't want it!","classification":1,"fold":2}

{"text":"Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.\n\nThe group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.\n\nThe disc starts off with the rock anthem \"What This World Needs.\"  Think \"If We are the Body\" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.\n\nThe title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, \"Somewhere in the Middle.\"  In fact, the phrase \"between the altar and the door\" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.\n\nAs with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with \"I Know You're There\" and \"All Because of Jesus,\" but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.\n\nMy two favorite songs are back to back.  \"Slow Fade\" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing \"Because Little Eyes.\"  It's enough to give me chills.\n\nAppropriately enough, the next song is \"East to West.\"  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.\n\nMusically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.","classification":5,"fold":2}

This is a very good album...just really interesting and exceptional musically.\n\nIf you're at all interested in this kind of music, you cannot go wrong with Mezzanine.\n\nEDIT: I've actually been listening to this album more over the last 24 hours and am now of the opinion that it's more masterful than I originally thought. It's easily listenable from start to finish. There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.\n\nAs others have alluded to, or stated, this is the kind of CD that holds a constant spot near the top of one's music collection.

{"text":"And the Winner IsDebussy\n\nThe online Facebook community voted in May and the winner of the first online Bach Guild poll was the Little Big Box of Debussy. This title has been on the books for a while, but recent additions of catalog to the Bach Guild have made this box bigger, and better.\n\nMuch of the Vanguard repertoire included on this boxed set is getting its digital debut with this release. In fact, the only Debussy to be widely available in digital form are the Preludes performed by Sviatoslav Richter on the Vanguard Richter in Paris LP release.\n\nDebussy might not have been well-represented in the Vanguard catalog, but we were still able to put together a diverse box that touches on Debussys most well-known works, mixed with some of his chamber works and songs.\n\nThe other fine development is the first inclusion of a new recording in The Bach Guild. Pianist Jeffrey Biegels recordings of beloved Debussy solo piano works makes its debut on this playlist.\n\nReturning from the depths of the Vanguard vaults is a recording from the marvelous Swiss tenor Hugues Cuenod and pianist Jacqueline Blancard, of Ariettes Oubliees and three other songs. Available only on LP and long, long out of print, this lovely performance even has a few snippets of studio talk  we couldn't edit everything out of the master tapes we had, as the chatty vocalist seemed determined to talk endlessly through the session.\n\nNot quite as long lost, but long out of print are the Houston Symphony Orchestras recordings of two of Debussys large orchestral works. La Mer and Nocturnes are heard here, and are available for the first time since the late 1980s. Omega, which followed Vanguard Classics, regained control of the Vanguard classical catalog and reissued many recordings, but oddly, these were not among them. So Vanguard issued CDs in the late 1980s, but Omega never made these recordings available on CD. So were happy to finally offer these performances, conducted by Sergiu Comissiona.\n\nThere are some lovely violin and piano performances by Jan Tomasow and Franz Holotschek, beautifully recorded, that are finally available digitally as well.\n\nSo voters, you asked for this marvelous box  enjoy this lush, gorgeous, romantic little box of Debussy.","classification":5,"fold":2}

The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.\n\nI'm just glad this was free.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"2009's VECKATIMEST is a fantastic album, and it ranks among one of the best albums recorded in the past ten years.  Grizzly Bear's second studio album is as finely crafted and poured over as anything available on the indie-rock market.  Maybe it's the album's attention to detail; maybe it's the sincerity the band expressed through the lyrics; maybe it's the melodies and soaring harmonies; whatever it is, VECKATIMEST is undoubtedly a hard album to follow up.  If you haven't heard the album yet, you really owe it to yourself to stop reading now and check out this previous album.  Aside from it being a completely refreshing listen, this album will inform much of the band's fourth full-length album SHIELDS.\n\nAfter touring for VECKATIMEST, Grizzly Bear took a 3-year hiatus from making music together to explore their own divergent musical tastes.  While SHIELDS is definitely a Grizzly Bear record, it uses a much more varied and scattered approach than the intricate VECKATIMEST.  There are moments on SHIELDS that reach out into unexplored territory for the band: psychedelic rock, atmospheric minimalism, and synthesizers.  If their previous album was a meticulous exercise in tightly-wound control, this album is a more instinctual and gritty affair.\n\nThe opening track, \"Sleeping Ute,\" makes no attempt to hide the band's less-polished features.  The guitar riff that carries the song is a bit jarring: using a non-standard time signature, it sounds good but feels disorienting.  The same frenetic acoustics of \"Southern Point\" appear on SHIELDS' second track, \"Speaking in Rounds.\"  Things take a turn for the poppier with \"Yet Again,\" and \"A Simple Answer;\" the latter song begins not unlike another well-crafted pop tune, but by the 4-minute mark, the song is completely ditched for a new direction.  The remaining two minutes of this song, after abandoning the pop-tune melody, the song changes considerably to a more downbeat, moody course.  Between these two songs, the minimalist \"The Hunt\" wouldn't sound out of place on a Radiohead record (particuarly on IN RAINBOWS); it's sparse instrumentation (and inclusion of clarinet?) make this song excellent.  The brief interlude \"Adelma\" is a subterranean and submerged atmospheric exercise - it's a completely unexpected moment on SHIELDS, and one that I wouldn't have predicted for Grizzly Bear.  The same eerie minimalism is repeated in the outro of the excellent \"What's Wrong.\"  There's a groove on \"gun-shy\" that Grizzly Bear haven't quite experimented with yet - it's a smoky and sexy tone, and it slowly comes together to form one of the more accessible tracks on the record.  The album ends with \"Sun in Your Eyes,\" a song that isn't scared to let a few notes of silence ring out -- these moments of silence aren't annoying or jarring, they come at just the right moment, making the song a wistful, quietly beautiful piece.  The ending, complete with harmonies, pounding organs, and distorted bass finds the band ripping loose for the album's finale.\n\nMake no mistake, SHIELDS is a great record, but it doesn't have the same \"mainstream appeal\" that VECKATIMEST had - there's no potential crossover hits like \"While You Wait for the Others\" or \"Two Weeks.\"  Instead, this album is chock full of great songs that work best in the cohesion of the album's entirety.  For this reason, this record might be a little less friendly to new listeners (not that that is necessarily a bad thing).  I would recommend listeners who have not listened to Grizzly Bear to start with their third album before moving onto this one: VECKATIMEST is a much more accessible and immediate album than SHIELDS, thanks to the support of the aforementioned singles and less scattered direction.\n\nWhat I like about all of this is that this album doesn't try to one-up the previous record.  Instead, the band tried to do something a bit different - much of what made VECKATIMEST great is represented here, but there's enough changed and tinkered with that this album is hard to draw complete comparisons to.  This album is a must-listen for fans of Grizzly Bear, and it's a more-than-worthy addition to a band with an extraordinary (but young) catalog.

{"text":"Detroit native Andwele Gardner has done a lot within the last ten years of his career. After his self-released album made the rounds, it landed in the hands of J Dilla- who invited him to sing on the cover of Donald Byrd's \"Think Twice\" from his 2001 album \"Welcome To Detroit\". From there, he made his first appearance on the radio on Slum Village's \"Tainted\". He started work on his major label debut and in 2003, \"Subject\" landed in stores. Anchored by the song about rekindling lost love \"Find A Way\", the song united him with DJ Quik's right hand man George \"G-One\" Archie. 2005 saw the release of his sophomore effort \"Some Kinda...\", where he got help from producer Mike City (Sunshine Anderson, Carl Thomas) on the first single \"I Think I Love U\". The next couple of years saw Dwele make a couple of notable appearances: Specifically on J Dilla's posthumous LP \"The Shining\" and the biggest guest spot of his career- singing the hook on Kanye West's \"Flashing Lights\" from his multi-platinum album \"Graduation\". For as much success Dwele had on the radio, his albums never quite got the push they needed at Virgin Records. So in 2008, he moved to Koch Records for the Dilla tribute \"Sketches Of A Man\". Two years later, he followed it up with the politically themed concept album \"W.ants W.orld W.omen\" and appeared on \"Power\"- the first single from Kanye West's \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\".\n\nIn 2012, Dwele released his fifth recording entitled \"Greater Than One\". On this album, it's pretty much business as usual for Dwele as he does what he does best. Unlike most of his albums, \"Greater Than One\" is rather short- even by Dwele's standards. He starts the album with the brief title track, the minute long \"Greater Than One Less Than Three\". On \"Going Leaving\", he tells the true story of a woman he lost who wanted to start a family despite him not being ready. He sings of dancing seductive on \"Takes 22 Tango\" and reunites with Raheem DeVaughn  on the duet \"What You Gotta Do\". He collaborates with producer Mike City yet again on the first single \"What Profit\" and \"Special\" as well as G-One on \"Love Triangle\". On the song \"Must Be\" he is joined by his artists J. Tait and L'Renee with rapper\/producer Black Milk on the only R&B song he appears on to date. He also reunites with fellow Detroit singer Monica Blaire on the song about sophisitcation \"Swank\". On \"PATrick RONald\", Dwele sings and raps about his refusal to share his expensive bottle of Patron. He closes the album with the mellow ballad \"Frankly My Dear (I'm Bennett I Ain't Innnit)\" in which he unknowingly gets involved with a married woman. Overall, Dwele's \"Greater Than One\" is another outstanding effort from the singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist. While he hasn't done anything ground breaking, he still made a great album that has become his trademark of melodic sounds and mellow vocals.","classification":5,"fold":2}

This original version is a lot better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Beyonc-eacute-Remix\/dp\/B0013EM6T0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Beyonc&eacute; Remix<\/a>.

{"text":"David Byrne has always been an important musical thinker as far as I'm concerned anyway. Always very strongly attuned to rhythms he was one of the few people of his era able to see the possibilities in the African concept of polyrhythms in music and finding new ways to expand on that. He not only did that as a founding member of Talking Heads but also through a couple decades of creatively groundbreaking solo recordings. Now there are a number of artists taking up his league such as Annie Clarke,better known as St. Vincent,who is in her way seeking to expand on the perceived foundations of \"pop\" music. So the two combined in 2010 to begin recording this project that would not only combine her songwriting with his rhythmic sensibilities,but also add to that an enormous brass section arranged by people like Lenny Pickett but also electronic beats from John Congleton. With all these cooks in the kitchen,would it be possible for the duo's talents to be able to express their musical points coherently. The results are more surprising than one might think.\n\n  One can dress it up any way they want,but the foundation of the music is here is still very much on funk. You can here that on songs such as the opening songs \"Who\",\"Weekend In The Dust\",\"Dinner For Two\",\"Ice Age\" and \"I Am An Ape\". Not only are Byrne and Clarke's musical outlooks both highly compatible but on these five numbers the groove is laid on thick for some uniquely produced funk\/pop epics. \"The Forest Awakes\" and \"I Should Watch TV\" showcase a more prominant Afro-latin rhythm. Nothing new for Byrne of course but the mixture of them with some of the orchestral horn arrangements and creative use of melody again creates a potent groove based set up. On the former song,in fact the influence of the Minneapolis\/Prince style use of the drum machine,prominent in hip-hop in years to come,is firmly in play. The only real full on orchestral\/progressive pop song on here is \"Optimist\" with Clarke on lead vocals. Towards the end of the album Byrne takes over heavy on the chunky,soulful groove of \"Lightening\" and the afro funk explosion of \"The One Who Broke Your Heart\" with the Dap Kings and the like minded afropop band Antibalas. The album ends with the slower,epic groove of \"Outside Of Space And Time\" with the swelling and romantic lyrical imagery suiting the music to a tee.\n\n  For many people who've considered the innovation of funk in dance music during the 70's as a passing fad usually indelibly linked with the still sometimes controversial disco era,Byrne has consistently proved critics and musical scholars wrong on that regard with his creative way with funk rhythms and his promotion of the original talents who produced them. Funny thing is,only on rare occasions has this ever attracted a wide audience. And for that mostly earlier on in his career. Since he left Talking Heads in the late 1980's,most innovations in pop music have been based in some variation on the dour end of the alternative rock scene. The funk end of it only seemed to crop up occasionally and even then pushed far into the backround with other things. Even if his solo work was hit or miss affairs commercially,he stuck to his guns that the 70's funk\/soul era provided the pop world with an excellent base for expansion in it's future. By blending that aesthetic with the musical and songwriting talents of St. Vincent he was again able to fashion yet another successful hybrid from this. An excellent instrumental and melodic epic that should be enough for even the most jaded musical cynic to realize,in terms of music,it hasn't \"all been done\".","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is an album for `everyman\", the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society, and his hopes and fears for its future. It is also a lovely, stirring, and  evocative song cycle that illuminates Jackson Browne's unique vocal and  instrumental arrangements, and sends one running for the door to buy more  of the albums of the early \"JB\" variety. My personal favorites on this  wonderful album are \"Our Lady of the Well\", a interesting and fetching  suggestion of Browne's social and political concerns blended with a  celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America, \"Take It Easy\"  written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the  Eagles, \"These Times You've Come\" about an old pair of lovers who still see  each other romantically after parting, and of course, the combination song  cycle of \"Sing My Songs\" and \"For Everyman\", which like \"The Deluge\" on  another album, sets out Browne's fear of a pending eco-disaster and  apocalypse. Browne is still around, still creative, and still as socially  and politically outspoken, but this is one of his best early albums, when  he was one of the most talented and creative young folk-rock luminaries on  the popular scene, a superstar a long time in the making.  This is a  `must-have' album for any real fan of Browne's music and for anyone just  interested in top-shelf folk-rock music by one of the seventies and  eighties greatest popular artists.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.\n While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  \"Lead On\" and \"King Of The Mountain\" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (\"I Can Still Make Cheyenne\" recalling \"Amarillo By Morning\" and  \"Adalida\"  bringing to mind \"The Love Bug\").  With \"Carrying Your Love With Me\" and  \"Carried Away,\" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.\n  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on \"You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody\" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as \"Blue Clear Sky\" and \"Round About Way\" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than \"We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.\"\n The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper \"The Best Day\" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (\"Love Without End,  Amen,\" \"Check Yes Or No).\"  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is \"Murder On  Music Row,\" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....\n As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.  In light of  its several strong points, however, it has to be recommended as a must buy  for all country music listeners.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"The 1964 winner for Best Album was this mellow but spright cool jazz album that pushed Latin bossa nova and samba rhythms on the map.  With a lineup that included Joao Gilberto on guitar and vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano, Tommy Williams on bass, Milton Banana on drums, and on the two most memorable songs, Joao's wife Astrud.  However, the driving force behind this was tenor saxophonist Stan Getz, and his straight-tone, controlled-vibrato sound.\nThe album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song, \"The Girl From Ipanema\".  This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese.  Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics:  \"Tall and tan and young and lonely\/The girl from Ipanema goes walking\/And when she passes\/Each one she passes goes haaa.\"  Well, the thing that makes me go \"haaa\" here is Astrud Gilberto's voice.  Getz's sax solo and Jobim's piano in the middle serves as a bridge between the two refrains.  There is a 45 rpm version of this classic, the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing, included later.  I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song, Bob River's \"The Girl With Emphysema\", and then sought hard to find out the original version, which led me to this album.\n\"Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)\" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto.  In the full 4:14 version, we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics, as he did in the full version of \"Ipanema.\"  There is a dreamy quality about this song, particularly when Astrud sings \"Quiet nights and quiet dreams\/Quiet walks by quiet streams\/And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely.\"  And Getz's sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim's piano.  BTW, Corcovado is the name of a mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.  There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well.\nAs for the rest of the songs, Getz's rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner, particularly his solo on \"So Danso Samba\" with its \"vai vai vai vai vai\" refrain by Joao Gilberto.  The song title means \"I Only Dance Samba\", as opposed to calypso, the twist, and the cha-cha that were sweeping the country's dance floors in the 1960's.  And Joao Gilberto's soft vocals complement the soft qualities of the other instrumentalists.  Only complaint:  Astrud should've been featured on more songs.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Like You're Under Arrest and Tutu, Decoy flirts heavily with synthesizers. Another thing it has in common with those two releases? None of 'em are all that good. I mean, this isn't a dog's dinner like it's made out to be, but it's not first-class Miles. \"Robot 409\" sounds like a bad cartoon theme, for god's sake, while both the title track and \"Code M.D.\" are beefed up electronically, seemingly to cover up their lack of any strong melody or instrumental solos. Now, I do think that \"Freaky Deaky\" makes good use of the electronic stuff - appropriately enough, it sounds freaky. And hey, \"What It Is\" is about the funkiest thing on this album, plus the squealing, Wayne Shorter-like soprano sax solo sounds nice. Meanwhile, \"That's It\" does have an amusingly unpredictable groove, making it worth hearing as well. And \"What It Is\" is stirring, that's what it is. So that makes it the best post-retirement Miles album I've ever heard, not like that's saying much.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is another fine collection by Cobra Entertainment, and an outstanding bargain particularly since almost all of the music presented represents complete works, rather than cuts, snippets and stray movements as is often the case.\n\nIn all there are 35 works in the collection -- or actually 34 and one third, since track 47 is the third movement only of Mozart's concerto for two pianos, K. 365. The performances are all good to excellent, and in general, feature well-known national musicians from various countries in central and eastern Europe -- particularly Bulgaria.\n\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer that the great Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando's performance of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is a major draw on its own and itself worth the price of the set. Although the rest may be gravy, it is actually fairly substantial gravy.\n\nA highlight of the collection is a complete cycle of Beethoven's five piano concertos, performed by Anton Dikov, a very well respected Bulgarian pianist and professor at Sofia's music academy. His Beethoven recordings have been packaged and repackaged countless times on classical compilations -- I'm sure due in part to their availability at a low price for the seller. But don't mistake cheap for low quality -- these performances are nuanced and enjoyable, featuring the Sofia Philharmonic under Bulgarian composer and conductor Emil Tabakov, whose recordings are available extensively on the Capricco label. Naxos has also recorded several of Tabakov's own works.\n\nBoth of Chopin's concertos are included, the first performed by Sandor Falvai, a piano professor at Hungary's Franz Liszt Academy, and the second by the noted Polish Chopin interpreter Adam Harasiewicz. These performances of the concertos often surface together -- as they do on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-CD\/dp\/B000001VFK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this CD<\/a>.\n\nGyula Kiss, professor at Hungary's Franz Liszt Music Academy turns in fine performances of Liszt's first and second piano concertos, as well as Mozart's \"Coronation\" concerto. Bach's concerto nos. 1, 4 and 5 for Piano, Strings and Continuo performed by respected Bulgarian composer and conductor Vassil Kazandjiev, with Dora Milanova on piano.\n\nThe disc closes with a great Concerto in F by Gershwin, played by French concert pianist Cecile Ousset and conducted by Sir Neville Marriner -- from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-CD\/dp\/B000001WP0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this CD<\/a>&nbsp;on the Capriccio label.\n\nI could go on, but the playing and recording is solid on this set. It is well worth picking up. '\n\nThe MP3 transfers are good, and bitrates are variable, averaging a respectable 209-246 kbps.

{"text":"In a world that is completely glutted with death metal\/grind imitators, it is so refreshing to hear a band that transcends the mere deathcore \"breakdown\/riff\/breakdown\" formula. And while Tennessee's Whitechapel are clearly not set out to reinvent the deathcore wheel, they do offer a little bit more than just clichs. Their fourth album, 2012's eponymous effort, is leavened with a surprising amount of melody, thus helping to heighten and offset the brutality, and doing so very successfully. And heck, there are even a handful of guitar solos to be had, here. But what is probably the most distinguishable attribute that the band possesses is exceptional (to say the least) musicianship. Ben Harclerode anchors the beast and drives it forward with spot-on, rapid-fire drumming, while his band mates dole out mostly memorable riffs and solid, steady bass lines.\n\nThe high pitched screams trading off with low death metal growls, and vocals that even verge on borderline pig-squeal territory, are laid over crunching, churning rhythms and Fear Factory-esque drumming, thus making \"Make It Bleed\" a propulsive and promising opener (even if it is one with a nicely melodic intro). And \"Hate Creation,\" an explosive and decapitating, mind-bending, blast beat-driven assault, makes good on the promise set forth by this opening song, as does \"(Cult)uralist,\" which marries a nicely clean and harmonic guitar solo with lumbering, churning, Meshuggah-reminiscent riffs. The mosh-pit-ready \"I, Dimentia\" piles high more ominous, pounding, Meshuggah-like licks, and thunderous rhythms, but it is mostly of note for being a breakdown-happy cut in that it stacks breakdown on top of another big and chunky breakdown. A decent melodic solo is included, here, too. Then, following the machine gun fast drum fills behind the blistering \"Section 8,\" we are treated to \"Faces,\" which is complete with a brisk drum intro and noteworthy, interesting, politically-charged lyricism much in the same vein as Misery Index and Dying Fetus. Other highlights of the record's second half include the oddly catchy, and thunderously chugging \"Dead Silence,\" and \"Devoid,\" a track that is completely instrumental, and aside from featuring a melodic guitar intro, is one that is positively foundation-shaking.\n\n\"Whitechapel\" isn't as good as the band's last release (2010's \"New Era Of Corruption\"), but it is still a satisfying album that shows a wealth of promise, and one that transcends most of the Christian extreme metal releases on the market circa 2012. All of which make it easy to recommend to deathcore aficionados, especially those who prefer the former subset of the genre over the latter one. And if you enjoy bands like Cryptopsy, All Shall Perish, The Red Chord, Job For A Cowboy, Decapitated, Cannibal Corpse, and\/or the aforementioned Dying Fetus, you will most certainly like Whitechapel a lot, too.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"For example, after \"Heaven & Earth\" Came out. I've been a Yes fan since their \"Yes Album\" after I'd dismissed the single \"Your Move\" as generic folk pop. But then I bought the next album \"Fragile\", which prompted a second look at the previous release \"The Yes Album\". Once \"Yours Is No Disgrace\" started, with it's opening trio riff between Bruford, Howe and Squire reminded me of the theme from the film \"Magnificent Seven\" by way of old \"Marlboro Country\" TV ads, I was hooked. So for one album to prompt me regarding an earlier album is history repeating itself. At first I was underwhelmed by the title suite of this album \"Fly From Here\" because it comes across as a medley rather than an epic. I know that other tracks this long have multiple themes within them, but this one is physically split into individual tracks. Which doesn't work well on an MP3 player because there's this hiccup between tracks that fortunately doesn't show on the CD. But the recurring theme is so like Yes, except this one sounds like Squire wrote it. He's always been the one to fool with eccentric time signatures (\"The Fish\" from \"Fragile\" with its 7\/4 beat). Only this riff is in 5\/4. Another song perhaps has Squire on lead vocals is the next track \"The Man You've Always Wanted Me To Be\". I can't tell whether it's Chris or if Trevor Horn did a cameo here--both are in that same tenor that kept Horn's voice from \"working\" on \"Drama\".","classification":4,"fold":2}

But every so often, even with great songs around, there is a moment or two where you can be a good group, but not with the best song made. That is the case with Nickelback's, We Must Stand Together, the lead-off single from their 5th album Here & Now. The song honestly is fair, but comparing it to their modern-day classics like Far Away, and Savin' Me, it honestly isn't one of their better songs. Still, at leats it honestly is better than those overexposed acts like Beyonce' and Lady Gaga have forced themselves to overexpose their music to sell well, rather than letting the songs speak for themself. Hopefully, there will be better songs from Chad Kroger and the boys down the road.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is a rocky album. Not in the 'it rocks' meaning of the word, but more in the sense that The Script deals with upheaval in love and politics. The trio of Dubliners waste no time in going for the gut with the opening \"You Won't Feel a Thing,\" which deals more with the austerity measures that Ireland is going through than a breakup. These former boy-banders have more on their mind than getting the girl; U2 echoes throughout \"Science and Faith.\"\n\nToo bad that \"You Won't Feel A Thing\" is the best song here. The Script know their way around solid melodies and good hooks, but they are smoothies from the school that also includes OneRepublic (they used to work with Ryan Tedder as producers), Snow Patrol and even Coldplay. The single \"Walk Away\" does make for good radio fodder, and the fine \"This = Love\" being the only song that really breaks the formula. Heck, \"Walk Away\" even features a rap cameo from B.o. B. in the 'everyone else is doing it' category. If you get the extended version, you'll likely enjoy the piano based and rapless version more, if only for the reason that the rap version sounds more of the moment than of the band.\n\nThat said, \"Science and Faith\" is pretty decent overall. There are moments that suggest The Script could break the rut and maybe find their way into Coldplay's creativity or (if they were willing to get away from the over-production) Maroon 5's pop-soul. Just too many times on \"Science and Faith,\" you keep wishing for the big payoff when all you get are little fireworks of inspiration.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Tony Martin I do not hesitate to say in my opinion is a better vocalist than Dio, especially in this live performance. The guitar and bass work is tight, and this just keeps moving from beginning to end. Great Camera work and splicing also.

This is truly evidence that rather than letting her more mature years slow her down, she continues developing.  Purists can say all they jolly well want about her voice quality deteriorating, but it just isn't so.  She's working with it and singing songs that reflect much of her perennial dramatic past, but mellower and upbeat.\nNo, there's no song titled \"Living Proof\" here.  But that title is a reference to the most outstanding song on the CD, \"A Different Kind Of Love Song\".\nAs a follow-up to \"Believe\", Cher is establishing herself as one of the musical legends with a lengthy career which keeps going.

{"text":"For my money they are the most important American rock and roll band in history. They were a phenomenon to be sure. And the statistics would tend to back up these assertions. Whether you were addicted to Top 40 radio in the 1970's or a fan of progressive or classic rock you were sure to find the music of Chicago emanating from your radio.\n\nIt all began with an LP entitled \"Chicago Transit Authority\" released in the spring of 1969. While the album would never attain Top Ten status it would remain on the charts a staggering 171 weeks! And from this LP would emerge a couple of classic hit singles \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\" and a tune appropriately entitled \"Beginnings\". And Chicago would never look back. Over the next two decades the band would have over four dozen hit singles and produce some of the finest and most successful albums of the period. \"Beginnings\" was originally released as a single in 1969 and it failed to make the charts. Columbia decided to re-release the single in June 1971 and it would become the band's fourth Top Ten hit. Outstanding!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Firefall \"is a rock band that formed in Boulder, Colorado in 1974. It was founded by Rick Roberts, who had been in the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jock Bartley, who had been Tommy Bolin's replacement in Zephyr. The band's biggest hit single, `You Are the Woman,' peaked at number 9 on the Billboard charts in 1976. Other hits include `Just Remember I Love You' (# 11 in 1977), `Strange Way' (# 11 in 1978), `Cinderella' (# 34 in 1977) and `Staying with It' (# 37 in 1981) with female vocalist Lisa Nemzo.\" (Wikipedia).\n\nThese five tracks are some of Firefall's best music. \"You Are the Woman\" has a sweet melody and Firefall does this really well--it's a classic that got lots of airplay when it was originally released! \"You Are the Woman\" still sounds good today. \"Just Remember I Love You\" also was a big hit for the band; just one listen will tell you why! The guitar is well used in the musical arrangement and this couldn't have been done any better. \"Strange Way\" features Firefall singing and playing at their usual very best; and \"So Long\" is an excellent tune. The track set ends with Firefall performing \"Livin' Ain't Livin';\" it leaves me wanting more from this awesome group!\n\nFirefall biggest fans will probably have most if not all of this great music already, so I think this music is best for the more casual fan or newcomers just discovering Firefall's incredible artistry. I highly recommend their music.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"There have been several compilations of Lorrie's music featuring various hits, but none of them are definitive, though this is the best yet. Among the hits included here are We both walk, Half enough, Good as I was to you, I guess you had to be there, Train wreck of emotion, Standing tall and Something in red.\nApart from the hits, this collection contains five new recordings. These include a live cover of Angel (a Sarah McLachlan song) and an excellent cover of Another lonely night, one of Tammy Wynette's less heralded classic songs. There is nobody better suited to singing Tammy's classics, as Lorrie has been divorced almost as often as Tammy. The other three new tracks are To get to you, If I cry and Whoop-de-do.\nLorrie, like me, has very eclectic musical tastes and it shows in her choice of material. Unfortunately, many people these days prefer singers to choose a particular style and stick to it. Because of that, Lorrie's determination to record a variety of material has limited her success. Unquestionably blessed with one of the finest voices in contemporary country music, Lorrie should be a bigger star than she actually is.\nIf you only want one collection of Lorrie's music, this is the one to choose. Many of the missing hits can be found on her CD in the RCA country legends series. I've already reviewed that and recommend it if you enjoy this and want to explore further.","classification":5,"fold":2}

The songs that she had made over the years have been both hit and miss. Twenty years ago, she was able to hit the nail on the head with having a song hit big from the movies, with Not Goin' Cry from Waiting To Exhale back in 1995. The song really was a great song. But her latest set of songs, honestly aren't as good as what she had before. Suitcase, the lead single from the Think Like A Man Too soundtrack, isn't exactly as a saying, \"I am leaving you,\" song, as strong as some of her other songs had shown before.

{"text":"For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304.\nI have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include \"Run 2 U\" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish \"Intuition\". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example.\nAnd when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. \"Becoming\" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with \"Haunted\". \"2 Find U\" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called \"Standing Still\" (or the second time, when it was called \"This Way\").\nAnother problem here is the lyrics. Songs like \"Fragile Heart\" and especially \"U & Me = Love\" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but \"Yes U Can\" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of \"Stand\"?\nI don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"Not bad for a dead man. The ghostly apparition of Cash stares out at you on the back cover. The final entry in the American Recording series, \"American VI: Ain't No Grave\" comes full circle with songs about death and afterlife. I wasn't aware that Rick Rubin was going to do another Cash album post-death, so when I saw this coming out I quickly ordered it.\n\nAll of the American Recording albums are great, they all have strengths and weaknesses, but by and large they are all worth owning. The haunting traditional title track is given the royal Cash treatment replete with graveyard chains and stomps like a corpse rising from the crypt coming to take back what is rightfully his. A strong cover of Sheryl Crow's \"Redemption Day\" from her 1996 self-titled sophomore album. Kris Kristofferson's \"For The Good Times\" can be seen as a farewell from Cash to his fans. They hymnal \"I Corinthians 15:55\" looks at the afterlife. Tom Paxton's \"Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound\" is an exceptionally well written song done justice by Cash's world-weary filter, one of the best tracks here.\n\nThe old country and western \"A Satisfied Mind\" is given authority by Cash's wisdom (check out Lindsey Buckingham's version on his 1981 album \"Law & Order\" for a different take). \"I Don't Hurt Anymore\", \"Cool Water\", \"Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream\" and \"Aloha Oe\" are all fine pieces to conclude the album.\n\nNever say never. I'm sure there must be some dusty recordings in a cobwebbed corner that Rubin has yet to clean up. \"American VII\" could be in the future. If not, this album is a fitting end to the Man In Black's legacy.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Eminem isn't really a Rap God. The title is just a metaphor. Rappers have been calling themselves \"King\" since Run-DMC's second album. They've been calling themselves \"God\" for a long time too, as Wu-Tang fans can attest, but the boastful declaration has received a recent surge in popularity. Kanye West's Yeezus album, released a few months ago, includes a song entitled I Am A God. Jay-Z is also one on his album. It's a new trend among popular rappers. What separates Eminem from the rest is that he generally raps better than they do. So when he follows along and calls himself a God, which the most religious of his detractors will probably consider blasphemous, it's a little closer to the truth.\n\nThe problem is that the song doesn't really match the claim. Not to say that it's a lackadaisical affair. It seems Eminem put a lot of effort into composing these verses, the third of which lasts for nearly sixty bars. It's just that rhyming a complex array of words at Supersonic speed doesn't compensate for a lack of clever or otherwise interesting things to say. The \"Columbine\" line is a nostalgic highlight; listen for the gun sound effect; and the Ray J bit is sort of funny, but most of this is just a long-winded Eminem rapping to a generic beat produced by someone he should've passed for DJ Premier. The hook is weak too. The song, based on the concept alone, would've been better without any breaks.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":2}

You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.\n\nThis collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including \"I'll Be There\", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.\n\nIt is wonderful reliving hits such as \"I Want You Back\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Thriller\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\", \"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\", and etc... 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":2}

It's not \"the only Stones album you'll ever need.\" It's one more Stones compilation to add the the ones you already own, with two new tracks.\n\n\"One More Shot\" is OK...good, not great, ultimately forgettable, but \"Doom And Gloom\" is classic Glimmer Twins. The lyrics are textbook sick Mick wordplay, with Keef slamming them home in riff-driven glee and abandon.\n\nThe music on the album is, for the most part, 5-star music (but I still can't stomach \"Angie\" or \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heatbreaker)\").\n\nMy take is that you should already own this music, and should purchase \"Gloom And Doom\" as a single MP3 (if it's available). Otherwise, it's a great addition to any classic rock library.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I don't get it. I just don't get it. I thought music had hit its low with BEP's musical brain aneurysm \"Boom Boom Pow\". I can autotune myself vomiting and that would be a better song. But then I heard this song.\n\nI looked it up on a lyrics site and was startled at what I read- 12 people wrote this song. Actually I'm amazed. It took 12 people to write lyrics like:\n\n\"I've gotta feeling\nthat tonight's gonna be a good night\nthat tonight's gonna be a good night\nthat tonight's gonna be a good, good night\"\nWhich is repeated for roughly 90 seconds before the song even starts. How about:\n\n\"Tonight's the night, let's live it up\nI got my money, let's spend it up\" (yeah, rhyming \"Up\" and \"up\")\n\n\"Monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, friday, saturday, saturday to sunday,\nGet get get get get with us, you know what we say-say, party every day\npppparty every day\" (We know what the days of the week are. Party every day???)\n\nOr what about the fact that \"That tonight's gonna be a good night\" is repeated 18 times, \"Do it\" is repeated 31 times, or the random use of \"Mazel tov\" or \"L'chiam\" (Is this that movie \"When The Wind Blows\" on acid? \"When the BEP Blows\"?)???\n\nYeah the beat is pretty catchy, you gotta admit. Though it's catchy the first time you hear it, and then the next 500 times you hear it makes you wanna find the nearest object that can be used as a weapon, and find some way\nto use it as means of killing yourself. I'd say \"Avoid\" but since this drivel is played roughly every 10 minutes, it's really unavoidable.\n\nPoor little state of music.","classification":1,"fold":2}

{"text":"This review is for the single \"Me And Bobby McGee\" as sung by Janis Joplin, lyrics and by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster.\n\nKristofferson and Joplin had a close personal relationship and, while the song was not written explicitly for her, the tune fits Ms. Joplin's style very well.\n\nHer voice is neither smooth nor melodic - it reminds me very much of Billie Holliday's voice.  And, like Lady Day, with Ms. Joplin it isn't about the tonality she brings to her work; it's the (to coin a too-oft used word) soul she expends when singing.\n\nMany singers can bring feeling into a ballad; very few can make the listener want to weep in sympathy with the singer's obvious pain and loneliness.  Sinatra, most certainly; he spent over 60 years with his main theme being loneliness (or the brief intermission of a new love before loneliness returned).  Billie Holliday; her life was filled with pain both physical and emotional and she brought every ounce of it into her work.  And Janis Joplin, whose body of work is small in the number of recordings but huge in the personality she embedded in the canon.\n\n\"Me And Bobby McGee\" (recorded a few days before Ms. Joplin's death in 1970) is a fine example of her music.  While the writing may not be necessarily on a par with, for instance, Cole Porter's work one must consider the different genre that Messrs. Kristofferson and Foster worked in.\n\nI highly recommend this recording - with the caveat that I have a personal emotional tie in to the record.  I was freshly back in the United States (just a few months) from the Vietnam war when Ms. Joplin passed away leaving this last piece with which to be remembered and her passing hit me with nearly the force of a physical blow. I had listened to her songs when I was with the U.S. Army and her loss at the age of 27 was hard to deal with - even though I had never met her in person.\n\nOthers who do not have direct experience of the 1960's may not bring the memories that those of us who lived through it to songs of that era - but I think that this particular song of Ms. Joplin's has stood the test of time and stands on it's own merit.\n\nHTH\n\nRegards,\n\nJim","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The Good\n\nHypnotic drum beats lead the charge on \"Feel.\" A catchy melodic chorus and subtle guitar riffs will take you the rest of the way. Soulful and emotional vocals dominate the piano laden ballad \"King of Might Have Been.\" You may make comparisons to \"Hard Habit to Break\" here, but the song does a great job of standing alone. It's the multi-part harmonies and warm brass that really draw you into \"Caroline.\" When you read the lyrics the song seems a little cheesy, but when you here how Chicago presents it, it's quite encompassing. Rascal Flatts makes an appearance on the optimistic ballad \"Love Will Come Back.\" \"90 Degrees and Freezing\" echoes the group's 80s high-end production and sound. \"Already Gone\" is loaded with plenty of pop-rock melodies and signature Chicago horns.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI thought that the remixed version of \"Feel\" was unnecessary. I didn't really care for the blandness of \"Come to Me, Do\" either.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI really didn't expect this album to be so good. Chicago returns with their thirtieth album, after a ten year break, and shows that there's no rust on them. XXX is a powerful and melodic pop-rock experience. I never really wanted to listen to Chicago post-Peter Cetera, but after hearing this, I've had a change of heart.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":2}

Everything you would expect of an album being progressive is delivered here and more.  The band does their music justice and it's such a shame that Benoit David kind of got a bad rap after coming out with 'Fly From Here' with Yes.  To be honest, that album is excellent even if the title track is a rehashed never before released track.  I think sometimes people just get so stuck in the mindset that a band can't have another lead singer that no matter what they do will never be enough.  Enough of the soapbox.  While Benoit David did an excellent job on the Yes album, on the three Mystery albums is where he really shines and stands out.

{"text":"The actor Terence Howard has ventured into the music form, with this, his debut album. According to the man himself, music is his first love, and if it came to having to choose between acting & music, music would always win out. So, what does he offer us, as a way to see if he is as talented a musician, as he is a actor.\nWell, firstly there's his voice. On many reviews I have read around the web, he has been castigated for his singing voice, which I think is a little harsh. Bob Dylan and Lou Reed are two artists that, to my ears, haven't got the greatest voices in the world, but that doesn't stop them from having success and award selling albums. To these ears his voice suits the music on offer.\nAnd to me that is the problem, the music on offer. Whilst not awful, there's not much here that stands out. Whilst it's pleasant sounding, it all kind of blends into a much ness. The exception to this rule and my favourite track on offer here is 'Spanish Love Guitar' in which Terence show cases his skills on said guitar. This is a lovely moment that I kept on repeat for a while, enjoying the soothing sound.\n\nI do hope that this isn't Mr. Howard one & only shot at a musical and that Sony back him with the means to produce a sophomore album.

{"text":"This album is beyond anything expected. They have really returned with this album. The concern of what happens with a band when there is a major split is big with fans. 2013 Self -titled Queensryche release with this version of Queensryche was a great effort, and confirmed that this was the real transition of queensryche. This album is the sledgehammer on the nail in the coffin to close any argument that this is Queenryche.  This album is the next evolution in queenryche. For the fans that have been waiting for the return of the power of Queensryche from their early days, this delivers. For those who like the polished sound of the Empire record that sold millions, this is the album. This album blends the past with the next step to the future for this band.  I do beleive this album offers something their most recent albums may not have had, the possiblity of Radio hits. Althoguh their 2014 effort was good and showed that the rebuild was on, Songs like Bulletproof and Hourglass i could see in rotation with the songs of today, noting some of the new bands like Five finger death punch and thier ballads that have hooked this generation into the rock world. The other thing this album does is really show the different side of Todd La Torre as well. The last album was strait up power and showing his range to stand up to their past catalog. Seeing them on their last tour as well would have show how he doesn't need any studio to polish his strong vocals.  I think this album shows that Todd La torre can go into all ranges.  Arrow in time, guardian, and Hellfire, the first three tracks, all echo the power of Rage for order with the polish of Empire, old school, but a fresh kick in the face for the band followign their efforts post post PromiseLand and empire which tended to drop to a more melodic and lesser power.  That being said, Toxic Remedy, selfish lives, and Eye 9, tracks 4-6, channel that sound of Empire and Promise Land, finding that tone of the Ryche during their biggest years. Again, I believe the Highlights and potential breakthrough to mainstream radio again are tracks 7 and 8 with bulletproof and hourglass being songs that have the balance of recent succes Five finger death punch and shinedown. Just us, all there was, the aftermath (tracks 9-11), capped with the title track Conditon human as the final track round out with a slower, more melodic sound with Condition human wrapping up the album as a whole. tracks 9-11 are where the band shows that again that they aren't just going to keep \"knocking our face off\" with Todd La Torre's power, which they easily could.  These songs are slower, but not drug out and overly melodic like some of the last few albums were before the change that was killing the fanbase to the last of the hard core fans like myself that held on. If you like that style, I suggest looking over at Geoff Tate's Operation Mindcrime project album, the Key, that came out a couple weeks back. Its a fair effort but seems slow and dated, and is what lost the fanbase and plagued the last few Ryche albums since.

{"text":"When it has came down to Matchbox Twenty, they haven't really made a impact in music for the past several years, and Rob Thomas has shown it on his own with his songs like Her Diamonds well. But when Matchbox Twenty was reuniting, they still have a lot to show in their music with Overjoyed, the second single from their album North. The song actually isn't a bad song. While it isn't as electrifying as what Matchbox Twenty had with their songs from before like Push, and Unwell. Still, it is a better song than the joke artists of today have made out of the music industry like Rihanna and others have made from the past year. While it isn't as catchy as She's So Mean, it still is better than what has been coming out recently. I do hope there is more from Matchbox Twenty soon. Because another decade from North would be too long, and joyous from the boys and Rob Thomas.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Following up a record like Sigh No More would be a difficult task for any group and certainly Mumford & Sons knew this. Do you play it safe and stick with what made you popular or do you shake things up and risk losing the tide of support you've gained? That's never an easy question to answer and every artist must make that decision for themselves. In the case of Babel the answer is simple: don't stray too far from the formula but find a way to keep it interesting. The payoff is, for the most part, satisfying.\n\nThe record bursts out of the gate with great strength. The album's title track is forceful and engaging, followed by the catchy \"Whispers in the Dark\" and the popular hit \"I Will Wait\". \"Holland Road\" continues in the same fashion, giving us the trademark melodies and poetic lyrics we've come to expect from the group. Everything that made their first release so surprising is still here, even if it doesn't sound quite as fresh as it did the first time around. It's hard to fault the band for continuing their unique sound, yet it does feel a bit less exciting, mainly with the middle half of the record. Songs like \"Lovers' Eyes\", \"Ghosts That We Knew\", and \"Reminder\" are not in and of themselves bad songs. Rather, they simply cause the middle part of the album to drag in too many ballads. A slightly different running order would have helped the pacing a bit more. The ending run of \"Broken Crown\", \"Below My Feet\", and \"Not With Haste\" end the album with a bang and they bring the record to a wonderful conclusion.\n\nBabel is a solid effort and its many accolades are well-earned. I find the tracks in the middle to be a bit too slow in the running order, though they are enjoyable when taken individually. M&S have a winning formula but it's also one that will eventually need to expand and grow in order to keep them from sounding too routine. This group is talented and I look forward to seeing where they carry themselves from here. I have faith that they can do it.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"The reason the performers are not mentioned in this collection is probably because they are well-known virtuosos and would not want their names attached to a $1 collection. I have been listening to classical music for about 40 years, and have heard both the best and the less. The \"less\" is what we usually get in these collections, but this time we got the \"best.\" Oistrakh? Stern? Horowitz? Ashkenazy? I don't know, but these performers are not the second-tier Eastern Europeans we're used to hearing on the Must-Have albums. This is the real deal. Grab it.\n\n*Correction: I see another reviewer has already caught it, but I did find out who the performers were when I saw this album listed on another website. I think it was on iTunes. Anyway, yes, they are not all the first-class performers I had hoped and thought they sounded like. But they are still good enough to make listening to this collection a valuable and worthwhile experience.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era. In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him. He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit. Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list. With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement. Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute. Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute. And it is a virtuosic display. Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Although I had known about their CDs like \"On The Outside Looking In\", \"Coming Out Hard\", and \"On Top Of The World\", I never had bought an 8Ball & MJG CD.  In 1998, I was heavy into No Limit Records and I heard a track on the \"I Got The Hook Up\" soundtrack called \"Let's Ride\" that was pretty tight.  Then once I heard \"Pure Uncut\" which was a track with 8Ball, Master P, Mystikal, Silkk The Shocker and Psycho Drama, I was sold on finally purchasing their CDs.  I bought 8Ball's \"Lost\" CD which included my favorite song \"Coffee Shoppe\" with 8Ball & Redman, MJG's solo CD \"No More Glory\" and eventually once they were relased, \"In My Lifetime Volume 1\" and \"Space Age 4 Eva\".  Two of my favorite 8Ball collaborations are \"Where I'm From\" w\/Mobb Deep on their \"Murda Muzik\" CD and \"Ride(Down South)\" w\/Foxy Brown, Juvenile and Too Short from her \"Chyna Doll\" CD.  You also can't forget about the 8Ball & MJG collaboration from Mase's 1st CD, \"The Player Way\".\nWhen I first learned that 8Ball & MJG signed with Bad Boy I was a little skeptical at first.  I know that Bad Boy does well as far as marketing their artists but I was worried that P Diddy might try to water them down a little bit.  However, I was wrong.  I happened to be watching Rap City one day and the video for \"You Don't Want Drama\" came on I was nearly speechless.  I just remembered turning the volume on the TV real high and nodding to the beat of the track. When I heard the CD, \"Living Legends\" was coming out on May 11th, I knew I would buy this CD the day that it was released.\n\"Living Legends\" definitely will reclaim 8Ball & MJG's spot in the Dirty South game, not that they ever lost their spot, but it had been a minute since they had the beats to back up their potent lyrics.  The first single, \"You Don't Want Drama\" is clearly the best song on this CD.  Shondrae definitely deserves props for this head nodding beat.  Shondrae strikes twice on \"Don't Make\".  In the video for \"You Don't Want Drama\", the video leaves from the club and then moves to the street, so I am thinking that they are still rapping the same song, come to find out that they had switched to \"Don't Make\".  If you are a fan of any 8Ball & MJG singles, then you definitely need to get \"Living Legends\" for these two songs alone.  However, they have more bangers for you as well.  \"We Do It\" is produced by Nasheim Myrick, who has been making beats for Bad Boy artist for years.  This song is as grimy as \"Don't Make\" as you are able to tell the chemistry that 8Ball & MJG have since they have been rapping together for so long.  \"The Streets\" is another banger that features Bun B from UGK as he is tring to carry the UGK name on his shoulders while Pimp C is in jail.  This is another song that can contend as best song on this CD.  \"Shot Off\" features Ludacris as 8Ball & MJG join Luda for a lyrical free for all as all 3 rappers hold their lyrical weight throughout the song.  \"When It's On\" features a nice beat by Yogi as you hear the beat and they have a nice piano drop throughout the song.  \"Look At The Grillz\" features TI and Twista and is produced by Lil Jon.  Lil Jon actually makes a beat where he's not screaming Yeah! and OK! throughout the whole track.  This song should be the next single in my opinion, as TI and Twista are 2 of the folks that are holding the rap game down in their region right now.  8Ball & MJG are allowed to speak about their \"Memphis City Blues\" as well and to tell some personal \"Confessions\".  The beat for \"Memphis City Blues\" has an old school feel to it as 8Ball & MJG speak a few lines about the town they represent.\nOverall, if you are a fan of 8Ball & MJG's earlier CDs, you can't afford to pass up on \"Living Legends\".  Being with P Diddy and Bad Boy has not watered them down at all and as a matter of fact they might be better than ever before.  If you are a fan of the New South which would include Ludacris, David Banner, Lil Flip, Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz, TI and others then their is nothing wrong with going back to your Down South roots by picking up \"Living Legends\".  Believe me, it will be worth your time.\nJames' Top 6\n1) You Don't Want Drama\n2) Don't Make\n3) Shot Off w\/Ludacris\n4) The Streets w\/Bun B of UGK\n5) Look At The Grillz w\/TI & Twista\n6) Memphis City Blues","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Not necessarily being an actual practicer of Wiccan i have always had an interest in it and what attributes it has. Having a large background in Indian heritage i can always say i have had an obsession with forests, water, the earth, and a closeness to nature in general. This album is a brilliant masterpiece of haunting ambient beauty and basically steals your soul and doesnt give it back until the album is over. All the songs are very in depth with much emotion but each one being its own entity. Staring off with Avalon (The Goddess of the Sacred Landscape) you really get the feeling sully puts his heart into it, also with the really great female vocalist he uses, its clear to see why the song is so beautiful and effective. 7 Years being one of the strongest tracks on the record is really a great song in itself, clocking in at just under 9 minutes it has a very powerful and moving vibe to it. I'll study more into what it means but i'm pretty sure it's the death of someone close, he's dealt with for 7 years. Broken Road is a great song very reminiscent of Geoff Tates solo song \"Someone Else\" only without the annoying high range vocals. The song sends chills up your spine and is obviously very personal mentioning Sullies father. Great track. Sinner's Prayer is a great Indian vibed track complete with chants, and orchestra which most songs on here consist of. Sully and the female vocalist(Lisa Guyer) whom i'm not familiar with, really help round out the entire album and as i said every song is great, at first they may seem to sound the same but give it a few listens, and you'll be hooked. I was on the first few listens, but since i only got it yesterday, its still fresh to me, will it stay that way? I'm sure of it.\n\nMost albums can take a while to get use to and some if you get hooked to quickly it will get old fast, i found this to be the case with Nevermores-The Obsidian Conspiracy, which i wore out, but still is great. Many people will probably dog the albums Wiccan theme as they do Slayer with there Satanic themes, oh well to each there own. The songs on this are just superb and it puts you in a very relaxed, meditative state in which you won't want to return from. Thats something few albums have, let alone try. The theory of Reincarnation is something i have been interested in all my life, so as i study it i truly love to listen to the songs here, The Departed and The Rise being the ones closest to the subject. So even if your not interested in any of the spiritual type aspects of the album, buy it anyways, you'll be happy to just relax, and take a departure away form the grind, and the usual music we are stuck with. Also yes the name Jesus Christ is mentioned about twice in the record so for all the believers this won't be a problem. You'll especially like the track \"My Light\" if your a fan of gospel, and if you get up and start singing with it, who can blame you? Nothing wrong with that. So hats off to Sully, at least someone has the balls to bring in there personal and spiritual beliefs back into music. And as far as i'm concerned this is in a category all its own. Godsmack are a great band, and i'm glad they do so well, but i always did like songs like Serenity, Voodoo, Voodoo Too, and Spiral, so i'm glad Sully took the time to venture out on his own and try something like this. I think people from all walks of music will appreciate this CD, and it will go down as the best album is about 20 years or more, for the kind of music it is. Also its great for fans of Conjure One, Deep Forest, Enya and even Tiamat. So enjoy, i do.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout \"Jessie's Girl\" to his previous release, SHOCK\/DENIAL\/ANGER\/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of \"Imagine\"?  Come on).\n\nTherefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit \"Human Touch.\"  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (\"Life In A Northern Town\" and \"Miss You Nights\" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Well, as much as we'd love to live forever in our favorite music from the past, I guess we can't expect to continue to get new \"old\" music forever. Artists grow, live, change....  Just as many of us would not wear the same clothes or hairstyles we did back in  the 70's and 80's, or even be that same person anymore, we can't expect our favorite artists to remain stuck in a box either. I actually like hearing them as they grow.\n\nIf you want new \"old\" Rumours, you are not going to get it here. Perhaps the closest you would get is the song Without You, which was written back in the 70's. But with Stevie Nicks' voice having gotten lower than back in the day, you still might not feel like you just stepped into the Rumours recording studio. But....the song does have a really nice 70's Mac vibe to it. I'm really loving it. To Stevie Nicks fans, her voice reaches our soul. Always has, always will. And whether it's a song she wrote in the 70's or in the 21st century, we grasp it, we get it, we love it.\n\nSad Angel reminds me more of the Say You Will Fleetwood Mac, or Lindsey Buckingham solo work. Neither of those are bad, but they are different than the classic Mac days. And that makes sense. I mean, it is 2013 after all.\n\nThe song It Takes Time is beautiful. Think of it as the modern, older and wiser Never Going Back Again. I could sit and listen to both those songs over and over. Just love them.\n\nSad Angel and Miss Fantasy are typical Mac pop rock songs. I never get tired of Lindsey's upbeat songs like these. They always energize me and get me in a good mood. And this makes me long for a new, full-length Fleetwood Mac cd. I just enjoy pretty much anything they do. Yes, I miss Christine McVie, but I still love the Nicks and Buckingham songs too. And Fleetwood and McVie give us a great rhythm. On this EP, you feel that especially on Miss Fantasy. I would love a music video for this song.\n\nI saw one review mention Lindsey's voice on Miss Fantasy. A few words he does sort of try to \"reach up\" higher than he is able, or at least makes it sound like that. But I assume he knows what he's doing and the sound\/vibe he is going for. The \"reaching\" feels like it fits in with the emotion and the lyrics of the song. Think of some of his more experimental songs on Tusk. He can be a bit of the crazy artist. He sort of almost half-whispers the verses and then that odd little note he reaches for....I just think - yup, that's Lindsey Buckingham for you. And I personally love it. It is a bit out there, like Tusk. Yet I could almost picture this song being on Mirage, I don't know why. Anyways, I absoutely love this song.  (And by the way, Fleetwood Mac, WHEN are you going to re-release Mirage? I NEED it. My cd of Mirage is awful. It don't even play loud. It's so quiet. Please re-release it asap. Your fans would love it! Anyone else dying for a re-release of that?)\n\nFor just $3.96 I couldn't resist getting this EP, and I am so happy I did. Now it's time to go make a mixed cd of my favorite Mac songs, and add all four of these to it. Thank you, Fleetwood Mac, for giving us a few new songs to savor. I'm really excited over them. I can't afford concerts any more, but I will always splurge on cd's and dvd's which are much more reasonable of a purchase than a concert ticket these days. Keep 'em coming . : )","classification":5,"fold":2}

Stan Getz makes each note sound beautiful, and three-dimensional, as if it were sculpted in blue velvet fog. Stan sounds less as if he was playing the sax than breathing the notes out from his soul. His contemporaries called him \"The Sound\".\nJoao Gilberto sings and wife Astrud sings with a rather small voice. Intimate and romantic. For more Stan and less singing, \"Jazz Samba\" is similar but all instrumental.\nTechnical note: The recorded this record at 30ips tape speed when the industry standard was 15ips.

{"text":"She was born Marie Lawrie on 11\/3\/48 in Glasgow, Scotland. Lulu was a pop singer and actress who burst onto the British music scene in May of 1964 with a lively cover of the Isley Brothers classic \"Shout\". At that point in her career Lulu was the lead singer of a group called The Luvvers. The record proved to be a substantial hit in the UK peaking at #7 but barely made the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. peaking at #94.\n\nIn 1966 Lulu left the group to pursue a solo career. It was just a year later that Lulu would make her mark both as a singer and as an actress. She appeared in the 1967 film \"To Sir With Love\" alongside Sidney Poitier. She belted out the film's theme song (which had the same title as the movie) in a memorable scene. The song skyrocketed to #1 on the charts in America and stayed there for 5 big weeks. Despite all of it's success in America I was flabbergasted to discover that the song never even made the charts in England. For some unfathomable reason the record company chose to release what was the B-side of \"To Sir With Love\" in the States \"The Boat That I Row\" as the single. For me it is always a joy to see the film and a pleasure to hear this song.","classification":5,"fold":2}

What may be surprising is that she's managed to pick out an album's worth--well,almost--of songs that hold the listeners interest,something she failed to achieve with the mostly half-baked BELIEVE(the obvious exceptions being the title track and 'All Or Nothing'). Which is a shame,because,like her magnificently underappreciated IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, LIVING PROOF looks to be losing what little momentum it managed to garner from BELIEVE's success, going the way of WORLD with little to no fanfare. It's even more disheartening considering that the song and vocal quality is literally light years ahead of her previous set, thanks to such first-rate tracks as 'Song For The Lonely','Alive Again','A Different Kind Of Love Song', and 'Love Is A Lonely Place Without You'. The only real snoozer here is 'Body to Body,Heart to Heart'(Memo to artist--cross Diane Warren off your \"go to\" list--she hasn't written anything remotely interesting in ages). The only other quibble is the over-use of that annoying vocoder--it was cool on 'Believe'(the first half a million times),but it's used far too much for it's own good here. Otherwise,LIVING PROOF stands as one of the artist's most consistent collections.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"The Crystals formed in 1961 with Barbara Alston as their lead singer. Quickly signed by Phil Spector for his brand new Philles label, they were the subject of the label's very first single, first hit and first Top 20, \"(There's No Other) Like My Baby.\" They struck gold again the following year with the Mann & Weil's brilliant \"Uptown\" and reached #1 with Gene Pitney's \"He's a Rebel.\" Oddly, the latter single, the group's only chart topper, was recorded by a completely different set of Crystals - Darlene Love and the Blossoms - than the one who'd first broken on the charts. The story has the original Crystals touring the East Coast at the moment the demanding Spector was ready to record in Los Angeles, and Love's group was on hand.\n\nThe Love\/Blossoms Crystals hit one more time, in 1963 with \"He's Sure the Boy I Love,\" before the original group regained their name with \"Da Doo Ron Ron,\" \"Then He Kissed Me,\" and \"I Wonder.\" Well, sort of. \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" had been recorded by Darlene Love and the Blossoms, but Spector replaced her lead vocal with one by Lala Brooks, to whom Alston had ceded the lead vocal role in the Crystals' stage show. The latter two singles also feature Brooks with Love and the Blossoms providing the backing vocals. The East Coast group split with Spector and Philles shortly thereafter, and amid additional personnel changes recorded a few more non-charting singles that failed to capture the thrills and grandeur of their hits.\n\nThis disc collects the group's ten charting singles (which also include \"Little Boy\" and \"All Grown Up\"), B-sides, album tracks, the short-lived A-side \"There's No Other Like My Baby\" (which was flipped to make \"(There's No Other) Like My Baby\" a hit), and the quickly withdrawn \"He Hit Me (It Felt Like a Kiss).\" Two rarities - the hard-swinging unissued-at-the-time \"Heartbreaker\" and the previously unissued LaLa Brooks-sung \"Woman in Love\" fill out the disc. This isn't a complete exposition of the group's recordings (their early version of \"On Broadway\" would have been a nice inclusion), and some will complain about the all-mono line-up, but with ABKCO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Best-of-the-Crystals\/dp\/B000003BDS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Best of the Crystals<\/a>&nbsp;out of print, it's great to have the group's hits and and B-sides available alongside collections for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ronettes\/dp\/B004GHBQEM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ronettes<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Darlene-Love\/dp\/B003102JKA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Darlene Love<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Phil-Spector\/dp\/B003102JKA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Phil Spector<\/a>.

{"text":"I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from this CD but was very pleasantly surprised. I had heard \"I Don't Want To Be\" on the radio and loved it. On a whim, I bought the CD when I was out shopping, and didn't expect the rest of the album to be so consistently good, but it is. While \"I Don't Want To Be\" remains my favorite track on the CD, there are numerous other standouts as well including the popular \"Chariot\" and \"Over-Rated,\" another of my favorites.\n\nThe beauty of the album is the eclectic amalgamation of styles from pop (obviously,) rock, and blues, with a weird alternative undercurrent. DeGraw undoubtedly has a powerful singing style (though he occasionally flirts with giving an overwrought performance,) and has clear command of the material and the needed vocal range to pull off these songs. For those of you who doubt this, give a listen to the bonus disc, \"Stripped,\" and his interpretation of the Sam Cooke classic \"Change Is Gonna Come.\" \"Stripped\" was one of the big reasons I bought the CD versus just downloading a few choice tracks: I love hearing alternate, unenhanced versions of music (e.g. \"Unplugged,\") and while not simply DeGraw and a guitar or piano (there are rhythm and drum parts) I really enjoyed \"Stripped.\" In fact my initial inclination was to give the album four stars due to some homogeneity in the songs as originally presented, but \"Stripped\" changed my mind, and made the five star rating the only logical choice. On balance I still prefer listening to \"Chariot\" in its original form, but \"Stripped\" provides a refreshing alternative approach to the material and the bonus of \"Change Is Gonna Come.\" You might not think a young guy like DeGraw could pull off the Cooke civil rights watershed, but he does so convincingly and respectfully.\n\nI am surprised I liked this CD as much as I did as I am not generally a fan of the genre, but DeGraw is clearly a talented performer and has genre-defying dynamism: \"Chariot\" is a really good effort, and will provide hours of listening pleasure.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is easily one of the best CDs I have in my collection and that's saying a lot--I have a fair amount of CDs! Randy Newman really blew me away with these songs and ballads that hit the nail on the head with so much social and political commentary--not to mention satire--while managing to keep the tunes catchy and easy on the ear. Randy's use of major and minor keys enhances the songs all the more, especially in stellar numbers like \"Lonely at the Top\" which discusses quite frankly the price of celebrity; \"Sail Away\" about slavery in America from the point of view of a slave trader in Africa during the time of slavery; deep thoughts about God heard in both \"He Gives Us All His Love\" and \"God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind);\" the evils of potential nuclear warfare in \"Political Science\" while pointing out that the people dropping the bombs would be too ignorant to realize that they're ruining the world instead of making it a better place; sex in \"You Can Leave Your Hat On;\" \"Memo to My Son\" which shows how an older man really doesn't know all that much about life; the memorable \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" and more. Several of the songs are also quite amusing such as \"Memo to My Son\" and \"Political Science.\"\n\nAnother thing I like about this edition of \"Sail Away\" is that we get some fine bonus tracks not found on the original CD release (and they certainly weren't on the original record album release, either). Listen for bonus tracks that are truly special like \"Let It Shine;\" a studio version of \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong;\" earlier renditions of \"Dayton, Ohio-1903\" and \"Sail Away\" as well as a demo of \"You can Leave Your Hat On.\"\n\nThis is a must-have album for any Randy Newman fan and people just discovering Randy would also do well to get this so they can enjoy it as much as I do every time I listen to it! I highly recommend this excellent album by the great Randy Newman.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Today, When You Give Yourself Away, We Fly By Night\n\nWhen Allan sings, \"I'm not an easy man to understand,\" he's telling the truth.  Allan is a curly character:  beneath his aloof Californian surfer veneer is a vulnerable heart that pulsates with sensitivity.  And just like all his albums, Allan vacillates between these two character traits throughout these songs here again.  On some of the tracks he puts his foot to the pedal rocking like these is no tomorrow.  Yet, on the quieter moments he casts aside his machismo for some heart -to-heart confabulations.  Such an approach has continued to garner respect from Allan's male fans while adding much to flourish the romantic fantasy of his female aficionados.  As with his other records, Mark Wright is again at the knobs and he's to be thanked for such a quality record without an ounce of filler at all.  As far as the backings are concerned, this is your typical contemporary country record--slick and polished augmented by some occasional fiddling and steel guitar riffs.\n\nAllan seems to be at his best when he delves into his soul-searching moment.  Lead single \"Today\" sits comfortably with Gary-Allan's classics such as \"Watching Airplanes\" and \"Tough Little Boys.\" Performed with shovels of emotions, Allan sings of a man not giving up on his girl until the day of her wedding.  Except that she's marrying another man.  Prepare a box of Kleenex when Allan sings:  \"Today is the happiest day of her life\/I should be happy for her\/So tell me, why are these tears in my eyes?\"  Though nothing quite comes close to this Titanic of a ballad, \"When You Give Yourself Away\" comes close.  Few men are willing to admit the vulnerability of committing to a relationship, Allan tells it in such a moving way without sounding whimsical.  A soothing Keith Urban-like ballad with deft shades of 60s pop, \"We Fly By Night\" is a homily about not allowing the busy activities of life to rob the joys of our relationships.  \"She Gets Me,\" harkens back to country music way back in the 90s, where sensitive love ballads over a gorgeous melodies abound.\n\nAllan does let his swaggering side emerge with the album's title cut \"Get Off on the Pain.\"  It's a forgettable busy barnburner with screeching guitars turned up to the max.  Thank God producer Mark Wright had the sense to turn down the mix on the bluesy \"I Think I've Had Enough\" - a coming-of-age confession of a man seeing the futility of a rambling lifestyle.  Allan is one who doesn't just sing about songs plastered with rosy glee, \"Kiss Me When I'm Down\" is a realistic portrayal of a dysfunctional relationship.  A mid-tempo narrative \"Kiss Me When I'm Down\" that tells of the protagonist's obsession with his girl that he's even willing to be abused by her in order to keep her.  It's a realistic slice of life that makes the song so intriguing.\n\nAs it's the current trend now with most country records, it's often tail end with an inspirational tune.  At times such songs can be pretty obligatory but not with Allan.  The opening line of \"No Regrets\" is arresting enough for mandatory listening:  \"Scarecrows and devils are the only things out this late.\"  \"No Regrets\" is tell-it-all confession of a life well-spent despite its detours that is so perfect for Allan's rugged delivery.  In short, \"Get Off on the Pain\" scores again with spades of heart tugging moments, honest confessions, and some rowdy party kickers too.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Being a massive fan of The Bangles' music since the early '80s, \"Doll Revolution\" was a long time coming for me, especially after the \"Behind the Music\" episode on them. I have been waiting for this cd for two years, let alone the past decade for new music from them in general. Now that I have the cd in my hands, it was so well worth the money and wait for the cd to arrive in my mailbox. \"Doll Revolution\" did not fail to disappoint me. There really isn't an artist or band that harmonizes as well as The Bangles do. \"Doll Revolution\" is a great reminder how well Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael's vocals sounds together. \"Mixed Messages\" is a great example the band's abilities to harmonize. On the VH1's \"Behind the Music\" episode on The Bangles, at the end the viewer was introduced to a sampling of \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Lost At Sea\" which are found on the cd, much to my delight. Overall, \"Doll Revolution\" is a mixture of \"All Over the Place\" and \"Everything\", the raw production of \"All Over the Place\" with the sweet melodies of \"Everything\". The best of both worlds if anything. Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael all sound as if the band never broke up in the late '80s. I loved every single song on the album. Not a single dud on the album. I sure hope it sees the light of day over on my side of the Atlantic. This is one cd I don't want to see swept under the rug.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Both of those tapes were consistently plugged into my car's deck back then.  I have since been able to obtain that early Anvil stuff on CD and I still love it.\n\nSo I picked this new one up partly because that documentary The Story of Anvil was awesome!  And I have to say I am impressed with Thirteen as well.  I agree with everything Lips was pitching when they were shopping this record around in the movie, it is great stuff.  The CD cover is blah, but the music is what matters.  I am not going to be overly critical of the music like some people have been because bottom line this is rock 'n roll, it has passion, and some great riffing, and it is Anvil and they are BACK.

{"text":"Before purchasing this new Bach Guild release, I made a quick check of my own collection just to be sure that I didn't already have it. After all, they've given us so many great collections by now that it's hard to keep track of them all. I don't know how many they've released altogether, and I sure don't have all of them myself, but I did find (somewhat to my surprise) that I've managed to accumulate 26 of them (now 27 with this addition), totaling almost 210 hours of music! That is remarkable, not only for the quantity of music but most notably for the bargains these sets have provided.\n\nAnd here we have the latest, this time bringing together 16 violin concertos from 14 different composers (Mozart given extra representation with three of his violin concertos). And as we've come to expect, very capable performances throughout. The two concerto performances by David Oistrakh and with Kiril Kondrashin conducting the State Orchestra of U.S.S.R are historic recordings dating from the late 1940's but presented here in very acceptable sound quality. Joseph Silverstein's recordings of the violin concertos of Mendelssohn, Mozart, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky are notable, as are the performances by Misha Elman with Vladimir Golschmann conducting, giving us concertos by Lalo, Saint-Sans, Bach, Nardini and Vivaldi. Contrast those historic performances with the Bruch concerto and Scottish Fantasy performed by the Japanese violinist Yuzuko Horigome\n\nThere is some overlap with the Bach Guilds earlier 'Big Violin Box' and 'Big Baroque Box Vol III' (see notes below) so for those who have already acquired that set this is a point to be aware of. Still, for 99 cents a bit of duplication is not objectionable.\n\nAlso note that track information provided by Bach Guild either here on Amazon or on their own website may not always be correct - see corrections below.\n\nFelix Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op. 64 -- Joseph Silverstein, violin;

{"text":"Yesterday the new (and final) Pink Floyd album The Endless River arrived in my mailbox.  As most Floyd fans know the album was derived from extra music from the Division Bell sessions back in the 90s when the late great Richard Wright was still on the planet.  David Gilmour and Nick Mason took these tracks and added significant additional music to create this new work to serve as a pseudo grand finale to the Pink Floyd saga.  These days I very rarely sit down with a good set of headphones and totally immerse myself in music, but for this one I decided to do just that.  The album has received mixed reviews from fans, but listening to it in the wee hours of the morning with everyone asleep and headphones on I have to say that this one is a winner.  It is a very subtle album featuring a lot of sonic soundscapes and dreamy instrumental passages.  The lone vocal track is the final one, that kind of sums up the story, and the end, of the band that has meant so much to many of us prog rockers over the years.  To my ears the music on the album harkens back to some of the bands very early stuff, with Saucer full Of Secrets and Meddle coming to mind.  The genius of Richard Wright was not that he was a flashy technically adept keyboard player, but he was able to create beautiful passages with the somewhat limited skills that he may have possessed.  David Gilmour of course is the consummate professional with a knack for creating guitar textures (both acoustic and electric) that transcend into the cosmos the best of what space rock mixed with blues has to offer.  Nick Masons percussion is subtle on this one, but he has the ability to add just the right touch to passages that provide the perfect accompaniment to Gilmour and Wrights music exploits.  All in all this is a wonderful final coda to a band that is truly one of the all-time greats.  This is not music to drive down the highway with in your care, or listen to on your crappy MP3 player.  Get the CD, put some headphones on, sit back and relax and just let this one absorb you.  You will not be disappointed.  This album has rekindled my interest in really concentrating on a piece of music with a good set of headphones.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I find myself coming back to listen over and over.\n\nThe Buddha says that desire is the root of all suffering. Tierney and group come roaring back with their latest \"Desire\". An album of thoughtful understated meditations on the materialist extremes and Spiritual bankruptcy of the last few years of the stock markets, people buying houses, cars and junk they could never afford, excessive optimism, the Financial Community and their free market idealogs who thru their greed and stupidity destroyed the Wealth of Nations.\n\nExcess Desire. \"Long Daddy Green\" and \"Paper Moon\" are cases in point, without sounding preachy she gets her point subtlely across. \"Fever\", \"Whatever Lola Wants\" and \"My Heart belongs to Daddy\" are less about the usual sexual topic than desire. Desire for everything!\n\nThere are a few places that disturb the flow, a beat like a migrane headache coming on, but these are done on purpose to emphasize the overall theme. And this is a theme album.\n\nFor my money Tierney Sutton and group are the leading edge of jazz vocal. Technically she's arguable the best in the business. Her only potential problem, witness her last album \"I'm with the Band\", is a tendency to overreach technically, do wierd or difficult things for effect and shortchange the emotional, especially that emotional connection with her audience. \"Desire\" is a big improvement, emotional without excess technical display.\n\nThe overall mood is wistful, the music is tuneful. The prodings of conscience. The dark album ends on the hopeful note of \"Skylark\".\n\nThe recording quality and image are excellent.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Ed Sheeran makes his play  for more mainstream sound on his second major label album \"X\" (multiply). His previous album \"+\" was a singer-songwriter triumph. I thought it was the breakout album of the year. It also established Ed as a bona fide star and an unlikely sex symbol. Yet after that explosion of success, Sheeran decides to mess with the formula. The resulting album is a frustrating mix of sensitive singer-songwriter material and urban hip-hop influences.\n\nEd has a rather thin voice to start with, and when he applies it to wrap he's whiter than Vanilla Ice.this takes up three of \"X's\" twelve songs. While the songs are distraction, they don't totally dilute the quality of the album. It's also worth noting it's also worth noting that \"X\" suffers from multiple producer syndrome, bouncing back and forth  between Jake Gosling and hip-hop icon Pharell. While Gosling handles the more sensitive singer-songwriter material, its Pharell that pushes Sheeran in the more urban direction. Sometimes it works to spectacular effect, as it did on the hit single \"Sing.\" \"Sing\" is a high point on the album.\n\nBut then again, you're stuck with the rap songs. The worst of these is \"The Man,\" which almost caused me to dock the album by a full star. Not only is the rap annoying, the song is unnecessarily censored. Sheeran, with all the twists and turns he makes on \"X,\" turns sheepish and bleeps a couple of f-bombs and a reference to defecating. If he's so intent on establishing his credibility as both a singer-songwriter and urban contemporary recording artist, then cutting out words that some might find offensive is cheap. You're a good enough singer and a songwriter that you could've easily used different words. Leaving them on the album only to cut them in post-production is not an admirable trait.\n\nOverall, \"X\" is a satisfying album. Sheeran is possibly one of the most gifted singer songwriters of the present day, and for whatever flaws this album has, it overcomes them just on the basis of sheer talent. If you're willing to overlook Sheeran's voyages into hip-hop and rap, (\"+\" also explored these elements, but not to the extent that \"X\" does) then you will enjoy this album. If not, then this review serves both purposes of being a warning and an endorsement.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Prince's final album, \"HITNRUN Phase Two,\" is a bittersweet affair for obvious reasons. It's heartbreaking to listen to it and realize how much Prince had left in the tank, as it's his most inspired album release since \"3121.\" The writing, the hooks, the grooves and the playing are classic Prince, and he sounds directly involved in the collaborations and arrangements in a way he hasn't since perhaps \"Parade.\" That said, you can't help but truly be happy that His Royal Badness ended his career on a remarkably high note, leaving behind an album that can stand with his earlier classics.\n\nFrom start to finish, \"HITNRUN Phase Two,\" is a breezy, beautiful and fun record. Several of the songs - \"Rock and Roll Love Affair,\" \"2Y2D,\" \"Xtraloveable,\" \"Screwdriver,\" and \"Big City\" - had been regularly performed live dating as far back as 2011, giving Prince plenty of time to perfect them for the studio. \"Xtraloveable\" was and is an especially welcome inclusion: it's the oldest song on here, dating back to 1982, and was a beloved and much sought after outtake by fans for years. It sees the light a day in a slightly less naughty but absolutely funky and fun update, with Prince sounding like he's having a blast.\n\nOther standouts include the socially conscious \"Baltimore,\" the lovely ballad \"Look at Me, Look at U,\" and the haunting, quietly epic \"Revelation,\" which features one final epic guitar solo from Prince. The album's closing cut, the Andy Allo collaboration \"Big City,\" isn't a grand farewell, but it's a sweet, touching final declaration of love in the vein of \"Adore\" and others.\n\n\"HITNRUN Phase Two\" is a touching final statement from the greatest artist of the last 40 years, in the zone for one last time and relishing every minute of it. If only we know what else we could have had.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Throughout R. Kelly's career, he has flipped-flopped back and forth between being `reserved' and being `cutting-edge.' 2009's underwhelming selling&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Untitled\/dp\/B002LLDT86\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Untitled<\/a>&nbsp;(a solid, Grammy-nominated R&B album) found Kelly assimilating to new trends and rehashing classic moments. Even when `Untitled' was more `reserved,' it still managed to sport a `parental advisory' label. 2010`s&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Letter\/dp\/B0048LDTKK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love Letter<\/a>, on the other hand, finds Kelly on the more `reserved' side. That said, Love Letter is a solid, enjoyable R. Kelly album, sexual, profane references or not.  No one would cite `Love Letter' as Kelly's best necessarily, but it is certainly one of his stronger effort in recent times. Critics who prefer the more overt, `over-the-top' persona will no doubt consider this album `too tame' or even `bland.'\n\nAfter the typical `corny' R. Kelly interlude (\"Love Letter Prelude\") which finds the singer ascending up a scale in thirds at one point, Kelly breaks into the pleasant, enjoyable \"Love Letter,\" which is a direct contrast to the `party-it-up' themed \"Crazy Night\" from `Untitled.'  The chorus is simple, yet memorable: \"Did you get my card\/did you read my love letter\/ did it touch your heart\/when you read my love letter.\"  Subtle it may be, Kelly sounds solid and \"Love Letter\" proves an appropriate, enjoyable opener.  \"Number One Hit\" keeps up the feel-good, low-key vibe. Kelly's vocals sit atop the restrained production well, supported by strings (pads), piano, and synthesizers.  The dramatic turn of the performance at the end is a very nice touch making \"Number One Hit\" feel like a genuine `hit.'\n\n\"Not Feeling The Love\" is nearly as enjoyable, featuring the archetypical electric-piano laden production not dissimilar from 1980s R&B.  Kelly barely breaks a sweat on the verse, but heightens the emotion near the end of the cut.  \"Lost In Your Love\"  is solid enough, though it is a cut where you would like for Kelly to `push himself' more as a songwriter.  Even though it is safe and could stand more direction, it is still enjoyable and by no means `filler.' \"Just Can't Get Enough\" is a better cut, clocking in at an incredibly brief 3:10.  The only quibble would be limited songwriting, but much like \"Lost In Your Love,\" it still remains a pleasant cut.\n\n\"Taxi Cab\" does a fine job of differentiating itself from anything Kelly has done up to this  point.  While \"Taxi Cab\" does fall into the `hole' of employing some of modern R&B's `bag of gimmicks,' Kelly makes the end result one that is much more positive than negative. Again working with a narrow scope of songwriting, Kelly makes this cut exciting, if for nothing else than comparing the `taxi cab' to the `hotel room.' Now that's our R. Kelly!\n\n\"Radio Message\" is one of the album's best and most dynamic cuts, changing the groove from a straightforward four patter to a six feel, channeling classic R&B (think 50's and 60's).  Kelly also allows himself to stretch out vocally.  \"When A Woman Loves\" keeps up this `Kelly transformation,' finding `Kells' achieving some excellent vocal nuances.  The biggest quibble is that \"When A Woman Loves\" is too lengthy, clocking in at over five minutes.\n\n\"Love Is\" featuring K. Michelle keeps the momentum high, with the only quibble being the questionable vocal mix (K. Michelle could be mixed a bit closer to the forefront of the mix).  \"Just Like That\" lays well, though \"Music Must Be A Lady\" is most definitely a show stopper!  Why is it when Kelly compares women to the inanimate that he has the most success as a songwriter? The best line - \"Hey sweet soprano, I want you to meet Mr. tenor...\" \"A Love Letter Christmas\" is appropriately place in a timely manner for the holidays, while closer \"How Do I Tell Her\" ends the album as strongly as it began.\n\nEssentially, Kelly `knocks it out of the park' on this effort, albeit more conservative than say his Twelve Play albums or his assimilation to hip-hop, 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Double-Up\/dp\/B000P29B3U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Double Up<\/a>.  Regardless, Kelly has always and will always be a musical chameleon; he always pulls off whatever experiment he tries whether it is songwriting that compares ladies to any and everything or \"Trapped in the Closet\" with it's millions of chapters.  `Love Letter' is a must for any R. Kelly fan.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"`Ahmad's Blues' was a live jazz club recording in Chicago in 1958 originally released by the world-famous Chess Records. This re-mastered MCA CD is enjoyable from first bar to last. Jamal lays back in the groove with Israel Crosby on bass and drummer Vernel Fournier, and gives the obviously appreciative audience a rollicking good time.\n\nJamal is one of the greatest ever jazz pianists. His virtuoso playing is surprisingly accessible and easy to listen to. This is not just Ahmed and his rhythm section but a tight trio who obviously loved playing together, with space given to the other musicians to shine. The trio work through 16 great numbers; a couple of the band's own compositions (the opening title track and `Seleritus') and improvisation around some well-known icons from the canon - `Autumn Leaves', `Stompin at the Savoy' (listen out for a subtle and witty reference to the French National Anthem) and `Cheek to Cheek' stand out, but there is nothing less than very good here, and much which is truly outstanding.\n\nThis is the kind of very high quality, relaxing and almost chill-out CD you can (and probably will) play again and again at home, as background to many activities, in the car and anywhere you care to be accompanied by good music which is not too insistent, doesn't mind if you can't give it your full attention but rewards you if you can. It's in the same general groove as `Kind of Blue' and Cannonball Adderley's `Something Else'.\n\nMiles was a great fan of Jamal's playing, which comes as no surprise.","classification":5,"fold":2}

As with her sophomore effort, only to a greater degree, Morrisette manages to bog down her potent melodies with cluttered, New Age garble--it's criminal that she has such a way with a hook, considering that she continues to betray her own best efforts with her overly verbose, undisciplined style of songwriting.  Tracks such as 'Hands Clean' and 'Surrendering' chug along with terrific urgency--until you attempt to listen to the lyrics.  In fact, about two minutes into each track, you'll be scratching your head wondering\"When is THIS song going to end?\"  It makes one long for the days when this screaming banshee was singing about going \"down\" on her lover in a theater.

{"text":"The original soundtrack to the 70s movie featured the voices of Irene Cara and Lonette McKee. Even though audiences obviously liked their versions, for some reason, probably commercial, Aretha was hired to reinterpret the songs. I think the market could have bore both the original soundtrack AND Aretha's. Aretha's would have probably triumph but audiences were not trusted enough to make their own choices.\nBut if Lonette McKee and Irene Cara weren't marketable, Carmen Ejogo is even less so. Jordin Sparks sounds even more tentative especially on original song \"Look into Your Heart\". (For a further reality check on how Whitney's voice has changed, listen to her version of that song on the 1994 tribute album to Curtis Mayfield....she was in a different zone entirely).\nGoapele's \"Running\" is probably the best thing on here. Cee-lo is not quite as charming as on \"F-You\", but, the music on \"I'm a Man\" is hot.\nJordin sounds a little better on \"One Wing\" and \"Love Will\", but, that's only comparatively speaking.. I am trying to like \"Celebrate\", but, should I really have to try? The song is just not very strong.\nWhitney's performance in the trailer looks sweet and sensitive and encouraging. Maybe that is where we'll find the \"Sparkle\" because it is most assuredly NOT in this soundtrack.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"This very soothing song that is really a prayer in a song was a blessing to hear because it seems like this song\/prayer was made for Jackie to sing. In the song she is praying for others that are less fortunaute than herself. She talks to God and tells Him that she is just a child and does not understand all things, but yet she understands that prayer is so needed in this world.  After I downloaded it, I listened to it a couple of times in a row and really thought about what the words in the song mean. For me, I am somewhat new to listening to Jackie Evancho, yet I will stay listening to her music and downloading more. What is so special to me about her music is that she sings from her heart. And of course the fact that her voice sounds so heavenly. Her very rare and special voice is truly a gift to mankind.\nHighly recommend this song.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Sometime around 1978 my Mom got me the Red album and Doug got the Blue Album, or at least that is how we adopted them. I used to sit in our comfy brown swivel chair next to the stereo with the headphones on and read the lyrics and look at the gatefold photo. I'd sit there and wonder how the one kid got to be on the other side of the fence. And the kid in the middle looked sad and kind of out of place, but he seemed pretty cool, too. I always liked how Ringo was at kid height, all hunkered down. The lyrics to the songs were printed on the sleeves, so you could follow along. I really liked Paperback Writer because it told a story and I liked books, and it wasn't about girls and all that hold your hand stuff. The way the vocals cascade all over themselves from the top, and the way they echo around after writererererer....so trippy .The guitar riff is great, but i don't think I appreciated it at the time. I could also imagine the Monkees doing this one, my favorite lunch time entertainers. Anyhow, it's a fun Paul song.

{"text":"Very good CD but doesn't get 5. Its still very good.\nNot as much guitar scratching, some good harmonious parts, some breakout heaviness and shorter songs. A different release for sure than prior stuff. Vocally for sure. most is much cleaner.\nThey always had hit or miss tracks, but the HIT tracks were really strong. Here there is a lot of consistently good stuff, yet nothing extremely mind blowing.\n\nNot to say this isn't a great listen and certainly not a time consuming one, but hardly a game changer as some reviews describe. Merely evolution for a band trying to get to the next level. Makes sense.\nBut it hits its mark in most spots, just seems to have a slight amount of filler for such a short listen. The mind blowing parts don't totally make up for the soft spots in my opinion. That is strictly my opinion. But its definitely worth a purchase.\n\nA must buy regardless of minor flaws. Just not a 5. Good growth for a great band though. Spend the $10","classification":4,"fold":2}

At times, the tracks have a Kraftwerk feel to them. Fans of minimal synth and modern Euro-Rack enthusiasts will eat this album up.\n\nThings not to expect with this release:\n\nPop hooks, vocals, or catchy material meant for safe consumption. The structures of these \"songs\" do not follow the usual Depeche format and are entirely experimental.\n\nAs a fan of instrumental electronic music and Depeche Mode, I think its a cool album. Not essential by any means, but its a fun ride meant more for chill sessions than a night drive through the city. Personally, I think the average Depeche Mode fan will dislike this record due to its uncommercial nature. However, folks who enjoy analog synthesizers for the magic and texture they provide will find plenty to appreciate with MG.\n\nRecommended.","classification":4,"fold":2}

We have pieces from musicals made current to us through film such as Les Misrables and Phantom of the Opera as well older musicals such as The Wizard of Oz and The Fantasticks and in-between with Chess and Notre-Dame de Paris. Stages is a worthy addition to Broadway tributes owing to a first-rate production (and not being overly produced), a straight-forward yet contemporary take on the numbers (it doesnt try to make them something they're not) and, well, Josh Grobans voice. Lets face it, the boy can sing. Some of these songs seem to have been covered mostly by women, so its nice to have a male version but best part is that he has one of the best voices around. While the album is full of nuggets (What I Did for Love and his duet with Kelly Clarkson to name two), for me, the highlight is Bring Him Home.\n\nFor full review: http:\/\/fdrmx.com\/josh-groban-stages-deluxe-version-track-by-track-review\/#ixzz3Ycj0emg4","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Beautiful Liar (Beyonce & Shakira) \/ B0018Q16DU\n\nBeyonce and Shakira both have incredible voices, so this duet is nothing short of perfect blend of perfect talent, and is worth listening to for that fact alone. But I also dearly like the lyrics - the song is between two women who find out that the man they trusted has been seeing them both, secretly. Instead of the more common musical fight over who will win him in the end (see Brandy's lovely&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Boy-Is-Mine\/dp\/B000007NCC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Boy Is Mine<\/a>), Beyonce and Shakira ask one another if they can't just consider themselves lucky for finding out when they did, and can't they just laugh it off and go on with their lives? What, really, have they 'lost' beyond a \"beautiful liar\"?\n\nWhat's really meaningful is that though the two women recognize that the best response would be to shrug the whole thing off and move on, it's clear that this response is by no means easy and that the process is still unfairly agonizing to both women. It's a rare song that manages to be empowered without being trite, and realistic without being overwhelmed with self-pity.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":5,"fold":2}

Or so I thought! When \"Toxic\" came out, it honestly annoyed me but the more I heard it, the better it sounded. I realized this was a departure from the simplistic arrangements I'd come to expect from Britney, it was actually full of layers of sound and lyrics that had something to them.

{"text":"Like with a handful of the albums I own in my now far larger CD collection, this album has been in my possession since I was about 14, so needless to say, I should have done this review a very long time ago. Straight to the point: I really have to say that this is my absolute favorite Metallica album of all time. As a perfect follow-up to \"Kill 'Em All\" the sophomore album \"Ride the Lighting\" marks a point in their career when they were in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal, making a name for themselves as a band, and further rising to prominence in the '80s metal scene.\n\nWith a dark and eerie atmosphere, coupled with massive, thundering guitars, skull-crushing drums and raspy vocals, no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfied upon even the first listen, and will never want to skip over any songs. Every one of the songs on this album is a perfect illustration of what defined the true sound of Metallica and what made them such a great band. From the high-speed, neck-breaking insanity from songs such as \"Fight Fire With Fire,\" \"Trapped Under Ice\" & \"Creeping Death\" to the more steady, yet eerily menacing \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" and \"Fade To Black,\" this is the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any true Metallica fan.\n\nHonestly, there is so much more I could say about this album that other have said before, I could go on all day about it! This, my friends, is the TRUE Metallica in their prime, and the defining sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it. Sadly, this period of their career in which they valued their art and staying true to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the '80s. We all know how they started to care more about money and sold out to the mainstream by going in a more alternative direction, ultimately destroying their own legitimacy as a metal band (See my review of their self-titled \"Black Album\"), but at least we still have this album, along with \"Kill 'Em All,\" \"Master Of Puppets,\" and \"...And Justice For All\" to remind us of how awesome of a band they used to be.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely one album that makes no sense not to own, if you consider yourself a true Metallica fan, or a true metalhead in general. Just buy this album already! You know you want to. HORNS UP!!! \\M\/\\M\/","classification":5,"fold":2}

In other words, these are the times of Green Day input. Undoubtedly this was protest, not punk. I did download the MP3 from this site but not to cherry pick. This album from Green Day, 21 Century Breakdown from what I have read is another memorable offering from the Oakland generational heroes and as soon as my backlog shrinks somewhat I will purchase the CD.\n\nJay Adler, Music Critic","classification":5,"fold":2}

He still has that distinctive voice and his lyrical skills are as good as they have ever been. Yes, the lyrics on this album are a force to be reckoned with; he obviously devoted much time into writing these songs. \"Shaka\" is a song which pay tribute to those who have passed away.  \"Johnny is Dead\" is full of great one-liners.  This track has a rock feel to it and Q-Tip does a fine job with delivering the lyrics.  Raphael Saadiq lends his vocals to the track, \"We Fight\/We Love\" and the result is marvelous.

And they are all very good.  Although she doesn't do other artist's covers like Jolene well.  But she writes most of her own songs anyway.  And I have wished she would do a cd of songs she's written that were hits by artists like I'm That Kind A Girl, Hey Cinderella. Strawberry Wine. Wrong Side Of Memphis,  Stuff like that.  This cd does have You And Tequila.  It and Your Husband Is Cheating On Us and South Of Heaven are Highlights.  Also this has nothing to do with the cd.  but I got this idea when the song You and Tequila was out.  I am a big Dallas Cowboy fan.  But not a fan of Tony Romo.

{"text":"There is absolutely no question that with R&B singers, they have been more lagged at the soul, than really feel more authentic from the heart. It has been the case with too many crooners today. But when Marvin Gaye was around, he sincerely showed his soul so uniquely in a place and time where his sensuality in song at hand and voice. Sadly though, it has been over thirty years since he was violently murdered by his own father. But honestly, his work has been bigger than life today, even though he is not here anymore. His last major hit, Marvin's only big hit when he left Motown for CBS Records, Sexual Hearing is one of those tracks that still delivers from the swooning of the seductive soul. It is one of those songs that continues to show why Midnight Soul has a very deep place in so many hearts. It is a song that really is worth its money every time you listen to it. If you had never heard a Marvin Gaye song before, well this song is one that I recommend that you do go to from start to finish. It might've been Marvin Gaye's last big hit, but it is still sexual at the soul.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":2}

I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.

(or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review...

Instead of being Christlike, some stay in their little cliques, paying no attention to those who need to experience the love of God.\n\nAnother message - and the main reason why this is an important song for parents, guardians and youth leaders to share - is that when a young woman engages in premarital sex, it isn't always about sex. I believe that, sadly, these lyrics ring true for many females:\n\nShe is yearning for shelter and affection\nThat she never found at home\nShe is searching for a hero to ride in\nTo ride in to save the day\nAnd in walks her Prince Charming\nAnd he knows just what to say\nMomentary lapse of reason\nAnd she gives herself away\n\nThis song is an enlightening truth for Christians with a message of hope for lost and lonely people.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The Grateful Dead took a hiatus after the October 1974 run at Winterland and, with the exception of four \"surprise\" shows in 1975, didn't play again until June 1976. The first two shows were held at the Paramount in Oregon before heading to Boston for four shows at the Boston Music Hall. This release is from the first night on June 9th and was the third show on the \"comeback tour\". The first set starts with a nice Cold, Rain And Snow which has Jerry struggling with the lyrics here and there. Next up, is an early version of Cassidy which was played once at the Cow Palace in March 1974 but didn't become a standard in their set lists until the 1976 arrangement having been played at both previous shows. Scarlet Begonias is well done but I should point out that the jam is on the short side. Two songs from Blues For Allah are next and have been previously released on the bonus disc Spirit Of '76. The Music Never Stopped is hot while Crazy Fingers is played to near perfection. Big River is given it's usual stomping rendition while They Love Each Other is played at a much faster clip than it would be later on. Looks Like Rain and Ship Of Fools are given sweet readings. The set is driven home with a rocking Promised Land.\n\nThe second set starts with the revival of Saint Stephen with the opening missing from the soundboard tape. It does fade in before the lyrics start. Eyes Of The World starts hot on the heels of Stephen and rather than opening with the verses, it opens with the ending Phil lead jam near the end of '73\/'74 versions. A smoking Let It Grow falls out of Eyes Of The World. Brown-Eyed Women and Lazy Lightning->Supplication are cool upbeat versions. High Time and It Must Have Been The Roses are standouts and like the earlier Ship Of Fools, well played and sweetly sung. Samson And Delilah makes it's third GD appearance but is strong enough to tear that old building down. The set is rounded out with a strong run of Dancin' In The Street->Wharf Rat->Around And Around. The band encores with Franklin's Tower. The bonus songs that round out the release are from the fourth night and feature very strong versions of: Mission In The Rain, The Wheel, Comes A Time and Sugar Magnolia->U.S. Blues->Sunshine Daydream. Not every version here is a standout and there are some rough patches but this release is still definitely deserves a spot in every Head's collection.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"It's been three and a half years since we last heard from Sacramento's finest. With their eighth album, \"Gore,\" Deftones make up for lost time, having grown considerably and expanding their scope somehow even further than that of 2012's superb \"Koi No Yokan.\" For \"Gore,\" the band teamed with producer Matt Hyde (Slayer, Monster Magnet) to create perhaps their lushest and most adventurous album since their 2000 break-through, \"White Pony.\"\n\n\"Gore\" is at times a contradiction. While most of the \"anger\" that permeated their early work has all but evaporated, the album itself contains some of the band's heaviest and most dense work. And yet, at times it sits as the most dreamy and mellow of anything the band has attempted before. It's an awkward term to consider, but \"Shoegaze Metal\" might be the appropriate label for what Deftones have concocted this time around.\n\nThe album opens with probably the most soothing track the band have ever opened an album with in \"Prayers\/Triangles.\" It sounds almost as if '90s era Helmet is merging with My Bloody Valentine with vocalist Chino Moreno at the helm. This brilliantly sets the tone for the wildly unpredictable 11 tracks that flesh out \"Gore.\" Just when you think you've got a handle on where they are going, guitarist Stephen Carpenter leads the group into some classic metal riffing on the standout track \"Doomed User,\" lending credibility to the theory that no other band on the planet can be as beautiful and as heavy as the Deftones can. \"Phantom Bride\" is classic Deftones (right down to its title) with a twist: Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains lends a gorgeous solo to the back half of the song that takes it to a whole other level, melding perfectly into the arena-ready closing haze of \"Rubicon.\"\n\nPerformance-wise, the band are as tight as ever, with Carpenter and Moreno weaving in and out of each other beautifully (there were reports that Carpenter himself wasn't satisfied with the end result, which were then of course squashed by the man himself). Bassist Sergio Vega is at this point -- three albums into his career with the band -- fully integrated into the band. You can hear him channeling some of the signature Quicksand chugging throughout the album. Likewise, Frank Delgado, the band's turntablist turned keyboardist adds so much to the band's sound that it's hard to imagine a time where his role in the band wasn't so prominent. As always, though, the secret ingredient here is drummer Abe Cunningham, who glues and fuses everything together with seemingly minimal effort. His performance here isn't showy, it just serves to really tie everything together. In the annals of great rock drummers, it's a shame that the man has yet to receive his day in the sun.\n\nTwenty years into their career and there's a reason we are still talking about Deftones even as many of their more successful peers have stagnated, disappeared and painted themselves into irrelevancy. The group's willingness to always push their music into new directions while staying true to their original sound continues to persevere with \"Gore,\" an album that will truly leave you itching for more.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"Shine your light, Shine your light on me\"\n\nOn November 17, 1978, Bob Dylan picked up a silver cross that was tossed on stage by a fan at a concert in San Diego, California, that was nearly marking the end of a year-long tour. He then had a vision of Christ while in a Tuscon, Arizona, hotel room, and - at the final tour date in Miami, Florida - debuted a new song, Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others), which began the merging of Dylan's new personal faith as a born-again Christian with his music to produce his greatest studio effort ever.\n\nReleased in August 1979, Dylan's trek into Christian teachings and philosophy are heard in the nine songs, that clock in at about 47 minutes, with the album reaching number three on the U.S. and number two on the U.K. album charts.\n\n\"I just can't make it by myself\"\n\nThough most of the instrumental focus is rightfully on the Muscle Shoals Horns and Mark Knopfler (g) & Pick Withers (d) of Dire Straits, the powerful background vocals of Carolyn Dennis, Helena Springs and Regina Havis place exclamation points on the powerful gospel numbers.\n\nGotta Serve Somebody does not skirt the stark consequences when a person willfully elects to pursue the avenues of evil. Precious Angel has an utterly beautiful melody and you will not hear as powerful a sermon from any pulpit as found in Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking. The guitar solos by Knopfler on Slow Train compliments the classic Dylan lyrics and America 2007 is found in When You Gonna Wake Up, as provocative a protest song - written for 1970s America - ever penned by Dylan.\n\n\"I'm a little too blind to see\"\n\nBut the song, I Believe in You, which concerns being cast out due to unpopular religious beliefs, seemingly set the stage for a six-month tour - starting on November 1, 1979 - to promote the album. Dylan would not play older compositions - radio ads and other media material informed fans of the tour structure - and he oftentimes spent portions of the concerts lecturing hecklers who yelled out song requests or derided him for his Christian beliefs.\n\nBut what was lost in much of the critical noise then is Dylan's powerful messages of protest\/patriotism, fellowship, friendship and love - themes that he had written about in the past - were given additional meaning when a rainbow of promise & hope appeared in his life. That he wanted to share his faith with others made his personal mission to spread the gospel even more wondrous.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The music of the 70's today has shown a definitive effect on what we hear on radio and on television today. Although there are times where we see the past as something better than the future. That has been the case with acts putting their music into musicals like Billy Joel for Movin' Out, and John Lennon's music for the short-lived Imagine. That also has happened with Earth Wind & Fire, who recently had there catalog of great songs showcased for the upbeat Off-Broadway show Hot Feet. It still has proven that there music hasn't been forgotten by the public at all, and this collection of their music is also not forgotten either.\n\nEarth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits is a single disc reflection of the group during their 1970's hey day and all of the tracks that are still just shown as true guilty pleasures today. The songs on this collection still stand out today, and they sound better than they did before on this collection. The album includes classics like their standard Shining Star, the soulful and elequent After The Love Has Gone, Fantasy, the funky & upbeat September, and Let's Groove. They are just delightful to listen to, and still stand out very weel with the essence of Disco, Soul, Funk & R&B.\n\nAlthough it is a shame that the group hasn't captured what they had back in the 70's, but Earth Wind & Fire are still great to listen to today. Their 1998 Greatest Hits is a truly a really definitive record, and I absolutely recommend this a whole lot for anybody who wants to be a shining star.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nRemastering: A\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Audiomachine is one of my favorites in the genre of epic trailer music - their work is used mostly in movie trailers and other film\/television advertising.  Fortunately, there are a number of albums that Audiomachine has made available for purchase by the public.  \"Tree of Life\" is their fourth public album, and once again they have exceeded my expectations.\n\nUsually in my soundtrack reviews I list a few of my favorite tracks.  If I had to single out a few tracks, I would say the ones that stand out at the moment are \"Above and Beyond\", \"The Fire Within\", \"Homecoming\", and \"Final Hope\".  But this is one of those rare albums where each and every track is worthy of your time.  There's not a weak track to be found; the album works best as a complete experience and not a single one of the tracks feels out of place.\n\nAudiomachine is very eclectic - they have proven they can do intense, suspenseful, dark and tragic.  But \"Tree of Life\" is their lightest album yet - most of the tracks are very inspirational and uplifting.  I think this is my second favorite album they have done (I would say that \"Chronicles\" remains their best work).  This album is highly recommended!\n\n*Note: the Amazon MP3 version has 26 tracks totaling over an hour of music.  However, the iTunes MP3 album has 29 tracks (and the 3 bonus tracks are very good).","classification":5,"fold":2}

I'll admit he doesn't have the best flow of the group or even the best rhymes, but there's something about his voice that is commanding. On this album, he brings that commanding force and rhymes really well on some songs, does good then loses his momentum, or just kind of talks in rhyme. The beats are off the hook, the music does have alot of soul in it, but I can't give this 5 stars because Masta Killa made a really solid effort but it wasn't something that I'll be spinning again anytime soon. The shout-outs to all his influeneces and his tribute to Ol Dirty, that was a really cool way to end things I gotta say. People who say this is not worth your time and bad, I wouldn't go that far.

{"text":"I admit I was not too excited when I first heard about this album coming out.  The last 2 records were more than a little disappointing (although they have grown on me a bit)...and \"Boxes\" did not sound like the most inspired of album titles either.  Then I see the negative reviews and I was like uh oh.  But being I collect the band...and have every album...even the first 2 funny thrash punk ones in my collection.  Fave album stretch are \"Hold Me Up\", \"Superstar Car Wash\" and \"A Boy Named Goo\"...\"Dizzy\" is great too but severely disappointed me at first, because it seemingly went too mainstream and soft too quickly starting with \"Iris\" and \"Slide\"... too extreme in the wrong direction I thought...but it's how John evolved as a songwriter... and it grew on me as a whole.  Before \"Boxes\", the last Goos album I enjoyed as a whole was \"Let Love In\"... I was afraid \"Boxes\" would be another disappointment...a friend of mine says the haters are wrong cuz the album is great powerpop...and I had a hunch I would enjoy it but needed to hear samples first.  Better yet, they were on TV on Jimmy Kimmel...and they did \"So Alive\"...good tune, best in a while...then they did \"Over & Over\"... that song stopped me in my tracks with that awesomely catchy bullseye Chorus...the key element missing from the last couple of records...which dragged.  Got it today, popped it on...\"Boxes\" has reclaimed their mojo indeed.  Love the tighter songwriting and production, Robby even improved vocally...wish he did more than 2 songs yet again but it's fine.  \"Boxes\" is not better than those early 3...but it doesn't suck and is as good as \"Let Love In\"...so it gives me hope and extended the life of the Goos, so that makes me happy.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Coldplay is in the running for most improved and inventive band of the year. \"Viva La Vida\" has been selected as the song to lead the charge on mainstream radio, and Coldplay expands on their new \"cultured\" sound. Gone are the melodic experiences that were \"Clocks\" and \"Speed of Sound,\" and welcome to the string-based epic of \"Viva La Vida.\" Is the new sound better? While most would say no, I think the song grows on you. And in the end it's nice to have a fine work of art worthy of Da Vinci, rather than the pumpkin carvings of Young Jeezy.\n\nThe sound is as I said a melodic epic with lots of strings. The music goes perfectly with the song, and it seems to hit all the right notes. Structurally, it is equally as brilliant, building to its epic climax complete with choirs and bells. Chris Martin can only add to the song with his ever-melodic vocals, which have never sounded better. You have to admit, Gwynth Paltrow and Chris Martin have only gotten better in their work, and they have seemed to hit new highs this summer.\n\nLyrically, it undeniably has a lot of Christian imagery, which would make sense since he's Catholic. But the overall meaning could be a myriad of things. But in either case, the lyrics, the music, the vocals, the atmosphere, all mesh together in one glorious tune. And amazingly, the song comes out a bit catchy.\n\nOverall, Coldplay's best? It's epic. It's melodic. It's different. It's brilliant. It's Coldplay. I can't wait to listen to the whole album, but if it's anything like the two I've heard so far, it should be the best album of the past few years. A true work of art in the sea of tranquility. I can only hope it reaches #1 on the Hot 100.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I loved Rob Thomas's first album so much such a bold style and great variety and I was sorely disappointed with the 2nd release.  It seemed like a lazy effort and it was so generic. It had the style but no substance.  But this new album is really a joke, most of it is experimentation way out there trying stuff just to sound different.  This is not going to help his career one bit.  The songs that he does take serious are quite good.  I Think We'd Feel Good Together, Hold On Forever, The Great Unknown, Heaven Help Me, and Pieces.  Five songs that he wrote and took serious which get the two stars.  The other 8 songs are mostly wild experiments trying to reach outside his own space and be something he is not (and should not be).  Those songs lost 3 stars from the rating.  He should have continued and built on the 5 songs and he may have had a great new CD.  The 5 songs I mentioned I liked for the most part much better than the stuff on Cradlesong.  I think it's Rob's wild idea that this techno or new pop sound would land him a hit single or something?  It did not and it won't!","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"I just picked up the deluxe version of the album this morning, and I'm happy I got it. This album is pretty hot. It's not mindblowing, so if you're expecting the hottest album in years, or if you believe the hype that's been building the last two years... you might be disappointed. If you're like me, didn't believe the hype, but looked forward to the album, you'll be pleased no doubt. The album kicks off nice with 3 Peat followed by Mr. Carter, A Milli, Got Money... All hot songs. Dr. Carter is also real dope. I like the concept and everything. Comfortable with Babyface, produced by Kanye West is dope. Tie My Hands featuring Robin Thicke is one of my favorite songs at this point. The guitar and beat are NAASTY. I love it. That should DEF be the next single. Phone Home is... weird lol. The beat is kind hot, but the hook is strange and the lyrics are iffy. Sometimes he's tight, sometimes it's just WEIRD. It's Wayne, you know. Mrs. Officer is cool, not bad. Let the Beat Build is pretty ill. I like how the beat literally builds throughout the songs and the arrangement changes up. Wayne's good on it, but honestly I was paying more attention to the beat at first, so I gotta go back and listen.\n\nI thought towards the end the album started losing steam. La La is aright with Brisco and Busta. Playing With Fire is aright. Dontgetit is good. The deluxe edition that came with the second disc is ill though. If you listen straight through the album, disc 1 to disc 2 (The Leak), it finishes off strong. Some of the best songs on the album like I'm Me, Gossip, Kush, Love Me or Hate Me and Talk About It. I know. They're OLD. Whatever. They're still hot.\n\nI'd reccommend coppin the deluxe edition for real. The regular edition is good and worth coppin too, but including the second disc with material from the Leak makes it great. I did get the full Leak (not just 5 songs) last year, which was DOPE, but I'm still glad I copped Tha Carter III.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"It is amazing that 20 years ago, when AC\/DC released their last live record, they were considered pretty much a spent force when it came to studio albums. I remember reading a review of \"live\" in Kerrang or Metal Hammer, in which the reviewer who gave \"Live\" 5 out of 5, stated that this was the only time now in AC\/DC's career, that he could for see giving the band top marks.\nHow times have changed, with \"Ball Breaker\", \"Stiff upper lip\" & \"Black Ice\" (admittedly this album is a little hit & miss, but it will do), AC\/DC's credibility has gone through the roof, being named checked by everybody as a major influence.\nWhich is why \"River Plate\" is much more than just a nostalgia concert, which is what you would get if it was The Stones or The Who releasing a new live record.\nThe new songs slot in well with the classic tracks(although no songs from \"Ball Breaker\", or \"Stiff upper..\", which is a shame) & the crowd are on fire, even doing harmonics, which I've never heard before at an AC\/DC gig. The band still gives an energetic performance considering their ripe old age.\nLive albums always work better, when there recorded from one venue, instead of a whole tour, constantly fading in & out after each song, losing momentum.  But \"River Plate\" feels like a one off special event, which always makes a live more appearing to listen to. It is interesting that back in the 70's & 80's, rock bands would regularly release a live album every 3-4-studio albums, but \"AC\/DC Live\" was one of the last big selling live albums (Thanks Kirk Cobain).\nNowadays it only really Iron Maiden that do live albums, so it a little difficult to judge \"River Plate\" by contemporary standards, but then again AC\/DC have never concerned themselves with shifting musical fashions.\nThe only nit-pick I have, is that it's a shame AC\/DC didn't record the gig in a small club, like The Stones have been doing in 2012, perhaps that could be the band  next live venture.","classification":5,"fold":2}

For long long time Dylan fans, this is a detour down a side road (another another Self Portrait) much like the Good As I Been To You years.  It is understandable that some newer fans may not like this, but if you don't, you should listen to it.  Great care was put into the making of this album-it is NOT a throwaway.  This is the best Dylan has sung in years, and the performance is tremendous:  If you don't think so, YOU TRY IT!  Artists like Dylan, Neil Young, and Van Morrison will venture down low maintenance back roads that lesser artists would not risk taking for fear of offending fans and record companies.

{"text":"As with many of the reviewers, I got this as a \"freebie\" from Amazon (thank you, Amazon, for introducing me to a lot of new music!).  The guitar and rock beat are very typical. The vocals are good, but not exceptional. I think it's the lyrics that make this song a piece of art. It's a story that is open enough that the listener can draw their own conclusion as to the real meaning and ending to the story. It's edgy and takes a chance. Not bad, but I don't know that I would pay for a closer listen to a whole album.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Only for diehard fans of the late grunge group Nirvana would this album since it includes an unreleased track called You Know Your Right which was the last track record by the group before Kurt's suicide in 1994. For only having 14 songs it should of had more like Negative Creep, Slappy, Scentless Apprentice, Drain You, Polly. The rest of the tracks on the album like In Bloom, Smells like teen spirit, Lithium, Rape me, Heartshape Box, About a girl, Been a son, all apologizes, the man who sold the world, pennyroyal tea can be found in Beach, Nevermind, and In Utero plus Unplugged album. There is no need for this album unless you want almost all of the hits with a few missing. It looks like Dave, Courtney, and Chris were just looking for a quick cash in and just throw this collection whoever did, I think it was Courtney mostly. It should of had videos or interview with Dave, Chris and former members of the band talking about Nirvana or at least live footage of the band.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"I have always been a fan of Jason Isbell. Having said that, \"Southeastern\" was still astonishing to me. A favorite roots rocker suddenly became one of my favorite songwriters of all time. I worried about a followup to something that meant so much to me. As it turns out, I didn't have to be. Producer Dave Cobb, the 400 Unit and violinist wife Amanda Shires are back and \"Something More Than Free\" is a subtler, slightly quieter album with a smaller casualty rate. If \"Southeastern\" was the transition to sobriety and an assessment of his former life, the new album is an expectant father looking forward and living and enjoying his life. Isbell doesn't just write songs, he writes short stories and he's working on a higher plane than most recording artists could even aspire to.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I know most of us have heard her rendition of \"And I'm Telling You\" and while this is included on her debut effort.  I found other tracks on the cd to be as noteworthy if not more.  The first single, \"Spotlight\" for one which she sings of her man loving her a bit too much.  Always possessive and smothering, it's a nice debut single of her own.  It's true she didn't have a lot of say as far as the writing and producing songs.\n\nBut i believe that will come with time and more experience in the music business.  I look forward to that but as for her cd now.  It's a solid interpretation of her tastes and different styles with songs like \"If This Isn't Love\" or the sassy and spirited \"Pocketbook\" w\/Ludacris (who brings his A-game on this song).  Also of note are the songs \"My Heart\", \"I'm His Only Woman\" w\/(fellow AI alum) Fantasia that has them both sparring for the title of the only woman in this guys life.\n\nI also found myself enjoying the songs \"We Gon' Fight\" and \"Invisible\" as showing other sides of Jennifer Hudson's abundant talent and with more time and experience.  I only see her taking more control of her career and more involved in all aspects.  Her debut, self-titled album however shows a lot of promise and more than enough variety to keep fans satisfied.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"This is a unique song because one of the lines is \"this is not rap, this is not hip-hop\" even though it sounds like it. It's a song about the singer getting out the things he wants to say.

But that strength has been weakened with his latest single which also was featured on the likeness from the Jersey Shore fan base with I Like It, from his latest album Euphoria. I really felt that it just was him trying to prove his dance beats to a new generation of fans was one step too far. It just was just as lackluster as his last album, 7 had shown in his voice.

{"text":"Though I've only discovered Bad Religion about a year ago, they've quickly moved up to being one of my favorite bands. What I like about them the most is that their CDs almost all have their own sound to them; all sound different, and all have great songs on them. With the exception of Recipe for Hate (which I just can't get into) they've never made a CD I haven't liked. This CD, too, has its own distinct sound.\n\nThis CD actually reminds me a lot of New America. Not that it sounds anything like New America, but both of these CD favor very melodic songs over songs that people would consider \"fast.\" Granted, Dissent of Man has several fast, old-school style Bad Religion songs, (Most written by Greg Graffin, while a majority of Brett Gurewitz's songs are slower and a little more accoustic) but a lot of this CD finds the band at probably the most melodic I've ever heard them. Songs like Pride and the Pallor and the Devil in Stitches are almost unbelievably catchy.\n\nThere are definitely great songs on here. The Resist Stance, The Wrong Way Kids, The Devil in Stitches, Only Rain, the Pride and the Pallor, Avalon...great stuff. Ad Hominem is really the only track on here that I don't like.\n\nI just wish it were all a bit faster and more energetic. Sort of reminiscent of New America, I find it a little more challenging to listen to the full CD in one nonstop session than many of the band's other works, mainly because of the slower, more melodic pace. The problem with Dissent of Man is that the CD gets off to a pretty fast start, but at the end literally grinds to a crawl as the last 5 songs are all slower, reminiscent of New America's Whisper in Time and There Will Be a Way. Again, not bad songs at all, and I love I Won't Say Anything. But the pacing of the album is definitely slowed by this ending block of songs, which I think could have been spread out more throughout the CD.\n\nMy original review of The Dissent of Man was pretty vague, mainly because I wasn't sure what I thought of it. The CD has grown on me a lot more over time, and like New America, it's enjoyable and melodic, but also like New America, I just don't necessarily think it stands at the top of Bad Religion's library.","classification":4,"fold":2}

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

{"text":"I don't know about anyone else, but for a die-hard comic geek like me, seeing a Jonah Hex movie is a bit of a strange thing.  Regardless, here we are with Josh Brolin no less playing the scarred bounty hunter, and John Malkovich playing his nemesis Turnbull.  The surprising production values and the even more surprisingly noteworthy cast of actors could have really combined to make Jonah Hex a worthwhile comic adaptation, but sadly, the end result isn't anything really worth writing home about, albeit the film itself is not nearly as terrible as early teasers and its poor box office had suggested.  Hex is on Turnbull's tail as the villain plans to watch America burn in flames during its centennial event, with Hex's partner being that of a prostitute (Megan Fox, because they figured eye candy would be better than Hex's male comic ally Batlash).  A majority of the action scenes are shallow, not to mention the violence of which and authenticity of the old west are just watered down to comply with the PG-13 rating.  Still, Brolin is decent enough as Hex (and the prosthetic makeup isn't bad either), Malkovich mails it in, Fox's brief role is nothing more than said eye-candy, and even other actors such as Will Arnett, Aidan Quinn, Lance Reddick, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in an uncredited cameo don't seem to have too much interest in the proceedings.  Michael Fassbender (Inglourious Basterds and soon to be seen as the young Magneto in the X-Men prequel) isn't bad as Turnbull's irish, tattooed henchman, but that's pretty much it.  All in all, Jonah Hex is a brisk endeavor that isn't nearly as bad as one would think, but as said before, there isn't a whole lot to admire here either.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"Bad news first: \"You Don't Love Me\" is a disappointment, and a big one at that. I understand you can't expect a bunch of guys who are a combined twenty billion hundred million thousand whatever years old at that point to, in the immortal words of either Franz Kafka or George Clinton (not sure which one), \"tear the roof off the sucker\" like they used to do back in \"the day\" (no, not that day, the other day), but it's still kind of stoic and boring. Now, the good news: everything else is far better. Especially when the group just jams - \"Back Where It All Begins\", for instance, might even be better than the studio version. And you know how they always slightly vary \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" when they play it live? Well, here's it's all acoustic! And it's sweet! Especially when it comes to the soloing. Now, here's a proposal for a bill that should be signed into federal law: all bands must record and release at least one song with an acoustic guitar solo. Hey, I'd vote for it. Oh, and there's a bass solo! I mean, how cool is that? And \"The Same Thing\" has some fantastic heavy blues licks - it's about the heaviest the group has ever gotten, in fact. Their Bo Diddley tribute \"Nobody to Run with\" (one of the four songs from Where It All Begins, along with \"Back Where It All Begins\", \"Soulshine\" and \"Sailin' 'Cross the Devil's Sea\" - all three are awesome) is good fun, as it was on the studio version. And they save (arguably) the best for last with \"Jessica\", with some slight shifts in tempo that give it an epic feel, as well as the usual great guitars that this incarnation of the band has in spades. It won a Grammy, and I understand why. It might even be better than the classic original. But that's a tough call. Oh, and look for the \"There Is a Mountain\" quote. Think they were feeling nostalgic? This is by far the best of the two \"Evening With\" sets, though both are fantastic - it easily ranks up there with the classic live albums of yore.","classification":5,"fold":2}

If you have to pretend it's not Yes, go ahead. But give it a listen. This album could have been called \"Drama Phase Two\". In all honesty I can say that musically this album blows \"Keystudio\", \"Open Your Eyes\", \"The Ladder\" and \"Magnification\" out of the water. And I truly love all of those (except \"Open Your Eyes\"). It's been about 2 years since \"FFH\" came out and I first heard it. This album is strong enough to stand up proud among the other albums in the Yes canon. At first I thought it was foolish to attempt to reconstruct the leftover \"Drama\" track \"Fly From Here\", but it works. They did a great job on this. Expanded to epic proportions without it sounding like they just made it long on purpose. Not a bad track on here. My favorite is \"Into The Storm\". I say good luck to anyone who keeps Yes moving into the future. I will listen...And R.I.P., Peter Banks.","classification":4,"fold":2}

As with any performer of Bowie's stature, there are obviously some tracks that are missing like \"Suffragette City,\" \"Cracked Actor,\" \"DJ\" and a few others). I also prefer album tracks to single mixes, because if it's a song I care about (like \"Heroes\"), I pretty much have the original version memorized start-to-finish. But those are all minor quibbles.

{"text":"I've been listening to this disc since it came out a few days ago - I find it a wonderful, melodic, and mature work - distinctly from the Pet Shop Boys. Andrew Sullivan, in his brilliant socio-political blog The Dish turned me on to PSB several years ago. Since that time, I've purchased virtually every disc they have released, and built up quite a PSB library. I print his recent comments\/review of Elysium in its entirety. Sully nails it:\n\n\"I've been listening to Elysium for a few days now. It's a dreamy meditation on life and death and time. The track Invisible is technically peerless and emotionally wrenching, if you're headed into middle age. The lyrics to \"Your Early Stuff\" are hilarious, if you've ever had a long career in something. The LA lounge-sound is both new and yet very PSB.\n\nBut the song above, \"Leaving,\" has really stayed with me. It couples with \"Breathing Space\" for me as the highlight of the album. Maybe it's the time of year as the Cape light intensifies and the beaches empty and the dusk turns the tide into purple lava, and shops empty and restaurants close and \"leaving\" looms. Maybe it's because we're also leaving DC for the coming year to try living in New York City (for Aaron's career and my proximity to the Beast and the Dish team). But the melancholy and hope of autumn find an elegant, calming balance in this latest album. It has made me suddenly very sad at times as I bike through the dunes listening; and also, for longer periods, oddly joyous.\n\nMost of all, the atmosphere of the album felt like home - this little home on my romanticized, elysian sandbar I return to and won't leave summer after summer, reaching forward for something I will never grasp, escaping somewhere for nowhere, wading in the tidal pools and watching the sun change the colors around me and feeling the moon pull the water past me:\n\nThere's a place beyond this world\nWhere the mountains meet the sky\nIt's a different state of mind\nLike a dream where you can fly\n\nCan I tell you this in confidence?\nI need to regain that old innocence\nI stop for some breathing space\nDivert from the public place\nReturn to a private place\nI know it's there just in case\nI gotta get out\nI gotta get out\n\nAnd now I must leave.\"","classification":4,"fold":2}

Back in the days when rock music was fun, melodic, and not bogged down with angst and pretension.\n\nThis album sounds as if it could have been recorded in 1988, and from the moment you hear \"21 Till I Die,\" it brings back a warm feeling of nostalgia. Other highlights include \"Blame It On Love\" and \"Rock and A Hard Place,\" which is vintage Hysteria-era Def Leppard. Nearly all of the tracks are excellent. What's even better is the fact that the band does not sound as if they are trying too hard. They sound like they are having a great time, and so will you during this listening experience.\n\nAn album like this will come along every so often and remind us just how good this type of music can sound when it is done right. \"Crazy Lixx\" has put a big grin on my face, as it has restored my faith in sensible, melodic hard rock once again, and brought me back to a time in my life when music was exciting.","classification":5,"fold":2}

It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.

Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.\n\nIn the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Sure, before you could buy the pricey imports, but \"The Essential Cyndi Lauper\" is much better than her previous American \"hits\" collections. It's not perfect, yet I think it's superior to \"12 Deadly Cyns.\"\nThe big complaint was that for so long, american fans couldn't get \"Good Enough\" from \"The goonies.\" Well, FINALLY it's included. Whether or not Cyndi likes the song, it's an 80's movie song classic and was a top 10 hit. Eight of Cyndi's top 10 hits are on here including the classic \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", \"She Bop\", \"All Through the Night\" and \"Time After Time\" frm her debut. all four of these were massive radio hits and still heard to this day. \"True Colors\" and \"Change of Heart\" were big hits off of her sophomore album. Her last top 10 single is included too from \"A Night to Remember\" which is \"I Drove All Night\" *recently Celine Dion did an amazing cover of it.* \"Money Changes Everything\" is graciously included also which didn't hit the top 10, but was still a big top 40 hit. The non-hits are also very worthy. \"Hat Full of Stars\" is gorgeous and \"Sisters of Avalon\" is very catchy.\nSo why 4 stars? As outstanding as this collection is, \"What's Going On\" *a top 10 hit from \"True Colors\"* was left off as was the minor hit \"Hole In My Heart.\" These are minor gripes but would've really put it over the top. Still, it's a great hits collection and well worth the money. Cyndi is awesome.","classification":4,"fold":2}

I've been hear only the stanniest of Drake stans praise this album as some transcending genre-bending album, but all it is is a terribly mediocre, formulaic, water-down version of Take Care. It's almost embarrassing to even listen to. There's literally 4 tracks...4....FOUR tracks worth anything. Views, 9, Faithful, and......wow, I can't even think of the other song, that's how forgettable this album is, that even the good tracks aren't even all that. The rest of the album is filled with corny haiku-like ballads, reggae riddims that would sound better if they weren't so forced, and overall WEAK production. Drake should be embarrassed for feeding this album to his fans, and the worst part about it is they all eat it up and shoot it to the top of the charts, forcing upcoming artists to attempt to make the same type of garbage he put on on here. This HAS to be the least replay value worth album in Drake's entire catalog, which is a shame for such a popular artist.","classification":1,"fold":2}

Can you imagine a song like this being sung by anybody else?\n\nThis song is about what girl the singer wants, and it's a rather long list, and like a child's Christmas list, it starts off general and reasonable, but by the end it gets very specific, \"She's changing her name\/From Kitty to Karen\/She's trading her MG\/For a white Chrysler LeBaron\/I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket.\" And when the song gets to the Na Na Na Na Na part, then you're instantly hooked, dancing, and singing. This song is amazingly catchy, and brilliant. You won't hear lyrics like these from Beyonce, or anybody else, except for Weird Al.\n\nOverall, a great song that shine with its subtle poise, humor, wit and brilliance. This is a excellent song not only for Cake, but for music in general. And to this day, nobody has made anything like it...","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Appropriate for Intermediate or beginner level meditation or just to use as a relaxer.  Some might like it as it is a nice piece but contained way to much obviously contrived \"music\" in an attempt to lead one's thoughts.  Composed by someone who does not seriously understand what meditation needs.  Suggestive little \"ditties\" in an endless chain does not make for or assist meditation, on the contrary it is actuality a hindrance.  Meditation is a journey to endless personal simplification. Motionless, silent, unhindered, unending, evolving inner space where love, compassion and understanding permeate.  The second piece with passive waves and resonant tones would have been much better except for the interjection of vocals that are identifiable as a human mostly female voice.  In places the voice is almost acceptable but for most of the time it has to much personality and attitude.  The brain wave sync track is great.  The heavy breathing is ridiculous and distracting.  It does a fair job as introductory mind control music and is very relaxing.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"It's been a long, wild ride for Ann and Nancy Wilson. From one of the premiere female-fronted bands of all time to video vixens...being dropped by not one label, but two, after selling millions of records....a few fallow years, followed by a rip-roaring comeback over the last decade....yes, it's been a crazy journey for Heart.\n  Said journey continues with the band's fourteenth studio album, FANATIC. While not as instantly accessable as 2004's JUPITER'S DARLING, but much more creatively challenging than 2010's RED VELVET CAR, FANATIC is one of those releases that kind of creeps up on you, revealing new and wonderous things with each successive listen.\n  Granted, I'm not sure Ben Mink is the right producer for the band ~ he tends to pull the sisters apart, vs. uniting them ~ and I still think the Wilson's are squandering their greatest asset (a natural, innate gift of harmony that only comes from years of siblings singing together), but there's enough magic here to make the disc a welcomed addition to the Heart catalog.\n  Things start strongly with the disc's rollicking title track. Ann's meaty lead vocal is perfectly anchored by surging guitars, thundering drums, clever percussion and Mink's \"programming\/sonic mangling.\" Granted, the lyrics are a little...hollow..but, overall, a decent way to kick things off.\n  \"Dear Old America\" is a prime example of what Heart does best...blending two sounds\/styles (violas and violins, hard rock) and making it work. But it's also exemplary of one of FANATIC's biggest faults...the over-the-top guitar bridge seems forced and calculated, almost tossed in to prove the Wilson's can still ROCK. We know they can....they've got nothing to prove. Still, another strong cut.\n  Tracks three and four are the album's best cuts, albeit with a minor glitch. \"Walkin' Good\" is a mid-tempo rocker blessed with an easy-going arrangement, Nancy's lovely lead vocal and heartfelt lyrics (\"Living in my ordinary shoes\/Walking off my ordinary blues\"). But why bring in Sarah McLachlan to do the co-lead vocal? This would have been the PERFECT opportunity for the sisters to really let loose together. A really, really, REALLY good song that could have been a GREAT one!\n  The key element to \"Skin And Bones\" is it's attitude...this track proves that rock & roll is all about attitude, and attitude often mirrors heart (no pun intended!). With said attitude, it doesn't matter how loud you are...Ann's subdued, sultry lead vocal has just as much power as on some of the ones where she's wailing. Absolute perfection.\n  On the flipside, \"A Million Miles\" is one of the few tracks that just doesn't work for me....it feels rehashed and shallow, as if (as I said earlier) the band is trying to prove that they can still RAWK, MAN!!! I suspect the song might work better live, but the recorded version is one of FANATIC's few misfires.\n  There's a dreamy, atmospheric quality to \"Pennsylvania\" that's absolutely captivating. An earthy, yet gutsy, arrangement, a stunning lead vocal from Ann, angelic backing vocals and vividly picturesque lyrics (\"A bell is ringing in the courthouse square\/Rusted angels floating everywhere\/St. Michael singing to the spirits passing by\") all meld together brilliantly, resulting in one of the disc's finest moments. Just lovely.\n  The less said about \"Mashallah!\", the better. This song is just loud, bloated and over the top. It's not proving anything...quite the opposite....it's making the band look desperate. FANATIC's biggest misstep.\n  The only way to describe \"Rock Deep\" is to call it a power ballad, albeit without that wailing vocal that usually came with the second or third verse that dominated said genre back in the 80's. Here, Ann's subdued (yet strong) vocal is perfectly augmented by Nancy's delicate backing vocals and simple, yet elegant, instrumentation. The feel may be a softer one, but the overall vibe rocks as hard as any other track on the album. Very nice.\n  \"59 Crunch\" is both a hit...and a miss. It is SO good hearing the sisters trade off vocals ~ more, please! ~ but the lyrics are just nonsensical gibberish. I can only imagine the true gem that would have resulted had these vocals been put on a REAL song! So, SO close!\n  The standard disc wraps up with \"Corduroy Road.\" Atmospheric, hypnotic, other-worldly, the song finds the Wilson's stretching in a way they haven't in a long time....and they TOTALLY succeed. Mandolins, strings, layered vocals...it's all magical, and it all works, absolutely. Lovely.\n Now, two of the three tracks on the extended disc are worth having, but only for, say, $15.00 or less. The first track, \"Beautiful Broken\", is pretty much a generic throwaway, boardering on cliched. Still, there's a nice energy to it. An O.K. cut.\n  Far better are \"Two Silver Rings\", which is really just lovely poetry set to music (\"They're traveling as they've always traveled\/By night wrapped in silk\/Colors woven by the moon\/The children sleeping in the cool\/Whispers of movement\") and \"Zingara\", a seductive off-shoot of \"Corduroy Road\" that sports one of Nancy's best lead vocals to date. (If \"Two Silver Rings\" and \"Zingara\" had replaced \"A Million Miles\" and \"Mashalla!\" on the standard disc, this would have been a five star album).\n  So where do the Wilson sisters and Heart go from here? Well, A) I'd like to see them work with a new producer (maybe T-Bone Burnett, Rick Rubin or Matt Serletic), B) know they have nothing to prove, and C) TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE HARMONIES!!! FANATIC is strong....but I want to be head-over-heels crazy about their next release! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics, but I'm also docking it half a star for only offering the extended version through one retailer).","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I'm not really familiar with MacFarlane's biggest claims to fame--I don't really watch Family Guy, although I have seen a few episodes.  I'm not even certain what made me pop this CD in the player--but boy am I glad that I did!  I love big band music, love the rat pack, love the 40's and 50's style of music.  This CD is a wonderful homage to that era; the orchestra is crisp, exciting with drenchingly melodic strings, playful flutes, and an elegant tempo throughout.  But the real winner is Seth's voice!  It is warm, warm, warm--like a wonderful thick robe you put on while sitting by the fire.  His tone recalls Sinatra without being overly derivative, and his technique is marvellous--vibrato right on key.  Melody is king here, beautiful melodies, wonderfully sung.  This album has instantly earned itself a place next to some of my favorite big band\/crooner albums, and will fit alongside them without irony.  A delight, really a delight, and I am sitting here with a giant smile on my face listening to this record.  Pick it up if you love Sinatra, Dino, and the guys, and give it a spin.

{"text":"(Courtesy of Amazon Prime Music)\nFive SCINTILLATING Stars. In 1963, multiple Academy Award and multiple Grammy award-winning composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader Henry Mancini composed the triple-Grammy winning and Academy Award-nominated \"The Pink Panther Theme\" for the eponymously-entitled comedic-heist motion picture co-written and directed by long-time Mancini associate Blake Edwards. The music was coordinated with the movement of the animated pink panther cartoon character in the opening credits and has been used in some of the 11 follow-on Pink Panther movies over 30 years. It is so closely associated with Peter Sellers who starred as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, though he only starred in about four of the movies.\n\nThe memorable Mancini musical theme was played by an orchestra made up of many of the same studio musicians associated with some of Mancini's greatest musical triumphs such as \"Peter Gunn\" and \"Mr Lucky\". Plas Johnson plays the widely-acclaimed tenor sax solo which conveys elegance, hipness, and musical buoyancy in a memorable performance. In addition, other Mancini stalwarts include Pete Candoli on trumpet, Dick Nash on trombone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Shelly Manne on drums, Larry Bunker on vibes, Bob Bain on guitar, and Ted Nash and Ronny Lang on saxophones. The thrill of the performance beyond Johnson's key tenor sax role in stating the theme and performing the solo, include hot unison saxophone section riffs, the unison flute theme statement, unison trumpet section splashes, and key off-kilter pauses that add to the ambiance.

{"text":"I'm in a Weezer mood today. I'm listening to their entire catalog this afternoon and it's not getting old.\n\nI was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)\n\nLooking back on it now, after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so, they really are amazing. They have a distinctive sound that's very alternative but also very much their own. It's also not a hard sound. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy.\n\nAnd it's not an accident that 'Buddy Holly' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album. It's the best song on the album. Yeah it's the one with the most radio play, but that's because it's awesome. 'Susanne' is a close second, mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats. (Which I loved in the 90's but had no idea it was Weezer sining. I told you I was lame.) But 'Susanne' is only available on the deluxe version of the Blue Album. It's not available via the Prime streaming option. If you're buying the album, the Deluxe version is the only way to go. Don't get just the basic version.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"Black or White is one of those songs by Michael Jackson that is memorable not just because of the beat and the video that would later accompany it, but because of the words.\n\nWe live in a time where so much is put on color, but there is something else that I realized when I heard the song recently. Life is not black and white. Nothing is really at its best when it is separated and distilled. Michael Jackson knew that in his career and refused to be defined. We would do ourselves and the world a favor that doing the same.\n\nBlack or White contains a message that minds us that we are all human, all important regardless of what we look like. What matters is how we live and treat our fellowman. If we remember that, then we will truly be able to say we are living life to the fullest.","classification":5,"fold":2}

When I was almost done with my pitch, this song came on. I turned up a little for her to hear it better. She suddenly had tears running down her, sobbing a little. She turned the radio off. She hugged me briefly, kissing me on the cheek. She opened the car door and got out. She turned around and said: \"Thank you. Roger. I won't send this letter. It would be very cruel of me to do that. You see, I was so afraid to lose him. Instead, I will write him to tell him how much I love him and how much I miss him. Then I will hope for the best.

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Still Believe, Healing Oil, Miracle Maker\n\nKim Walker-Smith knows how to keep it trim and lean.  Whilst many contemporary worship acts consummately packaged their records with an overabundance of songs tagged on with a deluxe version bursting with bonus tracks, remixes, acoustic and live versions, this is not the case with Walker-Smith's latest release \"Still Believe.\"  It only has 9 cuts or 8 to be precise (as there is a repeat of \"Spirit Break Out\").  Further, out of the 8 songs, half of them are covers.  Nevertheless, it's still a little more buff up compared to her debut solo record which only had 5 songs proper with the rest of the disc being interludes of spontaneous worship.  Considering such an anorexic of song numbers, is this album worth purchasing?  The short answer is yes.  What you get from \"Still Believe\" is more than just a record.  This is an intense worship experience captured on disc.  As worship leader of Jesus Culture and worship pastor of Bethel Church, Kim Walker-Smith has had caused many youths and young adults to sell out their souls to Jesus.  And this did not happen surreptitiously.  Walker-Smith has a way of using very simple worship songs-often conversational in language without a myriad of theological jargons and mixed metaphors -backed with her explosive voice to lift our hearts' cries to God in honesty and reverence.  Such a simple but Spirit-filled template has stirred up such regenerations among young people that some have even drawn parallels between this and the New England revival of yore.  \"Still Believe,\" Walker-Smith's first solo album in 5 years, is the much anticipated follow-up to her highly successful \"Here is My Song.\"  If you are familiar with the repertoire of Jesus Culture, there are no surprises here.  This is a set of slow burning modern worship ballads of abandonment to God with absolute no detours to issues of secondarily importance.\n\nThe songs here are tied around the theme of a greater desire to see God at work in greater measures through healing, miracles and intervention into our lives.  Walker-Smith has no time for small and lesser things, and this is expressed in her self-penned title cut \"Still Believe.\"  She goes straight to the blood of Christ professing her simple trust in Jesus on \"Still Believe\" before inviting us to join at the altar in worship.  But such only probes the surface of engaging the divine; on the Walker-Smith co-written \"The King Has Come\" this Jesus Culture leader stares at the face of Jesus the Divine Lion as he makes his way step by step towards us.  Starting off slow and taking her time to build and build into a crescendo of magnificent praise, \"The King Has Come\" is so majestic that it is indeed worthy of the King of Kings.  Also, a co-write of Walker-Smith is \"Yield My Heart\"-though it does not has that epic building sensation as the former tracks it's still a soothing heartfelt devotional ballad worthy of worshipping with.\n\nAs few as the tracks are, there are actually four covers.  But lest one dismiss these covers as a exercise of slothfulness, we need to remember that Walker-Smith is a great interpreter of songs.  Let us not forget that she has had one of the most definitive renditions of John Mark McMillan's \"How He Loves\" attracting at least 1.2 million viewers on YouTube.  This time round Walker-Smith has chosen to tackle 4 less familiar covers: the first of which is Chris McClarney's \"Waste It All.\"  Taken from McClarney's \"Defender\" album, Walker-Smith's take is more mainstream pop with a more lushful orchestral backing than the original soft rock version.  But she does perk up to the dance floor with Delirious' catchy burner \"Miracle Maker\" and she teases out with some of the most thoughtful nuances of Tim Hughes' \"Spirit Break Out.\"  But the best among the quartet of covers is Chris Lizotte's \"Healing Oil.\"  Initially recorded by Crystal Lewis on her signature record \"Beauty for Ashes,\" it is the perfect choice for an album that eagerly begs for God's breakthrough.  Though there are echoes of Lewis' nuances still present in Walker-Smith's take she truly hits a new height with the way she lets her soaring soprano ride with the highs and lows of this Spirit-drenched ballad.\n\n\"Still Believe,\" like all of Jesus Culture records, is modern worship at its best.  It is inhibited in its backing, youth in its approach, simple in its language, passionate in its delivery and more importantly it is so contagiously heartfelt that you can't help but warm up in worship too.  \"Still Believe\" is more than a record it's an experience; and one not to be missed.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Allegedly a song cycle that came together after various band members either visited or heard from the areas they grew up, \"The Suburbs\" is Arcade Fire's love-hate letter to nostalgia, decay and growth, growing up and the hazy nostalgia of being young in a small town. It's a pretty good series of songs, and more straight-forward than \"Neon Bible.\"\n\nThere's also a decidedly folkier edge to the music this time around, especially in the title track and the epic \"Sprawl II.\" However, there are still times when the dense rock that built the band's reputation. The punkish \"Ready To Start\" may be the most propulsive song AF has ever recorded, and the ever present Springsteen influence reigns over \"City With No Children.\" The blend of songs is pretty incredible, as fairly soon afterward is the poppish lament of \"Wasted Hours,\" reminiscent of The Band, and the most acerbic lyric of the whole album.\n\n\"The Suburbs\" is a complex and rich album, yet Arcade Fire's most direct. When Wim sadly describes \"kids and buses still waiting to be free,\" it cuts as hard as anything off \"Funeral\" ever did for me. I may find \"Funeral\" to remain their best album, but \"The Suburbs\" is maybe even more universal. One of the year's best.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Beyonce' Knowles, has became more like she has been a product, not a talented diverse soul. The songs on her self-titled record have been so poor, that even the remixes make you want to place ear muffs over her voice. Her remix of Flawless with Nicki Minaj was in response to her sister and Jay-Z's elevator brawl and sadly, the feeling of the song has been more of a defense of her marriage. Sadly, the song already was poorly made, but it doesn't make it any better with age. In fact, it still is a terrible song for her. Worse than the sound Beyonce' had with Diva, or Get Me Bodied. The next time she puts out a remix, she should check her own talent out with it, than throw it away. That is why she became more flawed than flawless.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"Remember that movie, \"10 Things I Hate About You?\" Well, neither do I, probably because I haven't seen it, but along with Sex and The City, Miley Cyrus is apparently a fan of that too. So naturally, such a topic must be converted to song form, but along the way, she lost 3 things, and gained 7 more. The first list is seemingly what the 10 things is, including the 7th thing she hates about her guy is how much she loves him. Who didn't see that coming? She still is a property of Disney after all.\n\nAnyways, to make up for the 7 things she hates, she comes up with 7 things she loves about her lover. Ahhh... How sweet! Sarcastic maybe, but what did you expect. While it is good that she is doing something slightly original, it's not exactly in my realm, but I'm not a girl under 18. So her audience will of course love her and erect alters for her, and bow and worship at her feet. For the rest of us, it actually isn't that bad of a song. Actually, it's good. I wouldn't say pretty good, or great, but just good. Really people, she isn't inventing the wheel.\n\nOverall, happy love pop that will sure to please every Miley fan that's still allowed to listen to her after Sheet-Gate. And as probably Miley's biggest hater, I can say that this song isn't half bad.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Sure, before you could buy the pricey imports, but \"The Essential Cyndi Lauper\" is much better than her previous American \"hits\" collections. It's not perfect, yet I think it's superior to \"12 Deadly Cyns.\"\nThe big complaint was that for so long, american fans couldn't get \"Good Enough\" from \"The goonies.\" Well, FINALLY it's included. Whether or not Cyndi likes the song, it's an 80's movie song classic and was a top 10 hit. Eight of Cyndi's top 10 hits are on here including the classic \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", \"She Bop\", \"All Through the Night\" and \"Time After Time\" frm her debut. all four of these were massive radio hits and still heard to this day. \"True Colors\" and \"Change of Heart\" were big hits off of her sophomore album. Her last top 10 single is included too from \"A Night to Remember\" which is \"I Drove All Night\" *recently Celine Dion did an amazing cover of it.* \"Money Changes Everything\" is graciously included also which didn't hit the top 10, but was still a big top 40 hit. The non-hits are also very worthy. \"Hat Full of Stars\" is gorgeous and \"Sisters of Avalon\" is very catchy.\nSo why 4 stars? As outstanding as this collection is, \"What's Going On\" *a top 10 hit from \"True Colors\"* was left off as was the minor hit \"Hole In My Heart.\" These are minor gripes but would've really put it over the top. Still, it's a great hits collection and well worth the money. Cyndi is awesome.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Let's admit it, the Dixie Chicks haven't made a good album in 8 years, and that's partly because they've only made 1 album. Well, tired of waiting any longer for now insufferable Natalie Maines, 2\/3 of the Dixie Chicks went ahead and have become the Court Yard Hounds. The results are surprisingly decent, and otherwise enough evidence that the Dixie Chicks should just disband. The Court Yard Hounds have been let loose.\n\nHighlights Include:\nThe Coast\nDelight (Something New Under the Sun)\nAin't No Son\nThen Again\n\nSince Maines has been the lead singer for most of the Chicks' history, these two haven't really had a good chance to show their talents. Both of them are great vocalists in their own right, and both of them know the Country genre well enough to adhere, but not fall to the cliches of the genre. They also have a great musical sense to the album, creating a whole other sound apart from the more band atmosphere of the Dixie Chicks. No, this a duo, and as a duo, you'll be sure to find plenty of great harmonies here.\n\nOverall, probably the best Country duo since The Wreckers, Court Yard Hounds is a noticeably seasoned album that knows how to take their music places that other artists in the Country genre simply won't take anymore. So, let the Hounds out of their cage, let them roam free, and enjoy what they have to offer. I have the unfortunate feeling that they're going to be short-lived when Natalie Maines comes back as soon as this summer.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I attended a Greg Brown concert recently.  Bo Ramsey, in addition to being Greg's side man, opened the show and mentioned that he had worked on this album of Iris's which he highly recommended.\n\nStylistically, Iris DeMent is quite different from her husband.  Where GB is deep voiced, political, a touch crude, Iris is girlish, sincere, and quite twangy.  She reminds me of Gillian Welch in that throwback, red-dirt-girl kind of way.  Her voice is so distinctive and a bit of an acquired taste.  As she has gotten older the voice has mellowed.  It is so evocative of rural Arkansas where she was born.  Unlike Greg Brown, you will not find Iris with a pocket full of brand new songs.  Clearly she takes her time, thinks very carefully about what she wants to say and how to say it best.  This album is quite special and echoes the theme of Infamous Angel from 1992: Iris paying tribute to her mom and like a good daughter showing the wisdom of her mother's life lessons.\n\nThe record is truly a family affair.  Bo Ramsey is one of the family.  He is married to Greg's daughter Pieta Brown.  He tours with Greg and Pieta and has worked on everyone's albums.  Pieta gets the photo credits for the album, including the classic cover photo.  The other musicians on this album are not so familiar to me, but I like to imagine they are like family to Iris.  Fittingly, the album is dedicated to Dasha, the Russian-born daughter she and GB adopted several years ago.  I found it quite touching that she thanked Greg \"for never losing faith in me.\"  I imagine the harder battle for this humble and talented woman is not to lose faith in herself.\n\nI found myself unexpectedly moved to tears by Before the Colors Fade.  Another high point:  Mama Was Always Tellin' Her Truth.  But really, there is not a weak song on this album.  Maybe not too surprising if you figure she's been working on this one since her last album 16 years ago.  I plan to spend a lot of time listening to this one.  Iris DeMent has a lot to say and I want to hear every bit of it.\n\nUpdate 9\/9\/13 - It's almost too embarrassing to admit, but I was enjoying this album again over the weekend and really took notice of the piano.  It is so fine.  And that is Iris herself playing that thing.  I am even more blown away than I was initially.  This is a very special album.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The reunion of the \"very tall band\" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, \"On Green Dolphin Street,\" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out \"Bags and Trane.\")\n\nOne caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of \"stereophonic sound\" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly \"canned\" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is a great song.  It is very catchy and upbeat, and it includes some very interesting electronic sound effects.  Overall, the music tends to generate positive feelings in the listener.  (Yeah, I admit it, I was nodding my head to the tempo of the music the very first time I listened to it.)  Simply put, the song just sounds like everyone involved is having a lot of fun.\n\nThat is, the song sounds like a lot of fun until the listener allows the lyrics to fully register in the mind.  It's then that the listener will realize that the words focus on a very serious subject - some of the types of mental disorders afflicting a segment of our population.  The subject is discussed in a very subtle way, by describing the behaviors.  While these serious conditions are being sung about, the peppy music, with the singer who sounds happy, continues.  This generates the feeling that the people who are being described (and perhaps even the listener and\/or society at large) are in a state of denial about how serious their conditions are, and how their conditions are impacting their lives, and the lives of those around them.  The good vibes of the music simply lull the listener into thinking that everything is fine.\n\nWas this song written as a social satire, or as a commentary on the tendency of our society to allow too many people who are in need of mental health treatment to slip through the cracks?  It's hard to tell, and I'm not yet familiar with Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.'s work; however, he has a very nice voice, and I plan to listen to more of his music in the future. Time will tell.

{"text":"Fun fact -- this son almost never got written.  \"Weird\" Al Yankovic's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Straight-Outta-Lynwood\/dp\/B0029TPR1M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Straight Outta Lynwood<\/a>&nbsp;album was originally supposed to feature a different song as its starting track, a parody of James Blunt's \"You're Beautiful\" simply titled \"You're Pitiful.\"  But when Atlantic Records threatened to sue Yankovic if he included said song on his album, he had to write this song at the last minute.  Which is probably why, in the music video for this song, you can see a nerdy version of Yankovic vandalizing Atlantic Records' Wikipedia page with a massive \"YOU SUCK\" banner.  (\"You're Pitiful\" can still be found on YouTube if one is interested in seeing what could have been...)\n\nIn my opinion, while having to scrap a planned song and write another at the last minute couldn't have been fun, the album turned out all the better for it.  \"White and Nerdy\" is one of Yankovic's most memorable parodies in years, and it's become an anthem for geeks and nerds around the world.\n\nNot being a big rap fan, I haven't listened to more than snippets of the original song (\"Ridin'\" by Chamillionaire), but I have to say that Weird Al does a fantastic job on this song.  His rapping is fast-paced and intense without being rendered unintelligible by speed, and his word choices are clever, incorporating some mildly gangster-style slang along with a slew of geeky references, and still manages to rhyme throughout.  That takes some impressive skills.\n\nAnd being a nerd myself, I found myself nodding along to many of the nerdy references in the song, and enjoying it immensely.  Some of the references are a unfortunately a bit dated (such as \"my MySpace page is totally pimped out\"), but given that Weird Al usually tries to make his songs fit the time period they came out in, this is understandable.  And I'm sure many self-proclaimed geeks can identify with, and laugh at, some of the traits described in this song, such as being able to quote the entire \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" movie, debating whether Captain Kirk or Captain Picard was the better Star Trek character, and trouncing everyone else in a trivia contest.  Or maybe that's just me who does all these... XD\n\nA fun and clever song from the master of parody, this is easily one of Weird Al's best songs in recent times.  Even if you aren't much of a rap fan, it's guaranteed to at least make you smile, especially if you're of the geeky persuasion or know someone who is.\n\nAlso, if you get a chance, look up the music video for this song.  It not only brilliantly parodies the \"Ridin'\" music video, but is stuffed full of even more geeky references.  Not to mention a hilarious cameo by Donny Osmond...","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Sometimes simplicity can go a long way. That is why artists like India. Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz. Arie returns after bearing her \"Acoustic Soul\" to the world. She is now ready to take us on a \"Voyage To India\" and it's worth taking.\nAlthough the first track'\"Growth,\" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.\nThe only difference is the first single \"Little Things\" which is a track that, surprisingly, does not have any guitars on it, but its lyrics capture the same granola down-to-earth essence as her debut single \"Video.\"\n\"Talk to Her\" is a run-on song. But Arie's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam \"Slow Down\" and the uplifting folk ditty \"Beautiful Surprise.\"\nConsidering all aspects Arie brings into her craft, one could say that Arie's sound is a cross between Erykah Badu and Tracy Chapman.\nArie's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound. As she has stated in her previous album, her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter.\n\"Get It Together\", a song about maintaining strength when times are rough, captures that with her warm vocals and guitar-lead melody. Then, \"Headed In The Right Direction\" starts out like an '80's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end.\nAll songs aside, Arie shines most on \"Can I Walk With You\" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.\n\"Voyage To India\" then meanders into sharp beats on \"The One\" and \"Complicated Melody,\" which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by \"Good Man\" and the bonus track \"Interested,\" which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.\nThis album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite.\nIt contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like \"Acoustic Soul 2\" rather than a record with its own unique taste.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Tim's music is something he characterizes as \"instrumental pop,\" which reflects influences from new age, rock, popular, and even classical music. Right from the opening track, a blend of distinctive melody and impressive technique is evident. Although the track, entitled \"What Will I Be,\" is barely over 2 minutes long, it feels like a complete composition and exhibits a surprising dynamic range in its brief lifespan. In fact, all but one song out of twelve are under 3:15 in length. This brings the total time of the CD to around 33 minutes - relatively short for a CD, but like a buffet of extremely rich food, small portions are just right. By the end you certainly feel like you've had a very full listening experience, given the intricacy and diversity of Tim's music. Although the piano is the centerpiece of the album, lush orchestration tastefully compliments the compositions. Synthesizers and samplers add the sound of strings and woodwinds, while the acoustic guitar of Rick Henley provides accompaniment on some songs.\n\nNeo-classical and rock influences combine on \"Awaken The Dawn,\" in a virtuoso high velocity piece that brought to mind the keyboard wizardry of progressive rockers like Rick Wakeman of Yes, and Keith Emerson from Emerson Lake and Palmer. A nice contrast to this style is a tune called \"Hopefaith,\" which showcases the more gentle side of Tim's playing, yet also exhibits his dynamic range within the boundaries of a song. I was impressed with Tim's abilities as a composer and arranger, as well as with how much detail and complexity he was able to imbue in some of his relatively compact compositions. A song entitled \"Hide And Seek\" is built on a simple descending motif, providing a platform for lavish orchestration to add to the cinematic air. I appreciated that Tim chose to end the album with one of his most sensitive compositions, \"Stratford Road.\" This was the perfect one to provide closure after a CD's worth of intricate, and often intense piano virtuosity. This piece had a pleasant pastoral quality that I found emotionally evocative. In general, the music on this album lends itself more to active listening, than background ambience. Timothy Crane has crafted a spirited mlange of diverse ingredients and influences in the music of \"Pianoforte.\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n \"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\n Un-break my heart\n Say you'll love me again\n Undo this hurt you caused\n When you walked out the door\n And walked out of my life\n Un-cry this tears\n I cried so many, many nights\n Un-break my\n Un-break my heart oh baby\n Come back and say you love me\n Un-break my heart\n Sweet darlin'\n Without you I just can't go on\n Can't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

With Michael it is hard to choose a favorite.  I know I love all his music.  I was saddened beyond words by his death. I truly believe he had many more years of songwriting and singing to offer.  It was obvious that is what he loved to do, and he tried to give to us all through his magic with music and dance.  You are sorely missed Michael.\n\nRecommendations:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Thriller-25th-Anniversary-Edition\/dp\/B000WS4QJG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Thriller, 25th Anniversary Edition<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Essential-Michael-Jackson\/dp\/B0009XNUK0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Essential Michael Jackson<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Michael-Jackson-This-Is-It\/dp\/B002TYZKIM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Michael Jackson: This Is It<\/a>.\n\nCA Luster","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"A brand new 40 year old album!\n\nIf you're not aware of what this album is, it's studio sessions Elvis recorded at his home in 1976 in the home studio he dubbed \"The Jungle Room\". He was trying out some new things in an attempt to stay ahead of the musical curve rather than trying to make a single cohesive album. So there is a wide variety of sounds here. Not all of the songs were new in 1976, nor were all these songs new to Elvis in 1976, but these are 1976 versions of them. Much of this has been previously released (but not all of it, and some of it in different formats or versions) but this version has been completely remastered so it sounds like you are there in the Jungle Room with him.\n\nDespite it being a wide variety of sounds, its unmistakably all 100% Elvis Presley.\n\nThe first 16 tracks are normal studio session songs ready for an album. The rest of the tracks are outtakes and test tracks and such.\n\n Way Down - This is the last single released by Elvis in 1977. It was released the month before he died. This is an upbeat southern jazzy sound with a lot of energy. There is the full band that Elvis always made great use of, female backup singers adding a gospel type sound that Elvis personally LOVED. And of course, the voice of rock and roll itself on lead vocals.\n\n She Thinks I Still Care - This is more of Elvis' original style from the 1950s with soft vocals. It's more of a country music band style behind him that his earlier career. But then again this is very famous country song written by Steve Duffy and Dickey Lee and made famous by George Jones. And then everyone else in country music recorded it as well. Elvis makes it his.\n\n Bitt They Are, Harder They Fall - This is not a gospel song, but it has a similar sound to Elvis' early career gospel music. It was written by Larry Gatlin (Of The Gatlin Brothers) who himself was a gospel singer and songwriter. It's actually a regret song about a relationship falling apart. It's very sad. But somehow when Elvis does it it makes you happy because....Elvis.\n\n Pledging My Love - This one has a very 1950's rock and roll sound to it. It's a 1954 blues song that's been recorded in a variety of ways by everyone and their mother right up until the modern era. This version is reminiscent of classic early Elvis. It also reminds you how Elvis took over the music industry around that time and made everyone else look simple.\n\n For The Heart - He does all kinds of stuff here. There is a country sound mixed with an early 1970's synthesizer. (Those didn't work well until the 80's) There is a steel guitar in there. The problem with this track is that Elvis' voice is a lower volume than the band. So the heart of the song is overpowered by an odd mix of music. It's the one I didn't love. The Judds later recorded this as well.\n\n Love Coming Down - The man could sing the phone book and you'd listen. As soon as Elvis starts on this song you're in love with it. It's Elvis with his gospel style sound (not a gospel song) and full harmonic vocal back ups behind him. I'm not familiar with other versions of this. There may be some, but I don't know them. And quite frankly I'm too lazy to research it.\n\n He'll Have To Go - This is a Jim Reeves classic. Elvis doesn't change the sound of it much except for the vocals. And of course, when Elvis sings it, it becomes his own. This is a song written in 1959 that Elvis recorded in 1976. The Elvis version has been released before and you've probably heard it 100 times. But it sounds brand new here. This track is a shining example of how good the remastering is on this album.\n\n Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain - It's widely believes that this was the last song Elvis Aaron Presley ever sang. (Not this recording. But the song itself. It was one of his personal favorites and he sang it at home to friends and family. This was apparently the last song he sung while sitting at home on August 16, 1977. He passed away later that day.) My favorite version of this song is by Willie Nelson. This version sounds absolutely nothing like Willie Nelson's version. And it's still amazing.\n\n Hurt - This is not the same Hurt that Johnny Cash covered near the end of his life. This is the 1954 song that was a Billboard top hit in multiple categories for Elvis when he covered and released it in 1977. It's a classic example of Elvis' late career from the shows with the sequins and capes and such.\n\n Never Again - This is a song written by Billy Wheeler, who wrote some classic songs, including \"Jackson\" for Johnny Cash. (Among other things) This song is a slow ballad that sounds amazingly Elvis.\n\n Danny Boy - Written in 1910 and sung by every human being alive over the last 106 years, this version is the best one. Elvis Presley's rendition of Danny Boy is the gold standard for this song. My wife thinks it's Harry Connick Jr's version. But she's wrong. This it is. Connick's version is great. Elvis' version will make shamrocks grow.\n\n Solitaire - Neil Sedaka originally wrote and recorded this. The Carpenters made it famous. Elvis makes it awesome. (And I like the Carpenters version) It's a slow ballad and just plays well to Elvis' ability to belt out power notes better than Karen Carpenter could.\n\n Moody Blue - This is obviously the title track of his Moody Blue album, the final full studio album Elvis released. It's a poppy country sound (1976 style). It never really stood on it's own as a single but the album by the same name soared on the charts after Elvis died within the year. Personally I think this song is underrated. I love it.\n\n It's Easy For You - Here's a fun fact, this was written by Braodway super producer Andrew Lloyd Webber. (He did some plays you may have heard of like Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Evita....) It's very piano heavy, more than most Elvis song. But again...written by the guy who gave us music form Phantom of the Opera. So there is a theme here.\n\n I'll Never Fall In Love Again - Originally written by Lonnie Donegan and Jimmy Currie in 1962, this became a hit when Tom Jones redid it in 1967. Elvis did it in 1976. Guess which one was the best version? Go ahead...guess....\n\n The Last Farewell - Roger Whittaker wrote this song in 1971. Elvis recorded it in 1976. It's a story ballad about sailing a ship into battle. That is a departure from the style you're used to from Elvis. He takes a softer approach to the vocals on this one. Of course it's still awesome because it's his voice.\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe rest of the tracks include alternate takes of the songs above. What gets included on these is the discussion about the songs before and after each one where Elvis is talking to the band or to the producer or just making jokes. You get a look into Elvis' human side listening to these extras.\n\nThese aren't always as cleaned up as the versions on the first 16 tracks. There is some static and background noise at times. But these aren't studio releases. These make you feel like you're just sitting around Elvis' house listening to him jam with his band. It's a completely different look at The King.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This Is The Definitive Expanded Edition!\n  -------------------------------------------------------------\n  Once again, The Grateful Dead have scored another blockbuster hit in 1974 when\n  they released their next masterpiece, where it was met with critical praise and brought\n  them back to the top of the rock charts.  Showcasing the bands fascinating trademark\n  brand of high-pitched improvisational artistry and free-spirited rock and roll, From The\n  Mars Hotel gives us a stylish serendipity listening experience with wonderful solos, as\n  the band members allow themselves to shine as Phil Lesh provides tender solos over\n  piano-based arrangements, while he bridges the slick guitar & drum solos which Jerry\n  Garcia and Mickey Hart showcase with their style and utmost skill.  Headed by a solid\n  track set that starts with the piano-rocking U.S. Blues, which is done with tongue-and-\n  cheek style, it is well-proceeded by the emotionally sincere folk- rock song China Doll,\n  the funk-oriented Scarlet Begonias, Pride Of Cucamonga and Unbroken Heart (which\n  the latter track serves as the albums centerpiece), as the entire recording brings The\n  Dead back to their original creative vanguard. Highlighted with its breathtaking album\n  cover that features the artwork of a rundown hotel located on the Red Planet billed as\n  The Mars Hotel (yes, such a hotel does exist in San Francisco, which happen to be a\n  flophouse), The Dead have turned out another landmark rock classic that even hit the\n  Top 20 pop album charts, which truly ranks as one of their greatest and most popular\n  achievements. Now digitally-remastered in its own expanded format, From The Mars\n  Hotel sounds 100% perfect as it feature seven bonus tracks including live versions of\n  Wave That Flag, Scarlet Begonias and their excellent version on Chuck Berrys Let It\n  Rock, as well as acoustic demo takes on Pride Of Cucamonga and Loose Lucy, until\n  ending with an alternate take on Unbroken Heart, where it gives this one the finishing\n  touch it deserves, which make this rock and roll classic a timeless work of everlasting\n  art that will shine for the ages and perhaps well beyond infinity.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Recorded when he was 19 years old, we have waited for these tracks but as he continues on his journey, looking forward to another album as a 21 year old; Jonathan & his voice are such a gift!","classification":5,"fold":2}

I was intrigued by the song Rebound which not only is the most explicit song on the cd but also eerily familiar.  I listened and listened and then it came to me: Dilana who I absolutely love and who should have won Supernova some years back but instead was runner-up has a song that sounds very much the same in both beat and vocal on her earliest release, could just be a coincidence.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Invasion was my personal fave 'sound' and this is THAT to a T. b. Pearcy is just dripping with Rattness.. his ratty, raspy drawl is in overdrive!! c. it's $7.99 for a download:)\n\nI could go through a track by track for you but suffice it say there are only 1 or 2 songs that didn't grab me -- Lost Weekend being one of them -- the rest is classic Ratt 2010..\n\nWith Infestation it's hard to even have a fave song -- they are generally all so instantly Ratt-esque and like-able. We miss you King but the fella's really made a winner here, much, much better than the previous Ratt self-titled effort.

{"text":"When Rick Ross first bowed with \"Hustlin'\", I was an instant fan.  But when his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Port-of-Miami\/dp\/B000FZET70\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Port of Miami<\/a>&nbsp;materialized, I was less enthusiastic - Ross's flow was incredibly sluggish and the material came over to me as sub-par.  At the time, I found Ross to be an MC with great potential (\"Hustlin'\") who solidly disappointed me.  This left me a bad impression prior to Ross's second #1 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Trilla\/dp\/B000XXWK9I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Trilla<\/a>, which I failed to purchase.  Consequently, it featured stronger material than it predecessor, but it wasn't quite enough to convert me.  Then came along the critically acclaimed&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Deeper-Than-Rap\/dp\/B001T46THE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Deeper Than Rap<\/a>, which made me a full-on Ross convert.  I thought after DEEPER, that there was no way Ross could top it, but with the \"deeper\"&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Teflon-Don\/dp\/B003IMES78\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Teflon Don<\/a>, Ross actually extends upon the successes of 'Deeper' opting for less commercial concessions.  Sure, maybe being less commercial is the last thing a gold-selling artist like Ross should be doing, but honestly, I think Ross may have created his 'masterpiece' with 'Teflon Don.'\n\nThe album opens up with a bang (much like 'Deeper Than Rap') did with \"I'm Not A Star,\" which finds the MC instantly spitting \"ether.\" While its just as \"mix-tape-esque\" like \"Mafia Music\" from 'Deeper', it doesn't allure as much as that track did, but I appreciate Ross's aggressive honesty.  Second cut \"Free Mason\" featuring the unstoppable Jay-Z is an instant classic upon the first listen. With soulful supporting vocals from John Legend, Ross is on autopilot and Jay-Z just adds the fuel to the creative fire.  \"Tears of Joy\" is another certified masterpiece, with incredibly soulful vocals from Cee-Lo (of The Goodie Mob, Gnarls Barkley) and another well-crafted set of rhymes by Rick Ross.  \"Maybach Music III\" continues the string of well crafted tracks, featuring soulful vocals from Erykah Badu, and strong verses from T.I., Jadakiss, and none other than Ross. The production of \"Maybach Music III\" particularly stands out, even eclipsing \"Maybach Music II\" from 'Deeper Than Rap'.\n\n\"Live Fast, Die Young\" featuring Kanye West doesn't allure me as much as \"Free Mason,\", \"Tears of Joy,\" or \"Maybach Music III\", but it is still a solid, much-better-than-average cut (glad to hear \"Mr. West\" rapping again).  \"Super High\" is another stellar cut featuring none other than \"Young MJ\" (Ne-Yo) sounding exceptionally strong.  The production is quite alluring on \"Super High\", making it one of my favorite cuts.\n\n\"No. 1\" featuring Trey Songz and Diddy works, though it is less convincing in my eyes than the more soulfully-produced, thought-wrenching numbers. Despite this, Ross has become such a sound MC, it doesn't matter because his rhymes are still strong.  \"MC Hammer\" featuring Gucci Mane works better in my eyes, with it Southern rap styled production via freakish-sounding synths and 808s.  \"B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)\" is no miss either), finding Rick Ross as strong as ever.  \"Aston Martin Music\" features Drake and R&B standout Chrisete Michele.  While \"Aston Martin Music\" is by no means my favorite cut, Michele's vocals are understated but beautiful.  A miss? No, there are no throwaways on this brief, but well constructed album.  The track is a bit long for my tastes. \"All The Money In the World\" features neo-soul standout Raphael Saadiq and proves to be a solid closer.  Ross seems very adept at closing albums on a high note.\n\n'Teflon Don' definitely secures a spot as one of 2010's best rap albums.  While it may not eclipse efforts by Drake or Big Boi's exceptional&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sir-Lucious-Left-Foot-The-Son-of-Chico-Dusty\/dp\/B003FGWSL0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sir Lucious Left Foot...

This is the latest solo single from Nicole, and honestly it is fair, but not really anything that truly seperates her from her Pussycat Dolls music.

I was hoping that there was more on the song that brought out more of the spark that could've broke her out more on the song, and the voice she has to offer.

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers, who has became more like a manufactured product, and not even a real human songstress anymore. When it had came to pulling out a surprise record for the music industry and for her own fans, she honestly made a poor choice of songs for herself, and lost the ability to reach into a human soul. Her collaboration with Nicki MInaj on the remix of her wasted song Flawless, was definitely a poor choice of song to collaborate. Nicki doesn't actually make a bad song good, she makes a poor song, want to wish you plugged your ears and never heard Beyonce' or Nicki ever again. There is absolutely no chemistry together in the song, and as for Beyonce', she really wasted her own talent away by trying to be more street and rough, and lagging the talent from her own voice to follow in suite. If you are a fan of Beyonce', or even a fan of Nicki, I would recommend passing this song up, because it is purely flawed.\n\nSong: F","classification":1,"fold":2}

{"text":"50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck of G-Unit are back once again, this time with The Beauty Of Independence EP, and they have a special talent to introduce, Kidd Kidd, who is new to their roster and label, G-Unit Records. The Beauty Of Independence is a great showing of solidarity from G-Unit, considering the fact that all four original members are on the EP. When nature dictates that groups tend to disband over time, this complete reunification is a feat in and of itself. The gang are essentially back to their old antics, and this consistency proves to be a fitting formula. The opener, \"Watch Me,\" brings listeners up to speed and establishes the current level of musicality with which the group is comfortable and proficient. It is gangsta through and through, and as an introduction to G-Unit in 2014, it screams to audiences everywhere, \"Here they are!\" The follow up track, \"I Don't F--- With You,\" is more real gangsterism over concert style cornets, giving way to \"Digital Scale,\" a track almost exclusively dedicated to the subject of drug dealing, a topic which is touched on again in \"The Plug.\" Nowhere is this G-Unit crew more eloquent, however, than on \"Changes,\" where they discuss reversals of fortune and how nothing ever really remains the same over time. Overall the guys do a good job of being lyrical on a competitive level, and some nice, new territory is explored production-wise throughout. The Beauty Of Independence is a nice EP with high marks for having good energy and perfect attendance.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Well, for those fans looking forward to a blistering holy cow return-to-form story, there may be some disappointment. Despite the interesting new band line-up with Angras Kiko Loureiro and Lamb of Gods excellent drummer Chris Adler; Dystopia, Megadeths fifteenth full-length studio album is not necessarily the career highlight that hype and wishful thinking may have lead us all to believe.\n\nThe new lineup is great and not gimmicky, but its still the Mustaine show here on Dystopia. Band-leader Mustaine still writes a huge percentage of the music, so despite the line-up, it doesnt suddenly sound much like Angra or Lamb Of God either, although you can definitely pick up on their involvement during breakdowns or solos if you're paying attention.\n\nWith that out of the way, Dystopia is a good album. Of course it is. Its a Megadeth album that isn't Risk, of course its a good album. Its more or less the same Megadeth album that the last four ones have been, with about the same level of similarity and difference as each of the last four have had with each other. Its slightly heavier than 2013s Supercollider, its slightly more consistent than 2011s Thirteen and slightly thrashier than 2007s United Abominations, but when all is said and done, its relatively similar to them all, especially the less famous mid-album stuff. 2009s Endgame is arguably the closest record to this stylistically in the Medageth catalogue; thrashy yet modern, fast on paper but still varied and with plenty of mid-tempo moments, energetic and revitalized but not necessarily earth-shattering. They're arguably quite similar in quality too, as well as stylistically.\n\nIf youve enjoyed Megadeths recent output, this is good. Its good for me, Ive been really keen on all the recent albums personally. If you only like a particular period such as the 80s or 90s however, Id give up now because despite the hype theres not that much difference here to anything the band have turned-in since the millennium.\n\nThere are a few interesting moments here and there, such as a touch of piano and spoken-word at the end of Poison Shadow or some Spanish guitar at the beginning of the instrumental Conquer Or Die but again, nothing you haven't heard before from a band with such a long and storied career as Megadeth ...who have covered a lot of ground already in their time. Apart from having a cover of Fears Foreign Policy at the end, which admittedly fits in well thematically with the majority of the rest of the records tone anyway, the album doesnt particularly have any stand out moments or obvious hits, it isn't an album of highlights and filler, it feels very consistent, and benefits from being absorbed in a single listening session rather than picked and chosen from. Thats a good thing though, this is a good album that works well as an album, that is good all the way through and that feels like a complete whole.\n\nWith all of that being said, its then understandably hard choose favourite tracks from Dystopia; for me Lying In State is one of the strongest, a track which sounds very close to the style of the faster stuff on 2004s The System Has Failed, and has lead guitar lines that don't sound much like any previous Megadeth material. Another noteworthy track would be the fun, bouncy The Emperor which feels like the better Thirteen material and would sit rather nicely beside Whose Life Is It Anyway? in concert.\n\nOverall; Dystopia is another post millennial Megadeth album of strong quality that satisfies on every level, but that probably won't go down in the history books. The guitars are sharper, the vocals have more snarl and the lyrics are a bit more politicized than Supercollider for example, but I think business as usual is a fairer summation of the record than best album since because, for me at least, Megadeth have been dishing out high quality, enjoyable, entertaining albums of this quality all along.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Kudos to Dierks Bentley for attempting a contemporary crossover bluegrass album.  It would seem natural for country music stars to produce bluegrass albums, but the effort is apparently harder than it seems, as few have been successful.  Although conceived and marketed as a \"bluegrass\" album, \"up on the ridge\" has more of the sound of the usual pop country fare.  This is a mostly acoustic album and Bentley took the usual formulaic gun-for-hire by employing a veritable all-star cast of bluegrass luminaries (Chris Thile, Sam Bush, Ronnie McCoury, etc.) for this album.  However, bluegrass fans and musicians would be hard pressed to recognize the music here as bluegrass per se or even newgrass.  Rather, the overall impression is that of that syrupy concoction known as popular country music, but perhaps a little less cloying.\n\nIt is not surprising that this album feels inauthentic.  Dierks Bentley grew up in Arizona and attended an east coast prep school. He does not speak with a southern accent.  his southern singing accent is fake and is incorrect in both its intonation and diction for the Appalachian accent of authentic bluegrass music.\n\nNevertheless, if one can get beyond the incongruity of these issues, this is not a bad little album.  Some of the songs are quite enjoyable, although with few exceptions, such as Bob Dylan's \"Senor\", the album is populated by songs with the usual pop country fare of pedantic lyrics.","classification":3,"fold":2}

Some call it 'dinner music' but how could you sit still with Coltrane on the sax.  The newer version includes the single version of MFT, but this is just great for sitting back, and relaxing.  If you don't have it, get it.  You will not be disappointed!  BTW, it has since been determined that Coltrane was very unique in his playing because of what he did with his breathing technique.

{"text":"Ridley Scott has always been a director who knows how to incorporate score in his pictures, his track record with composers has been excellent. Hes created films with classic scores from composers like Vangelis, Jerry Goldsmith, Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams, Marc Streitenfeld and more. But even Ridley is not immune to that infamous Spanish tax credit that studios are flocking to. Theres a reason why Roque Ba&ntilde;os is scoring Ron Howards In The Heart Of The Sea and not Hans Zimmer, theres a reason why Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez scored Brett Ratners Hercules, theres a reason why Lucas Vidal's name is on Fast & Furious 6 and theres a reason why Alberto Iglesias is scoring Exodus: Gods And Kings. These (very talented) composers aren't getting these big breaks because of their creative abilities and match to the films material, no they are getting hired because their country of birth is paying Hollywood some nice incentives to do so. While I love Alberto Iglesias and his work, he ended up on this film because of his nationality and that forces Ridley to work with a composer hes never worked with before. So when you see that two other composers including Harry Gregson-Williams had to chip into this score, maybe studios will realize that creative corner-cutting isn't the best way to pocket some tax breaks.\n\nNow, Exodus is in no way a bad score. This is a fantastically robust and lush score that relishes in its biblical epic genre of music. However, after powering through the mammoth amount of music, one cant help feel a bit of emotional disconnect. The music is beautiful to listen to and at times is gorgeous, but I found a hard time latching onto any emotional arcs. Everything here seems built to embellish and match the bombastic visuals. In that sense you could say the music is theatrical, but given that the film takes itself very seriously one could feel the music is doing too much at times. It took me a while to find the motifs in the score, and I still cant be sure if Im hearing a central theme. When you have that much music, and no clear thematic material then you feel lost and aimless. It has all of the expected structures and elements. You got the big lush orchestrations for weight, you have the Middle Eastern elements to establish your Egyptian setting, big chorus to add gravitas, and percussive action for the battles (thanks to Harry Gregson-Williams). While all the ingredients are there, the score never really establishes its own identity. I never felt emotionally moved or engrossed by the music despite how beautiful its approach was. It almost seemed like a stage performance I was watching, but admiring from afar and never getting pulled into the narrative. The fact that Harry Gregson-Williams was called in for action support and Federico Jusid was called in for support in the spiritual and emotional department, shows that there were lots of leaky holes that needed plugging up. Harry did the same thing for Ridley on Prometheus. However, here Harry would have been probably the most ideal choice here given his masterpiece of a score to Scotts Kingdom Of Heaven. In the end the score is completely adequate, it fulfills its duties completely. However, when you go into a Ridley Scott film, you're expecting a musical accompaniment that is just as special as the story its accompanying. With Exodus: Gods And Kings you will find a large-scale orchestral score with all the expected elements to it, and not much else.\n\nAlberto Iglesias is a brilliant composer, but his talents are better suited for certain films and a Ridley Scott epic is not one of those films. Everything does work, nothing about the score is terrible but nothing is great either. What we have here is a serviceable score that brings the expected ingredients to the table and serves us a dish weve all tasted before. Sure we love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but it would have been nice to try something fresh and new with a little more personality to it. The additional music from Harry Gregson-Williams and Federico Jusid do stand out as stylistically different, but are much needed for support. Exodus: Gods And Kings embraces the biblical epic genre, but in the end the score won't stick with you for long. As a person who believes in continued creative collaboration, I think it's very counter productive for studios to force directors to work with composers just for a tax break. Alberto Iglesias is an amazing composer, but if the main reason you're working on a film is because the studio gets some cash back in their pockets then it completely defeats the purpose of a natural creative collaboration. The final product speaks for itself, adequacy without memorability.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"I pretty much agree with EJ Rupert, but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves.  I gave this album 4 stars for that very reason.  Though it was never released as a single, \"My Block\" is one of Tupac's best songs (pre death row era is the best 'Pac in my opinion).  I don't think there's any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes Red and Meth's \"How High\" as an unquestionable classic (and this is the grimy version of How High....not the fluffy remix).  I still get open to that beat 11 years later.  Though it is somewhat formulaic, \"Poppa Luv It\" is still a dope cut from LL Cool J.  Bone Thugs N Harmony, Mary J. Blige, and  Onyx contribute \"Everyday Thang\", \"Everday It Rains\", and \"Live!!\" which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion.  Also, \"Sowhatyousayin'\" is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind.  Even when you get past those great tracks, you have other bangers like \"Kill Dem All\" [Kali Ranks], \"Glamour & Glitz\" [A Tribe Called Quest], and \"Still Can't Fade It\" [Warren G.] that still make for a great listening experience.  Hell, even The Dove Shack blew up on the strength of \"Summertime In The LBC\".  And the live version of Biggie's \"Me & My B*tch\" is definitely different from the studio version and it's great.  There's plenty to love about this album.\n\nI also agree that there are too many filler tracks.  \"What's Up Star\", \"Ol' Skool\", \"Domino's In The House\" and \"Zoom Zooms & Wam Wam\" all fall under the filler category.  Actually, the filler tracks are the only things wrong on this album and I'd say that only 10% of the album is filler.  The rest is bangin'.\n\nThe Show Soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile pick up for any hip hop fan.  There are bangers on this album that make it a must own.  If you were into hip hop around the time this came out, you remember when half of these songs were played for the first time.  There are definitely some classic tracks on this album.  I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso, for those of you that want more artists represented, check out the \"Rhyme & Reason\" soundtrack (which is pretty much similar to this, but with better collabos).  You'll find a lot of artists there too.\n\nStandout Tracks: Poppa Luv It, My Block, Live!!!, Kill Dem All, Summertime In The LBC, How High (My Favorite), Everyday Thang, Everyday It Rains, and Me & My B*tch [Live]","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Wow! Eight months after its release this cd continues to absolutely blow me away. Twelve songs of irresistible non-stop energy, clever changes of pace, forceful yet sensitive vocals, endless hooks and lyrics that beckon the listener to sing along, loudly. This may not be \"one of the best albums of the past twenty years\" as Brandon Flowers proclaimed. However, it is without doubt one of the best releases of 2006. One of the hallmarks of a classic record is that it stands up to repeated spins. For me, Sam's Town accomplishes this in spades. In fact, the more I become familiar with these songs the more I enjoy them.\n\nOn this record one terrific song follows immediately on the heels of another. There are twelve tracks. The cd runs for just 44.14, once again proving that length is far less important than quality. Some of my favourite recent cds are about the same length as a traditional LP record (the second Arctic Monkeys is 37.34). As a die hard rock and roller I don't need filler and I don't want cuttings from the studio floor - tunes that would never previously have seen the light of day!\n\nSuperficially this record reveals more American influences than the debut. There are the obvious vocal and lyrically similarities to Bruce Springsteen. Flowers has mentioned in interviews how he has \"rediscovered America\".  However, when all is said and done, what I hear are the same influences as on Hot Fuss - Queen, Bowie, and 80's Britmusic. Anyway, the band's sources of inspiration are, when all is said and done, irrelevant. This is a superb sophomore effort. I reserve five stars for the best of the best - Revolver, for example. Sam's Town is a worthy four and a half star effort. Will the Killers be able to make it a hat-trick? We'll see.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I am only slightly aware of Justin Bieber's trajectory, but his recent comments on various social issues caught my attention. On several issues he seemed to have somewhat confused takes on things, leaving people to wonder what he meant. But on the matter of a woman being raped and then becoming pregnant which she then sought to terminate, he was unequivocal. Justin Bieber stated: \"Everything happens for a reason.\" This was his way of explaining why he thought it was wrong for the woman to seek termination. Well, the bizarre theology which apparently this kid has been raised with is not the first issue. Even though it sounds more like pagan fatalism than any sort of Christianity. But that begs the question, which is closely related to the only point that really matters here: Are we now even beyond the idiot culture? Have we moved even a step further into the quicksand. Is our cultural vacancy now to be assumed  as pregnant with potential philosophy???  This can be shown phenomenologically by the fact that comparable stars of the past  like Leif Garret were not asked for their philosophical reflection. But now the modern equivalent, Justin Bieber, is. I think Justin Bieber should quit philosophizing  and reflect rather on practical maters like  whether he will be wearing a bandana on his head in future as faded star Leif Garret does now: Vanitas vanitatum!","classification":1,"fold":2}

{"text":"Currently Emilie Autumn's image\/music tends towards... well, the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque, industrial-goth-doll. But her debut album had a vastly different flavor -- while it has the same dark edges and spatterings of industrial rock here and there, \"Enchant\" is a more romantic, Victorian\/medieval album.\n\nIt opens with an ethereal, twinkly expanse of sound, and Autumn intoning the first four lines from Shakespeare's 53rd sonnet. Then she launches into a starry rendition of her own poetry: \"Across the sky\/I will come for you\/If you ask me to\/Demystify\/Your uncommon dreams\/Stranger things have come true...\"\n\nThat opening song may give you the impression that Autumn is a sort of Delerium\/Enigma artist, but she quickly proves that it's not the case. Instead, she dabbles in a little of everything: hard-rock in \"Chambermaid\" and the blaring \"Heard It All,\" some spacey jazz in \"Second Hand Faith,\" rambling piano ballads in \"Castle Down\" and \"Ever,\"  dramatic string-soaked ballads in \"If You Feel Better\" and \"Save You.\" It ends with the satiny \"Epilogue: What If,\" which just reinforces that Autumn is not someone you can pin easy labels on: \"What if I'm a snowstorm burning\/What if I'm a world unturning\/What if I'm an ocean, far too shallow, much too deep?\"\n\nAmong the best songs are a trio of pop songs  which have a sort of medieval\/fairy-tale flavor: \"Rapunzel\" is a bittersweet song about... well, Rapunze; and \"Juliet\" is an exquisite, glittering swirl about... well, Juliet. And \"Rose Red\" swings between a spiky pop sound (\"Tell me no stories and I'll tell you no lies\/No one wants to hurt me\/but everybody tries!\") and a luscious ye-olde one (\"Rose Rose Rose Red\/Will I ever see thee wed?\/Only if you can capture me\").\n\nI probably could have guessed that \"Enchant\" was Autumn's first album without even checking wikipedia -- it sounds like she was experimenting with different styles and trying to figure out which one fit her best. You can hear some romantic goth, classical, hard-rock, jazz and a bit of Regina Spektor's anti-pop here. But \"Enchant's\" different styles flow easily into one another.\n\nThis is mainly because of Autumn's classical musical skills -- she winds silken strings of piano and violin around almost every song, along with some shimmering keyboard and the occasional blasts of electric guitar. The entire album has a sort of rock'n'roll Victorian-romantic flavor, and quite frankly that combination is something I wish there was more of.\n\nHer voice is also very lovely and versatile: she can sound punky, angelic, or low and powerful. And her lyrics and poems are very evocative and atmospheric (\"But would you tear my castle down\/Stone by stone\/And let the wind run through my windows\/'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose\"), and tinged with a sense of bittersweet romance.\n\nWhile it explores various musical styles, \"Enchant\" has a distinctive flavor that shows off Emilie Autumn's talents -- and leaves you wanting to see whatever else she's produced.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Having enjoyed some instrumental versions of a few pieces in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/30-Must-Have-Cello-Romances\/dp\/B00GTUHDL4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">30 Must-Have Cello Romances<\/a>, I thought this greater variety of pieces was worth trying.

{"text":"Amy Winehouse has shot to fame quickly over the past few months thanks to her brilliantly crafted album `Back to Black'.  A disc rich with eleven tracks all blistering forth with originality and effortless charisma, `Back to Black' is a dream album, a coupling of everything that is perfect in the music world today and something that most artists dream to one day achieve.  Amy has delivered to us, her loyal fans, one of the most memorably perfected albums to date.  Not a song deserves the skip button and not a single second is wasted.  Amy's voice is so authentic, so impressively elegant that I'm stunned to silence almost every time I listen to this album.  When you look at her you'd never imagine something so powerful would come from those lungs, somewhat like hearing the powerhouse vocals from Joss Stone for the first time and having to sit back and catch your breathe you're so blown away.\n\nThe disc starts off with an impressive number, the first single `Rehab' and it does the trick.  It instantly hooks the listener and brings that punch that the remainder of her tracks will display.  Her voice is crisp, the hook is engrossing, the beat is splendid; everything fits perfectly.  Like `Rehab', most of Amy's best tracks are the more up-tempo offerings.  Following `Rehab' is another fantastic track, `You Know I'm No Good'.  To me this track one-ups the previous.  It adds layers of sultry sexuality that `Rehab' lacks.  To see this chick live is my next goal for I have a feeling that the atmosphere of her performance will only add to the effective aura her album emanates.  Another up-tempo track that delivers effortlessly is `Tears Dry on Their Own'.  The chorus itself is so catchy you can't help but sing along.  The beat for `He Can Only Hold Her' is one of my favorite and the whole bouncy feel to the song bring back memories of days of old, lounging around the pool in my youth.  I just love it.\n\nSome of the slower tracks exude a little more sexuality in her voice and tone.  The first of these is `Just Friends'.  It's a very sultry song, subject wise and in momentum.  As she recites a relationship (affair) with a man already spoken-for her voice is so intoxicating it's impossible to turn your attention away.  Not to mention that the beat itself is one of my favorite on the album.  Falling along these slow-tempo lines is `Wake up Alone' which also works beautifully.  It's the title track `Back to Black' though that may very well be my favorite track here, but that's something I struggle with since every song is just so brilliant.  The song is so effortlessly intoxicating, the beat, her vocals, the lyrics and when she slows everything down and repeats `black' over and over I'm just smitten in the most endearing of ways.  It's amazing the effect good music can have on a person.\n\nIf any song here can dethrone `Back to Black' as my favorite it would be `Some Unholy War'.  I really can't explain the joy this song makes me feel.  I love its simplicity, its raw energy.  Same can be said I guess for `Me and Mr. Jones' which is just utterly infectious.  I don't see how anyone could stay seated still throughout this track.  I can't help but sing along to this brilliant track.  It carries much the same upbeat vibe that her single `Rehab' infuses.  The closing track `Addicted' is probably the funniest track here and due to that very fact it's probably the most fun as well.  I've heard talk about her being very open about her drug habits, and while this is no where near to the drug talk in your average rap track it's still shocking in it's bluntness for her genre.  The only track here that fails to utterly impress me is `Love is a Losing Game'.  It just doesn't really grab me.  It's a bit monotonous and redundant, but it's short enough to allow it to play through.  Plus, the next track ultimately redeems it.\n\nSo, the verdict is adore, love, support and relish Amy Winehouse.  She's a rarity in the music industry.  There really isn't a soul like her.  She effortlessly exudes class (at least on disc) and maturity that are beyond her years.  I am not one to readily over praise an artist.  In fact I usually shy away from any artist, actor, singer, author etcetera who I feel receives too much praise for their own good.  In this case though I feel every stitch of praise is well deserved.  `Back to Black' is the first album in years that I am in complete and utter awe of.  I don't see this leaving my disc-player for quite some time.  Sit back and enjoy.","classification":5,"fold":2}

[Explicit<\/a>] sported the most commercial success (bowed at no. 2 with 139,000) while&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/iexcl-DOS-Explicit\/dp\/B00A12VW86\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">&iexcl;DOS! [Explicit<\/a>] is arguably the best of the trio though experienced less success.  &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! is expected to sell even more modestly than &iexcl;Dos! did. Sales for none of the trio have been remarkable, but all three albums have been above average and enjoyable. &iexcl;Tre! has its exceptional moments just like its counterparts, epitomizing Green Day's consistency.  Had the best of the three albums been merged into one,  Green Day probably would have had a juggernaut on their hands.\n\n\"Brutal Love\" opts against the obvious, opening the effort with a mid-tempo rock ballad. Reaching back to classic, traditional rock, there are tinges of country-rock incorporated as well - on a punk revivalist record of all  things! Solid songwriting truly shapes \"Brutal Love's\" success: \"Turn out the lights, close your eyes\/turn up the silence, the heartache of your life\/dance forever, under the lights, this brutal love...\" All-in-all, going against the grain bodes well in Green Day's favor on this particular record.\n\n\"Missing You\" accelerates the tempo with Green Day's signature driven guitars reinstated. The epitomization of bright punk-pop, \"Missing You\" is pleasant, sound, and enjoyable.  The songwriting plays like a teen who has experienced his first heartbreak: \"I'm missing you... you're not around and I'm a complete disaster.\" Two for two Green Day.\n\n\"8th Avenue\" delivers this installment's first brief cut (under 3:00). Driving and similarly bright like \"Missing You,\" Billie Joe Armstrong reaches back to his youth asking his love \"...meet me in the bathroom stall\/meet me at the whispering wall\/before all the flames burn out...\" On \"Drama Queen,\" Green Day contrast tempo again opting for slower cut.  Initially only accompanied by acoustic guitar, bass and drums eventually enter in buttressing the production.  Some musical highlights include the incorporation of piano as well as a bluesy guitar solo.\n\n\"X-Kid\" also features a killer guitar solo that wails.  Quicker, \"X-Kid\" still resists the lightening speeds that truly defined much of &iexcl;Uno!.  As evidenced by previous cuts, Billie Joe Armstrong focuses on youthful themes. \"Sex, Drugs & Violence\" truly epitomizes that sentiment, in which Armstrong sings \"Back at school it never made much sense\/now I pay but I can't pay attention.\" He goes on to finish his sentiment on the chorus: \"Sex drugs and violence, English math and science\/safety in numbers...\" \"Sex, Drugs & Violence\" may be a stretch to make the forty something a teen or twentysomething once more, but it does sound very much like classic punk-revivalist Green Day.  \"Sex Drugs & Violence\" ends up being one of the best of the entire trio of albums.\n\n\"A Little Boy Named Train\" is catchy and possesses a driven sound while \"Amanda\" accelerates the tempo even more, finding Armstrong stating \"I'm not playing with your mind\/unless you think I am\/and you were crushing my heart\/like a battering ram...\" The lyrics are schmaltzy and ultra cheesy, but assuming Armstrong's sentiment is to deliver &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! from a teenage male perspective, he and his band accomplish that well.\n\n\"Walk Away\" establishes an anthemic nature on the chorus; by the end, Armstrong adds some extra grit to his distinctive snarl.  \"Dirty Rotten Bastards\" reminds one of \"Jesus of Suburbia\" from American Idiot due to the ambitious stylistic changes.  It's indulgent, Armstrong is profane, and the cut is all over the place - but it is distinct and quite an interesting listen.  At nearly six and half minutes, it is the longest cut on any of the trio.  That said, its restlessness makes the six and a half minutes go by painlessly.\n\n\"99 Revolutions\" proves driven, quick, and straightforward; just a solid, well-rounded cut.  Closing cut \"The Forgotten\" is shockingly tender - almost too much so for the punk-revivalists.  The biggest quibble might be that a five minutes, the cut remains a bit too static and safe, particularly for such a rebellious bunch as Green Day are.  Who else could've made such a political statement with \"American Idiot\" in 2004? Quibbles aside, \"The Forgotten\" shows off a different side of the band, enhanced further by Tom Kitt's lovely string arrangements.\n\nHow does &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! stack up? Ultimately it is consistent with the trio.  &iexcl;Dos! still remains my personal favorite and maybe &iexcl;Uno! would be my second choice, but overall, all of the trio are solid affairs.  The argument, as suggest prior, can\/will be made that merging the best of each album would've delivered a home run.  That argument aside, those who invested into the trio now have enough Green Day to last them until they record a new album, which only happens every couple of years. A solid close to an underrated trio of albums.","classification":4,"fold":2}

In 2013, Andrew Stockdale released his debut solo album, \"Keep Moving,\" which was good but not on par with his previous two albums recorded under the Wolfmother moniker.  2014 saw the release of \"New Crown\" (before it got it's full official release earlier this year), and it was lackluster at best.  And now we have \"Victorious,\" perhaps the closest Stockdale has gotten to the band's debut release since 2005.  \"Victorious\" is a solid album all around, and it has that driving hard rock feel of the band's early work.  However, it's less introspective than 2009's \"Cosmic Egg,\" which is my favorite album that Stockdale has released thus far.\n\nMy favorite tracks on the album are the title track and \"Pretty Peggy.\"  The rest are standard fare for the band:  good, honest, heavy-hitting stoner rock.  Andrew's guitar work is, as always, well on display throughout the album.  Any fan of Wolfmother--old or new--will have a hard time finding fault with this album.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).\nI am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's \"Nickel Romeo,\" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (\"Something That You Said\", \"I Will Take Care of You\", \"Grateful\"). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on \"Ask Me No Questions\" and \"Here Right Now,\" and Vicki sounds great on \"Single by Choice,\" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock.\" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \"Mixed Messages\"? As for \"The Rain Song,\" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!\nThe ensemble vocals on \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Stealing Rosemary\" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.\nMy only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened 'Doll Revolution' by dropping \"Lost at Sea,\" \"Song for a Good Son,\" and \"Between the Two.\"\nI understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to 'Doll Revolution'. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","classification":5,"fold":2}

David Foster is very talented, but his music highlights the musical arrangements rather than the voices of his singers.  The first listening to Illuminations blew me away.  While the arrangements certainly are not stark or overly lean, Groban's voice is allowed to shine through first and foremost unlike in his previous offerings.  And voice is what this man is all about.  I can understand (although not agree) where some people might have a problem with the songs chosen for this project, but I can't understand how anybody can criticize his vocal prowess.  I would highly recommend this CD to any of my music-loving friends.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"It is a real pleasure to see the X5 \"99\" series coming to composers, like Edvard Grieg earlier and now Camille Saint-Sans, that are not on the forefront of popularity -- not the Beethovens, Bachs and Mozarts of the classical world. This is a great set and represents a remarkable bargain. Particularly with composers who are off the beaten path, there is a much better chance of really expanding one's collection and musical horizons with a set like this.\n\nUntil now, for example, I basically owned only a copy of Saint-Sans numbered symphonies and the famous \"Carnival of the Animals\", plus a few stray tracks that were featured on earlier X5 sets. This collection adds fine performances of the \"Urbs Roma\" symphony, the Symphony in A major, three violin concertos, two cello concertos, two piano concertos, an orchestral suite, a handful of solo organ works, and a number of shorter works.\n\nSaint-Sans was a diverse intellectual and by all accounts the finest organist of his day, who played at churches throughout his career, culminating with a permanent job as organist at the huge neo-classical Madeleine chuch in Paris. He was was a real revolutionary early on, championing new music in a conservative French classical world -- new music at the time being especially by composers like Liszt and Wagner.\n\nBut by the end of his career, he became an arch-conservative, almost reactionary. He railed against Cesar Franck, Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, for example. He is also famously said to have walked out of the first performance of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" in a huff over the \"misuse\" of the bassoon -- although Stravinsky himself insisted this was fiction and that Saint-Sans was not even in attendance. He also suppressed the publication of \"The Carnival of the Animals\", now his most popular work, until after his death, reportedly because he was afraid it would hurt his reputation as a \"serious\" composer.\n\nHe shouldn't have worried too much, because he left behind a lot of great music. I'm happy to get to know a lot more of it here. The set includes most of the main works he is remembered for now, including Symphony No. 3 (the Organ Symphony), Introduction and Rondo Capriccio, Violin Concerto No. 3 and even selections from the opera \"Samson and Delilah\". One could complain it is missing some of the later piano concertos, but overall, the selection of works is really outstanding.\n\nThe set is wonderful, but it isn't perfect. My main gripe is that the Carnival of the Animals is not an integral performance -- \"The Swan\", the most famous bit, is by the Stockholm Chamber Duo rather than the St Petersburg Radio Symphony, which performs the rest of it. This is a gratuitous change -- not to mention that the version of \"The Swan\" offered here has already appeared on four different previous \"99\" sets. In addition, tracks 65 and 66 are reversed -- or should be. I changed them in my library so that track 65 continues on into tracks 67 and 68 -- the rest of Piano Concerto No. 2.\n\nBuyers of previous sets will find only minimal duplication here. The following tracks have appeared on earlier \"99\" sets:\n- 2. Introduction and Rondo Capriccio (99 Most Essential Violin)\n- 9. Carnival of the Animals: VII Aquarium (99 Darkest)\n- 15. Carnival of the Animals: XIII The Swan (four different sets)\n- 17. Danse Macabre (99 Darkest)\n- 23. Havanaise in E major for Violin and Orchestra (99 Most Essential Violin)\n\nAlso, the third movement of Piano Concerto No 2 was featured on the \"Allegros\" set, but in a different performance.\n\nThe technical quality is very good, with nicely engineered recordings. Bitrates all variable, averaging in the 184-270 range. The 9.7 hour set has a total download size of 958 MB.\n\nAs a previous reviewer said, many of these recordings were first put out on the Bis label. The following albums look to be included in substantial part and sometimes in their entirety:\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Saint-Sans-La-Muse-et-le-pote-Violin-Concerto-No-2-Spartacus-Overture\/dp\/B00005TNB5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saint-Sans: La Muse et le pote; Violin Concerto No. 2; Spartacus Overture<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Saint-Sans-Capriccio-Music-for-violin-orchestra\/dp\/B0000060H2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saint-Sans: Capriccio - Music for violin & orchestra<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Saint-Sans-Urbs-Roma-Symphony-2-Africa\/dp\/B0000016NZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saint-Sans: Urbs Roma \/ Symphony 2 \/ Africa<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Camille-Saint-Sans-The-Two-Cello-Concertos-Romance-for-cello-orchestra-Symphony-in-A-major\/dp\/B00000G5QE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Camille Saint-Sans: The Two Cello Concertos; Romance for cello & orchestra; Symphony in A major<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Saint-Sans-Violin-Concerto-No-3-Works-for-solo-instrument-and-orchestra\/dp\/B000M4RF8E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saint-Sans: Violin Concerto No. 3; Works for solo instrument and orchestra<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Saint-Saens-Piano-concertos-nos-1-2-Suite-for-orchestra-in-D-major\/dp\/B00004TXTV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saint-Saens: Piano concertos nos. 1 & 2; Suite for orchestra in D major<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Camille-Saint-Sans-Symphony-No-3-Organ-Symphony-Danse-Macabre-Bacchanale-Trois-Rhapsodies\/dp\/B0000016I9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Camille Saint-Sans: Symphony No. 3 \"Organ Symphony\"; Danse Macabre; Bacchanale; Trois Rhapsodies<\/a>\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Camille-Saint-Sans-Fantasies-in-E-flat-major-D-flat-major-C-major-Bndiction-nuptiale-The-Preludes-Fugues\/dp\/B0000016IA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Camille Saint-Sans: Fantasies in E flat major, D flat major & C major; Bndiction nuptiale; The Preludes & Fugues<\/a>\n\nThat is a ton of value for $7.99.

His bass playing isn't too technical but it always packs a punch and his vocal style is easily recognized. In a time when many metal vocalists sound so much alike one another, I like to think I could have identified his voice as the one on this album even if I didn't know it was his band beforehand.\n\nMetal is a good album... I wouldn't call it great. But as a fan of Jason Newsted I felt I should show some support and buy it. There's nothing too flashy just straight metal which is what he was clearly going for here. I could have used a little more versatility in the drum section but again it's not horrible. The album almost feels a bit rushed as if they threw something together to hurry and get ready for a tour or to make some sort of deadline. I'd be curious to hear what this band can put down given ample time to write out an entire album's worth of material. The production sounds great overall. I give it 4 stars for being a good first effort and for being straight metal and not the usual mix of growls and clean vocals we're hearing from everyone else. A worthy first album but I know Jason is capable of much better. I say buy it.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Demi Lovato's music took a little while to grow on me.  Before she had her problems and spent time in rehab, her music pop-y and sweet, and forgettable.  Her first song back, \"Skyscraper\", was ok, but seemed to be a labored effort to sing about how she was overcoming her struggles.  Her next hit, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was a lot more energetic and fun.  It really started to endear Demi and her singing to me.\n\n  Now, we have her next big hit, \"Heart Attack\".  The first 15 seconds of this song nearly prevented me from ever listening to it (and is why this does not get 5 stars).  The intro sets her voice with some posing R&B styling and then morphs into a horrible autotune before the rest of the song gets going.  If it wasn't for the fact that I wasn't paying enough attention to this one, and I made it past this 15 seconds, I would never have discovered the emotional power of \"Heart Attack\".  Demi is able to get fun and flirty with the verses and then convert to a passionate power ballad voice in the chorus.  There is nothing that comes off as artificial in how she expresses herself in this song (other than the first 15 seconds).\n\n  Demi is doing a lot to bare her soul through singing.  This is, no doubt, part of the healing process for her, while also allowing her fans to benefit from her outstanding voice.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"As odd as it may be, out of the hundreds of CDs in my collection, few of them are Christmas CDs, and of the Christmas CDs I do have, there aren't many of them that I listen to very often, even during the holidays. This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall \"laid-back\" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a \"celebrity\" but as more of a \"grandfatherly\" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and \"Rudolph\" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of \"Little Drummer Boy\" that I've heard! \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be \"Christmas Can't Be Far Away.\" The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is (under 30 minutes). It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff, or had been paired with Burl Ives' Christmas Album (which contains completely different material). But still, this is a wonderful album!","classification":4,"fold":2}

A lot less screaming (which in my opinion is for the better), he seems to have taken on more of the industrial sound over the metal. Don't get me wrong, the metal is still present, but the industrial is the more prodominant sound heard here. I like it a lot.

{"text":"This album is destined for a classic status. Aside from Don Henley it is really incredible the amount of talent that surfaces throughout this disc. From the song writing to the personnel,  this album has the potential to leave you awe struck. I was pleasantly surprised to see all the input of Stan Lynch throughout this CD.  Lynch was the former drummer in Tom Petty's band. To me it is really a positive to see Lynch collaborating with the likes of Henley's immense talent as well as all the incredible musicians and singers on this collaboration of tunes.. From the opening cut \"Bramble Rose\" you will be sucked in to a fascinating perspective written by Tift Merritt and delivered by the superb vocals of Henley, Miranda Lambert, and Mick Jagger all of who have never sounded better or more convincing. The band here is perfect. If this was the only cut on the CD it would be worth the purchase price but this is only the beginning of opening this albums door to eleven other songs. Each song is as powerful as the last one. Each song here has the capacity and demeanor to be the favorite. What a plus it is to hear Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton, Martina McBride sing lead  and individually share the vocals with Henley on different tracks. This album is country music, real pure heartfelt country music with vision. Something  evident here is Henley's  tremendous growth as a musician, and song writer.  I get the feeling that this is a very personal album not to be taken lightly. Songs like \"I Pray for Rain\", I hope will resonate with listeners in a way which will motivate and reinforce people to support the greater good for us all.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This album (Or mixtape). Whatever anyone wants to call it, is amazing. Start to finish, is the best way to play it.\nMy most favorite song is Balmain Jeans. The song has a very chilled back feel and features Raphael Saadiq. I feel like the harmonies Raphael brings along with Cudi's lower Tenor goes well with one another.  But every song on here has its flare as well. There are a couple purely instrumental tracks that I thourally appreciated. Any TRUE Kid Cudi fan will appreciate and vibe with this CD. If you haven't been accustomed to his sound and his journey you may not like it. I'd recommend visiting any of his earlier projects.\n\nI gave it a 5\/5 because he did not stray from his self, he knows who he is and what he is doing.

{"text":"I was visiting Norway and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway. Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"The city of Muscle Shoals has long been known as a musical area- as it has the famous studio that has recorded some of the biggest names in rock & roll, rhythm & blues and country music. The latter of the genres continues to be the breeding ground for talent out of the city, with the most recent being the Drive-By Truckers frontman Patterson Hood as well as John Paul White- former member of the duo The Civil Wars. Joining the recent list are the siblings Laura Rogers and Lydia Rogers- collectively known as The Secret Sisters. They had a deep love for traditional country music- styled in the vein of Patsy Cline and The Everly Brothers, and the duo weren't shy of admitting as such. Altough one of the sisters initially attended college for a degree in business, in the end music became their calling. They were discovered by producer Dave Cobb (best known for his work with Shooter Jennings and Jamey Johnson) and were brought to the attention of record producer T-Bone Burnett. He was so enamored with them, he created a record label for the sole purpose of releasing their material. Their self-titled debut arrived in Fall 2010, and was produced by Cobb with Burnett taking an executive producer credit. Furthering their love of traditional country, all but two songs on their debut were covers and the entire recording was recorded and mixed on vintage analog equipment.\n\nIn 2012, the duo appeared on the soundtrack to the blockbuster film \"The Hunger Games\" contributing the song \"Tomorrow Will Be Kinder\". Around that same time, they appeared on a couple of compilations and made appearances on albums by Willie Nelson and former Eurythmics member Dave Stewart. At the end of 2012, they went back in the duo to record their next album- which arrived in Spring 2014. Their new album \"Put Your Needle Down\" still has its roots in traditional country, but with tinges of rockabilly here and there. Joining them for the album is their mentor T-Bone Burnett on production, with session drummer Jay Bellerose, T-Bone's right hand man and keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, Gurf Morlix and legendary Motown Records' Funk Brothers member Jack Ashford. Starting off the album is the first single- the Brandi Carlisle penned \"Rattle My Bones\" (Carlisle also helped pen another track on the album- the ballad \"Bad Habit\"). Former Semisonic frontman Dan Wilson helps out with the writing on the murder ballad \"Iuka\", where a woman desires to elope with her boyfriend- against the wishes of her very abusive father. Bob Dylan helps pen the abrupt kiss-off \"Dirty Lie\", while they cover PJ Harvey's song \"Pocket Knife\", an album track from her 2004 album \"Uh Huh Her\". They sing about wanting to wallow in heartbreak on \"Let There Be Lonely\" while pleading with a lover not to leave on \"Black And Blue\". \"Put Your Needle Down\" is another great album from The Secret Sisters. They took a bold step in writing and performing their own material this time around and it paid off for them. It's only a matter of time before the mainstream catches up with them.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"First off, the packaging...in a lovely, luxurious red velvet BOX, not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be...with the title gold embossed.  Open it up and the treasures flow out...first a round red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W cover, and Robin's buggish sunglasses...he looked downright alien-ish...a precurser to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!)...with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known...prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give \"Odessa\" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song...all versions.\n\nNow, the songs, oh man, THE SONGS!!!!  There are 3 CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there ever was one) release...CD1 is the 17-track album in stereo, CD2 is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CD3 is the REAL treat, the 23-track \"Sketches For Odessa\"...cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio.\n\nI won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise\/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album ever, a true masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album.  I don't know what is better, the stereo or the mono...they both sound great.  I love the songs on \"Odessa\", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3-part harmonies and excursions into alt-country\/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes...it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece, yet each track coulda worked as a killer single (except the 3 instrumentals of course).  Faves are def \"Melody Fair\", \"Marley Purt Drive\", \"Give Your Best\", \"Never Say Never Again\" (ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), \"I Laugh In Your Face\", the awesomely cool Maurice-led \"Suddenly\"...on and on, one of THE great pop\/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...\n\nNow, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, \"Nobody's Someone\" & \"Pity\"...those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!  They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer.  Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, \"First Of May\"...nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single...\"Melody Fair\" or \"Marley Purt Drive\" or the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks...\n\nNOW, with this GRAND 3CD reissue, people will realize what they truly missed, the treasures in store for them.\n\nSo far, best reissue of 2009...nothing will top this.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"For his first solo album since 1978's self-titled \"Paul Stanley,\" this Kiss frontman has produced a batch of polished rock songs that reach back to mainstream '90s arena acts, with the backing of modern players (guitarist Corky James, drummer Victor Indrizzo, and keyboardist Harry Sommerdahl) who've powered mainstream hits for Avril Lavigne, Macy Gray and Carrie Underwood. That latter connection, via Carrie Underwood to American Idol, isn't one to miss as these overwrought power ballads could easily pad one of AI's rockers' debut albums.\n\nKiss fans will notice that Stanley's written with several of his early collaborators, including Desmond Child and Holly Knight, but he's also brought in Andreas Carlsson, who's worked with Bon Jovi, and Marti Frederiksen, who's penned songs for country crossover diva Faith Hill. Stanley set out to \"sing about my life because my life is not that different than anybody else's,\" and the results are human-scale songs that skip the rock-god grandeur of Kiss. Such songs turn out to be substantially more pedestrian than the best work of Kiss.\n\nThe band has studio chops (that is, this isn't the sort of organic band effort one would expect from Kiss), and Stanley's in good voice. His production adds a touch of oomph, but not enough to give this any sort of sweaty rock band rampage, and the album's power ballads, \"Second to None\" and \"Loving You Without You Now\" have neither the story or heart of \"Beth.\" Kiss Army members may want to stash a copy of this in their tents, just don't pack it in your day pack.

{"text":"With a title like \"Fast Car,\" one would probably expect an upbeat, blood-pounding song in the vein of \"Shut Up and Drive\" or even \"Life Is a Highway.\"  One certainly wouldn't expect a poignant, even melancholy ballad about escaping the drudgery of life... only to find oneself back where they started in the end.  And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow.\n\nIt's not a happy song... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully.  Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic, conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song.  And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low-key.  Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung, and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here.\n\nWhile a melancholy song, \"Fast Car\" is still lovely to listen to, and certainly more thoughtful than the endless parade of love songs that make up popular music nowadays.  If you like James Taylor, you might also enjoy \"Fast Car.\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

However, my only concern is via the caveat the character mentioned about being remembered more for how they lived and explored their life more than the money they made. Please understand that Im not implying that there is anything wrong with that belief. Im only making the point that I respectfully disagree that money is not important to enjoy certain life experiences. For instance, the current online music video for the nights by avicii shows a person who to his credit is living an exciting life, yet there is one scene where he using his car. Having at least a certain supply of money is essential for the upkeep of a car. My point is that the car in the video proves that money is still important to enjoy certain facets of life and that a person has to be able to generate a certain level of income to buy and keep a car. Aside from that caveat, the nights by avicii is a quality song and productive video.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Too many of them contain way too much \"political\" orientation and sometimes this sort of thing tends to ruin the overall impact of what might make an otherwise good song even better.

The songs really have defined here as a definitive diva in the ranks of legends like Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and the great Natalie Cole. Every song from Secrets really remains seductive, beautiful from the essence of the soul of the songstress itself. When I think of Secrets, I really think of every song because it defined her more than her debut record did in 1993. One of my favorite songs that still ignites from Secrets, You're Makin' Me High, still ignites as a sensual essenced song that will really want to make you get your groove on with the one that you love. The song still 20 years after it came out, is strong as other sensual songs like Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On and Chris Isaak's Wicked Game. It is one of my favorite seductive songs that really is worth the money, and if you have never heard a Toni Braxton song, well this is one the top tracks I absolutely recommend overall.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":2}

She definitely needs to find better for her fans, and for her own self in voice. Her latest single, G.U.Y., the third single from Artpop really doesn't ignite or light up a fire the way her other songs had done before in her little monsters' hearts. I really didn't find the song to catch a fire the way people felt with Katy Perry's Roar and the songs that Beyonce' had shown like Drunk In Love.

She showed more in voice than any of today's female artists in each note than someone like Rihanna could prove in a lifetime, and wasted themselves away. That can also be said for Anita Baker. It has been a long time since Anita had came out with something new. Her last album, 2004's My Everything was classic and beautiful from her sultry voice. Anita's latest is a cover of Tyrese's hit lately and it really delivers. I like how she put her classic swooning on his song, and made it her own.

{"text":"Old style Mello Music Group producer Apollo Brown from Grand Rapids and Detroit, MI continues to blaze flaming trails in hip-hop's underground with his Sept. 25-released LP, Grandeur, an undulating trip down the life paths of each of its emcee-guests, and Brown is up to speed again with his downbeat yet decadent beats. The rappers here provide so many bits of wisdom and anecdotal little stories about life that they could almost fill a canyon with them, and what accompany these fluid contents are Brown's rich flowing beats that have a melancholic taint and samples that stop quick but also pick up before the preceding phrase is done. In a nutshell, Grandeur is a hip-hop joyride with plenty of golden age flavor.\n\nWith emcees like Oddisee, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P., Evidence, Ras Kass and Masta Ace (plus plenty of others), Grandeur is able to gather all these great shades and vocal styles, but the poignant, sad slowness of Apollo Brown's productions guide them onto a less than vicious platform, meaning the lounging r&b character in the music brings out a certain side of each rapper. Fortunately, this is not a bad thing if you're out to get chill, cool-out hip-hop, and plus, the words they impart will have your synapses snapping and clicking far more excitedly than any beat there is here.\n\nParts of Grandeur will mean different things depending on who listens, but a few connecting, lasting moments include Oddisee seeing a 'mono' plane of view stating, \"all there is around here is work,\" which basically means all he sees is people slaving for the man day in and day out (see \"What You Were Lookin' For\"). Another one of course is Chino XL in \"Brass Tacks\" taking shots at puppet rapper OT Genasis in the chorus. Apollo Brown uses a few recycled samples here, which is a little questionable, but the save is that with them, he has created new unique versions different from the originals they first appeared in. A more or less typical compilation LP, Grandeur is a win, albeit not a huge one, for Brown and company, and although he hasn't evolved tremendously since the last time he dropped, he is still one of the game's most skilled young producers respectful to his forefathers.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is second to only With the Beatles as my favorite of the group's pre-Rubber Soul albums. I'll admit it was a tentative time for the group, but they made unforgettable music during that period. Most of this album is catchy, hook-filled rock: the title track; The Night Before; You're Gonna Lose That Girl (with Ringo turning in some of his best drums in history); Ticket to Ride; You Like Me Too Much; Tell Me What You See (the closest thing to an underrated Beatles song I can imagine) and the acoustic I've Just Seen a Face are the highlights here. There are also a couple ballads, the strongest being John's Dylan-esque You've Got to Hide Your Love Away. On the other hand, George's I Need You is miserable, and the much-hyped Yesterday is, in my mind, bathetic lounge music and easily the most overrated Beatles song in history. That's just me, though. There are a few other duds (Another Girl, Ringo's awful C&W showcase Act Naturally), but this album is much better than I had given it credit for on my previous review, which desperately needed editing.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"\"Black and Blue\" might not be to the taste of rockers who expect every Stones album to trot out another \"If You Can't Rock Me\" or \"Rocks Off\", but I've always found it to be a refreshing change. Listen to the samples, you'll see what I mean. The samples don't do justice to every song here but you'll get an idea of this album's groove. Song for song I prefer it over \"Goats Head Soup\" or \"It's Only Rock & Roll\" (although both of those do have a number of Stones classics). And \"Some Girls\", half its album cuts sound boilerplate thirty years on, but of the eight songs on \"Black and Blue\", the only throwaway would be \"Crazy Mama\".\n\nThe track most frequently included on my car CD compilations is the funky workout \"Hey Negrita\", with \"Hot Stuff\" a close runner-up. It's worth noting that most collections (like \"40 Licks\" or whatever it was called) include the edited single versions of \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Fool to Cry\". \"Melody\" is another favorite, distinctive within the Stones' catalog, a good song for hanging out with friends late at night. Years later UB40 would also cover \"Cherry Oh Baby\", but listen and compare, see if you don't agree that the Stones version is far better.\n\nIf you've picked up a few Stones albums and you're at risk of tiring of their sound or you think you have what you need already, try \"Black and Blue\" on for size. After the four albums that are the pinnacle of their career - Exile, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Beggars Banquet - this would be the next one on my list.","classification":5,"fold":2}

As a single, I thought it was good when in first came out, catchy, unique, good build-up. However, this song has worn on me, and not by radio mind you, but just the song itself. The song could be described as an angry power-rock (rather than power-pop) anthem, and because of the style that goes along with a song like this, it just doesn't hold any staying power. Maybe for a month or two, but then it's history.\n\nSo overall, if you've never heard the song, try it, you might like it.

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional durge upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"Human\" has a little bit of all of Brandy's past albums. This album will lure you in.  Listen to it completely one time and you will come back for more.  This album is so incredible.  There is something about Brandy Norwood that I simply adore.  Perhaps it's the fact that I feel like I grew up with her because, yes, she is famous, but there is an aura around her that is so genuine and pure, maybe that is why she titled this fifth effort \"Human.\"  Or maybe she called it Human because she bent the truth about being married to Robert Smith. Hmmm. Could it be because of the fatal accident she was involved in?  We may never know for sure, but what we do know is that she will has never disappointed her fans with her music.  She knows what diversity is and she is no stranger to good music.  If you aren't convinced, listen to \"Brandy\", \"Never Say Never\", \"Full Moon\" and \"Afrodisiac\", then you will lay any queries to rest once and for all.\n\n Lyrically, this album is a gem.  Brandy let listeners into her innermost feelings and the outcome is unforgettable.  Vocally, oh wow! I have never heard her sound so good.  I can recall classmates ridiculing her for her weak voice when I was in grade school, but if they would just listen to her now, at her best.  Sometimes she does sink into straining her voice, but when she gets herself together, it is magic.  Her voice is naturally different and that separates her from the other R&B singers.  \"Right Here (Departed)\" took some time to get into, but it is a quality track once you get into it.  \"Piano Man\" is worth countless listens, especially because of her shout-out to longtime collaborator Rodney Jerkins and that infectious hook.  I love this song; it's one of the albums finest moments.  \"1st and Love\" is another highlight.  It definitely has that classic Brandy sound.  I have never heard Brandy sound better than on the album's title track. I was doing something when the song played, but I stopped dead in my tracks in order to give her my undivided attention.  If you can only listen to one track from this album, listen to \"Human\" and listen good because Brandy is in rare form.\n\n Needless to say, this is one of 2008's strongest and most unforgettable releases, I am so proud of Brandy because I have watched her transition from a teenager into a beautiful woman.  If this review has been helpful in any way, please go out and get yourself a copy.  You won't be disappointed, but if you are, Brandy is only human.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Piano Man\"\n2. \"Human\"\n3. \"Warm it Up (With Love)\"\n4. \"A Capella (Something's Missing)\"\n5. \"Camouflage\"","classification":4,"fold":2}

The repetitive nature of the \"Holy Holy Holy\" gets old and the fact that it is wedged between nearly every other statement (and yes, the fact that they are statements) makes this rather underwhelming.  I really wanted something better from Wye Oak.  Even when she changes up her \"Holy\" with \"Hold Me\" it isn't really clever enough to validate appreciation.  I love her voice and the way that she creates complete moods with her music, but there is nothing modern or wholly impressive about this track.  She sounds older than she is and the whole track comes off a tad underdeveloped.  It isn't terrible (the ending bridge\/chorus explosion is perfect) but it lacks a true spark needed to make it stand out.\n\nI love me some Oak, so I'll be listening to more from her for sure; I just wish that this was a clearer representation of what she's capable of.","classification":3,"fold":2}

Yes, he's had his share of problems over the years, but in his business, who hasn't?

{"text":"\"Rock N Roll High School\" by the Ramones is a upbeat, pop-punk song of mild teenage angst.  Shonen Knife has covered it faithfully here, but not brought anything new to it.  Except for the female voices, there is very little difference between this cover and the original.  Shonen Knife presents the lyrics with a straightforward delivery that doesn't suit the song's fun-loving vibe; I get the feeling they were spitting the words out more than trying to capture their feel.  It's not bad, but there's absolutely nothing special here.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Note: this is a review of the CD only, not the bonus DVD.\nFly from Here the new album by Yes is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to.\nTrevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer\/cowriter, and the product is brilliant.\nNote: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album).\n This release also marks the debut of Benot David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track \"Fly from Here\" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled \"We Can Fly from Here\". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to Benot David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part \"Fly from Here\".\nThis album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"GREAT stuff, sequencing and establishing a mood of downcast but with a silver lining of hope, and indie-singer\/songwriter-minded, just like those 2 prior soundtracks with people like Elliot Smith and Tim Buckley.  I originally bought it because it has exclusive tracks by 2 fave artists on mine in Lykki Li and Charli XCX.  But while their contributions did not disappoint in the least, it was the others' tracks which made this soundtrack a REAL keeper, especially Birdy.  With 3 tracks here, all exclusive, and all written by her, I was just blown away and moved by her songwriting, voice and style...I went right and bought her 2nd album \"Fire Within\" this week, as it came out here on Tuesday.  I was familiar with her self-titled debut from 2011, mostly covers but done oriiginally, and her song on the \"Hunger Games\" soundtrack...but those 3 songs here just blew my mind...partially cuz she worked with one of my faves, Dan Wilson from Semisonic\/Trip Shakespeare...but her vocals just moved me like few artists do...and she's so young!!  Besides her, Charli and Lykki Li, everyone else is great here, like a cool, personal mixtape from a friend or significant other with great taste...this has a personal feel rather than a hit feel...and it's equally moving and fresh and even fun.\n\nGet it!!","classification":5,"fold":2}

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Things added to his orange juice...\n\nJoao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.\n\nFor better Getz, pick any other decade or his life.

It makes sense that the record company and probably Rob Zombie himself had no faith in it being a great album... if you can even call it one. It's more of an EP. There is only about 5 or 6 songs on this, and the rest is either talking\/radio cut filler crap, or some stupid short instrumental that doesn't even sound like J5 is even trying to tune into his talents.\n\nThere is 2 decent songs I don't mind. One being UFO and the other Get Your Boots On. Neither make any sense, or have much meaning, but when does Rob ever do that anyway? The UFO one I take a liking to because it reminds me of Jerry Reed, if you know who that is, and sounds like Jerry gone Rob Zombie style which is unusual, but makes me wonder what Rob would sound like covering \"East Bound and Down\" lol\n\nThe other stuff on here is easily forgetable. Not Rob's best work and the album just feels incomplete like the big singles are missing from it. I expect as per usual, Rob will try to rectify the negative reviews and bitter tastes in fans mouths left hungry for more by releasing a deluxe edition soon with a few more songs or a quick cover of something to fill in the 40-50 mins remaining of CD time this one here has left blank.","classification":2,"fold":2}

Strong overall, Food & Liquor II relies on critical stroking more than commercial aspiration. Cerebral and lengthy at seventy minutes, it takes several listens and isolation within each selection to digest all of Fiasco's themes.\n\nLupe's sister, Ayesha Jaco opens on \"Ayesha Says,\" delivering poetry incorporating social issues name-checking Jim Crow, Traevon Martin, and \"...the west side of Chicago\/where food and liquor stores still occupy the block...\" It establishes the social tone of the effort. \"Strange Fruition,\" (featuring Casey Benjamin) follows, produced by common Lupe associate Soundtrakk. Well produced, the cut incorporates a lovely sample and hard drums. The chorus plays well to the strengths of the title, much like a symphonic `tone poem' depicts a narrative.\n\n\"ITAL (Roses),\" produced by 1500 or Nothin', finds Lupe delivering  a hook laden with words and social references.  Lupe's recycles some on the second verse, but justifies it within clever, if pointed lyrics. Dense but genius, the 'roses' still smell fresh here. \"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free),\" the first single is anchored by samples from Jefferson Airplane and Pete Rock & CL Smooth.  Lupe raps incredibly agilely, delivering his best lyrical reference on verse 3, alluding to  Wu-Tang Clan (\"...cash rules everything around these...\"). The hook is 'wordy', but basically finds Lupe criticizing 'false media.' Overall, it's a highlight.\n\n\"Audubon Ballroom\" features some clever punchlines including references to bling-bling, Facebook, and 'all black everything.' The hook is racially-charged, finding the MC digging in headfirst into socio-cultural issues \"B**ch Bad,\" the second single from the effort (produced by The Audibles) is both the album's best and most controversial showing. Ultimately,  Fiasco scolds parents for promoting 'endearing' use of the term towards women while also word-playing. Prone to turn some off, the cut is ultimately very clever.\n\nRemaining on 'autopilot,' \"Lamborghini Angels\" is much more commercial than previous cuts, though still manages to be neoteric. The hook trends commercial (\"I see diamond flooded demons\/Lamborghini angels...halos down with the doors flapping when they come through...\"), while the verses characterize the MC, most notably on the final verse. \"Put 'Em Up\" keeps the quality high, particularly the production and a catchy hook.\n\n\"Heart Donor\" adds popular Lupe collaborator Poo Bear along, 'riding' a production by The Runners.  Bear declares himself to be \"...a heart donor...everything I got, I give it all to you\/my heart and my soul, I give it all to you\" on the lovely hook. Good, \"Heart Donor\" still plays second fiddle as opposed to being 'the concertmaster.' Bilal steals Lupe's thunder on  \"How Dare You,\" outperforming the MC ultimately, who falls ever so flat here.\n\nLupe recovers in a big way with Guy Sebastien on t \"Battle Scars,\" produced by Pro-Jay and Sebastien. Guy Sebastien sounds incredibly soulful, nuanced, and pitch-perfect, earning the dual-crediting of this cut. \"Brave Heart\" (once again featuring Poo Bear) is a downgrade, with Poo sounding less notable and Lupe sounding solid, but less so than better, more preeminent cuts.\n\n\"Form Follows Function\" gives Lupe another dynamic solo spot, reminiscent of the soulful-productions that graced Food & Liquor.  \"Cold War\" sports an agile Lupe, if more casual than desired.  Jane $ $ $ performs the hook, that educates listeners on `the cold war.' \"Unforgivable Youth\" features Jason Evigan (frontman of After Midnight Project), whose hook is a bit casual, though clearly slated in pop\/rock-rap.  Closing cut \"Hood Now (Outro)\" is too long, but enjoyable and more relaxed than many of the album's cuts. (Various versions sport an additional song as the seventeenth and final cut).\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Food-Liquor-II-The-Great-American-Rap-Album-Pt-1-Explicit\/dp\/B009AQM9NQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 [Explicit<\/a>] is characteristic Lupe Fiasco. Double and triple meanings run rampant here.  The effort is cerebral, enjoyable, overstuffed, and brilliant, all at different points in the seventy minute affair.  At times, one desires a 'sellout' \"The Show Goes On\" while the most dedicated fan is pleased with the lyrical wealth.  An edit would have boded well (10 - 15 minutes), but all in all, Lupe gets it done.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"My love probably isn't big enough for Lianne La Havas. I don't really partake in traditional romance; the kind of \"love\" she's referring to here; so most of my affection would be restricted to her pretty doll-like physical appearance. I think I could get swept-up in her music though, to the point where, even if I'm not actually in love with it, my mind would be too hazy, my \"heart\" too fluttery, to tell the difference.\n\nSome of these songs come close to demonstrating that fact, particularly the two in which she's stripped down to just bluesy vocal melodies and an acoustic guitar. Age and Tease Me are both dedicated to \"you\", the guy she's questioning in the title, like every other song. The one that interrupts the flow is the one you can hear a guy's voice replying back on, No Room For Doubt, also one of the album's best.\n\nComing from a new pop artist, the set is something like a breath of fresh air. It's not so hard to create this kind of cozy coffeehouse soundscape. All it really takes are skilled musicians playing live instruments softly as opposed to programming thumpy electronic ones. What makes it stand-out is the arrangement of the vocals on top, something this \"love\"-smitten Lianne girl has an apparent knack for.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":2}

Happy that she is realizing that she is beautiful on the inside and outside.\n\nCool for the Summer  ( 5 out of 5 stars)  This song was so much fun listening to the song and it reminded me of Jessie J domino which I love.  Plus who doesn't like a fun summer song?\n\nOld ways  (5 our of 5 stars)  At first I was skipping this song but then I finally listened to it and I felt that it was a great song\n\nFor you  ( 4 out of 5 stars)  It was okay I felt that it was kind of boring\n\nSTONE COLD  ( 5 out of 5 stars)  WOW.  I can say that this song has been on repeat since I bought the cd.  What a song her vocals are on point with this song.  For some reason this reminds me of Adele in parts of the song.  This is the knock out song for me anyways.\n\nKingdom come  ( Torn on this one 3 or 4 out of 5 stars)  3 stars for the iggy's part I just felt like she half hearted her part.  Demi part was a 4 stars but sill it not my favorite on the album.  Iggy family matters really when did that show get cancel.

Yes she is hot Yes Demi has matured and grown so much no longer feel that she is a teeny bop music.\n\nFather  ( 5 out of 5 stars)  Another stand out for me this is a great song she tells the truth even on the lyrics where she said that she thinks she hates him.  She doesn't hold back.\n\nStars  (3 out of 5 stars)  okay that all I can.  I skip this one most of the time\n\nMr Hughes (5 out of 5 stars)  I like this one its fun and love the sick beats.\n\nThe last two songs are Cool for the summer remixs and I give the first one 4 out of 5 and the last one 5 out of 5 stars\n\nOver all buy this cd its way better than the new Selena  cd","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Like sands in the progressive rock hourglass, these are \"The Days Of Our Yes\"....\n\nYou'll remember last time on \"The Days Of Our Yes\", it was 2008, and the prog-rock soap opera known as Yes had just had a line-up change AGAIN, though this latest line-up change has really, and I mean *really* rubbed some of the band's fanbase the wrong way. It was bad enough to lose everybody's favorite Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman (AGAIN), who left (AGAIN) to pursue other music projects, but not only that, highly-worshipped lead singer Jon Anderson was forced to bow out of the band's planned 40th anniversary tour due to poor health. Did the rest of the band do the decent thing and wait for Jon to get better? Nope. Determined to tour and move on, they replaced him with a younger singer named Benoit David from the Yes tribute band Close To The Edge, and on they went (first with keyboardist Oliver Wakeman, son of Rick, and now with \"Drama\" keyboardist Geoff Downes returning behind the keys once more). And now, after 10 long years, Yes have a brand-new studio album, \"Fly From Here\", with former \"Drama\" singer Trevor Horn reeled back in as producer (and look, serendipity, we've got the Buggles in Yes again!). Yup, it's the \"Drama\" thing happening all over again. Some fans have been very supportive of the new Yes line-up, while other fans have deserted amidst cries of \"No Jon, no Yes!\". Which brings us to the new album itself....\n\nI'll cut to the chase: if you like \"Drama\" (a.k.a. you're open to a Jon Anderson-less Yes), then you'll like \"Fly From Here\" just fine. If you *don't* like \"Drama\" (you know, the \"No Jon, no Yes!\" mentality rearing it's head in you), then skip \"Fly From Here\". It's that simple really. I could probably end my review right there, but I'll go on a little bit more....\n\nConsidering that this is practically the return of the \"Drama\" Yes line-up, it's no surprise that \"Fly From Here\" could easily be renamed \"Son Of Drama\". It sounds pretty similar to that earlier 1980 album---how can it not? However, in my opinion, this is not at all a bad thing, 'cause I like \"Drama\" very much, always have. With all due love & respect to the great Jon Anderson, Yes are not The Jon Anderson Band. Yes are Yes. Even though there's no disputing that Anderson has made the far-greatest impression as lead singer for this band, I enjoyed Trevor Horn's vocal contributions on \"Drama\", and now, I like Benoit David's vocals on \"Fly From Here\". David actually sounds more like Horn than Anderson, but that's fine. I think he does an excellent job at the microphone (ah, but will he get to sing on another Yes album, or will he be a one-off like Horn was? Only time will tell). As for the Yes veterans, despite being in their 60's now, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White and returning keyboardist Geoff Downes all deliver the goods here and they still have wonderful musical chemistry. The songs are excellent---the epic title suite simply glows from start to finish, with great interplay from everyone. \"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\", with Squire on vocals, is the most \"poppy\" song on the album, but it's very catchy and heartfelt, and works quite well. \"Life On A Film Set\" is a powerful number, and \"Hour Of Need\" is wonderfully upbeat. Steve Howe's solo guitar piece \"Solitaire\" is a gem, and the finale, \"Into The Storm\", is a great, breezy rocker. And for the icing on the cake, Trevor Horn's production on the album simply sparkles.\n\nThe only thing that makes me deduct a star from my rating of \"Fly From Here\" is the overall sense I get that the album falls *just short* of masterpiece status, as it sounds like \"Son Of Drama\". Still, this is a very, very solid, excellent Yes album nonetheless, and I, for one, am willing to give this latest incarnation of Yes a chance. It's quite obvious that \"Fly From Here\", like \"Drama\" before it, ain't gonna satisfy every single Yes fan. Then again, the Yes fanbase has been heavily divided on every single album Yes have released since 1974's \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\", haven't they? (1972's \"Close To The Edge\" seems to be the last Yes album that *everybody* likes.) Yes will forever be a controversial band I suppose, but give these guys some credit---they DO have some great music all throughout their catalog, and not just on their first five albums, pre-\"Topographic\"! And \"Fly From Here\" contains more great music from this prog-rock warhorse, and I'm happy with it. Despite the controversy that follows them around no matter *what* they do, Yes rock on with \"Fly From Here\". And I'm glad.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Brown, she is really finding her footing well in R&B and Soul. She did that noblely with Shark In The Water, her first single from her debut single from Travelling By The Light, now her latest single, L.O.V.E. tries to bring out the 60's Pop & Soul rhythms of the mainstream, that acts like Dusty Springfield brought out back then.

I actually like that this album, and their previous one, is strong throughout, without weaker songs added simply to extend the length.  They do write much more \"pop\" songs than other \"indie\" bands, and I expect BoH has much more mainstream appeal because of this, but that's not always a bad thing.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"In the past decade Disciple has gone from a band to the solo project of the lead singer.  And the quality in the music really has shown it.  I have to admit nothing about the previous album did anything for me, and I can't even remember one song from it.\n\nThankfully this album steps things up a bit.  Disciple continues the overly generic sound they've had since Horseshoes and hand grenades, but they pull it off a little better here.  While I don't love every song on here they are at least listenable, with some really good ones in there, mostly at the beginning of the album.\n\nRadical starts the album off with an anthemic vibe.  It's kind of typical for Disciple but still enjoyable.  Attack is next and it rocks harder and has a great hook in the chorus.  This is my favorite song on the album.  Dead Militia is next and I really like this one too.  Nice verses a good chorus and an overall nice flow to the song, with a little bit of a different feel to it.  Scarlet is next and this one has a nice melody.  Some of the lyrics are a bit cheesy but the song is still enjoyable.  Unbroken is the first ballad and it has a really good chorus.  the song itself is a bit cheey but listenable.  I could do without the \"whoa\" part though.  The name is a cool rocker, but unfortunately after this point the songs become less memorable.  Kamikaze at track 10 is another solid rocker with a nice hook, but everything else feels like filler to me.  They aren't terrible songs or anything, but they aren't really songs that I connect with.\n\nSo overall this album is a bit uneven, but it has a decent enough consistency where at least there aren't any completely cringe worthy songs like in the past 2 albums.  I swore I wouldn't blindly buy another Disciple album, and then proceeded to do that again.  Fortunately I feel a lot more rewarded this time around.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to any fan of the band.  It's a nice step up and I hope with the new lineup they stay together for a while and grow as an actual band rather than changing musicians every album.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 75 out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10 if amazon allowed for a more specific rating.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"After spending several years experimenting with their sound and trying to prove to the world that they, too, hate nu-metal, Linkin Park finally returned to their roots with long-player number six in 2014. Although it cannot be deemed to be a true return-to-form for the band, \"The Hunting Party\" tries to recapture the same levels of musical friction, energy, and all-around irresistibility first heard on 2000's debut, \"Hybrid Theory.\" And while it never quite successfully does so, several of its songs make a valiant attempt at it.\n\nAs a result, the album does do what previous efforts (i.e. 2012's electronic rock-leaning \"Living Things\") failed at: Scratching your Linkin Park itch. Indeed, even though it by no means is an Earth-shattering affair, or a particularly deep one (some of the material races by without leaving much of a lasting impression on the listener), it is all-but guaranteed to satisfy both schools of fans: The old school and the new school. Indeed, does \"T.H.P.\" possesses just enough new-ish-sounding elements to maybe turn a few new heads, while at the same time retaining that angsty rap-metal flavor that got the band to be so big in the first place. By doing so, they have created a heavy and adrenalized, yet simultaneously melodic and never out-of-control record, and one that is in the running for being the year's crowning nu-metal achievement.\n\nThere are several cameos from guest instrumentalists\/vocalists spread out over the course of these twelve tracks, but of those four guest spots, only half of them are noteworthy. Helmet's Page Hamilton chips in with a catchy, cleanly-sung chorus on \"All For Nothing,\" thus offsetting the tune's fluid, youthful rap-rock stylings really well. (The rest of the track is occupied by hip-hop-ish vocal stylings and lyrics that are primarily centered around a few really good rhymes.) The end result is a sound that recaptures the one heard on the band's earliest recordings (\"All For Nothing\" kind of evokes the band's fourteen-year-old hit single, 2000's \"Faint\")\n\nAnd the other notable cameo comes in the very next song: \"Guilty All The Same\" finds Rakim chipping in with some great guest rapping, thus helping to further the tune's potential for heavy radio-rotation. With that said, though, it would have been one that stood out in its own right, as it is a pretty darn great mix of bobbing, lurching guitar hooks, heavy, grumbling bass lines, and tight, driving rhythms that flow perfectly into deftly sweeping and fist-pumpable choruses. Add what sounds like something that could pass for a little mini guitar solo (or a whammy bar\/wah-pedal-abusing guitar lick, if nothing else), and the end result is a song that has all of the makings to be a new Linkin Park classic.\n\n\"The Hunting Party\"'s other two cameos, though -- System Of A Down guitarist Daron Malakian on \"Rebellion\" and Tom Morello on \"Drawbar\" -- are both almost completely transparent. (A grave shame when considering what a great talent either of those guitarists is.) Fortunately, there are enough of other standouts found elsewhere to more-than-compensate for any of these shortcomings. Opener \"Keys To The Kingdom\" is one early highlight, as it is a potent mix of brutal, viscerally angsty and bratty screaming and supple, calm, sweet crooning; and \"War,\" which almost plays like a blast of nearly full-on hardcore punk (and is a very muscular and propulsive song, needless to say), is another.\n\nOther standouts include the groovy, staccato guitar crunch and more deft, sing-scream-rap vocals of \"Wastelands\"; the touching \"Until It's Gone,\" which is a much gentler and more docile piece, a near ballad if you will, and one that is centered around, sweetly-sung choruses that are big and epic enough to require their own area code; and \"Final Masquerade.\" The latter of these three songs might have a catchy, funky, trip-hop-esque beat, but is ultimately a number that, thanks to its utilization of some of Linkin Park's all-time best and most accomplished clean singing, kind of reminds of L.P.'s \"In The End.\"\n\nBut the set's two biggest highlights are actually found elsewhere. \"Mark The Graves\" puts the album on heavier ground, as it is centered around a massive, thunderous, lumbering guitar riff. Said track also features some tricky tempo and arrangement change-ups, but again, how about that riff (!): It is as commanding and memorable as anything that six-stringer Brad Delson have ever produced! And the second arguable highpoint comes at the very end: \"A Line In The Sand\" is a very seamless, insanely hooky, and infectious shuffle. It transitions from effortlessly fluid rapping to hard-rocking guitar-driven crunch seemingly without even breaking sweat. The end result is the deepest and most epic tune on the whole record, hands down.\n\nIn summary, \"The Hunting Party\" is Linkin Park's best effort since 2003's \"Meteora,\" and one that might not be a true \"classic,\" but is still one that shows definite signs of improvement for the band. It is not exactly a reinvention (or even drastic expansion) of the form, meaning it is not an absolutely essential or life-altering listen. But nobody could argue that it is anything less than a really fun and enjoyable one. And at the very end of the day, could you really ask for anything more?","classification":4,"fold":2}

Their selftitled album is full of electronic rock anthems; it's poppy, fun, and exciting.  The slippery guitar riffs, the distorted bass, the pounding drums -- it all makes for layered music that is very accessible and really engaging.  It's a great major-label debut - this band is going to find an even bigger audience than its previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/ANNA-SUN-EP\/dp\/B0072NV8PE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ANNA SUN EP<\/a>&nbsp;allowed.\n\nThe album opens with \"Quesadilla,\" an introduction that begins with fluttering synthesizers before launching into a rolling Johnny Marr-esque guitar riff.  \"Lisa Baby\" launches the band into a fun, poppy, electronic number.  I was familiar with the Walk the Moon's breakout song \"Anna Sun,\" but I have to admit that the rest of the album does a good job of matching this songs quality; it's not even the best song on this album.  \"Jenny,\" a Maroon 5-like track, sounds destined for play in dance-clubs.  WALK THE MOON is consistently good, but I will agree with other reviewers that I wasn't crazy about \"Iscariot,\" a slow track that doesn't quite pack a punch.  The album is concluded with the fantastic \"I Can Lift a Car;\" a track that is optimistic and melodic.  It ends WALK THE MOON with a calm, determined smile.\n\nWhile this genre doesn't usually grab me, WALK THE MOON is fantastic; I loved this album.  It's engaging, accessible, and energetic.  This band is destined for big things.  Fans of Young the Giant, Two-Door Cinema Club, Imagine Dragons, or Grouplove will find a lot here to enjoy.  Standout tracks: \"Lisa Baby,\" \"Anna Sun,\" \"Jenny,\" and \"I Can Lift a Car.\"  Sampling these songs here on Amazon will give you a good idea of what to expect from this album.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Eight of these tunes made their way into the Billboard Top Ten. During those same years, Williams was a dominent force on the Album charts as well. He placed nearly 30 albums in the Top 100 and many of these albums remained on the charts for a year or more! Andy Williams was also the host of his own highly rated variety show on NBC for nearly a decade. You might be surprised to learn that \"Moon River\" was never released as a single. Rather it appeared on Williams' phenomenally successful 1962 album \"Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes\" which remained on the Billboard Album charts for an amazing 176 weeks. \"Moon River\" would become Andy William's signature tune.

{"text":"Lemmy has had his share of self inflicted health problems as of late, cancelling shows due to exhaustion and respiratory difficulties.  Yes, he brought it on himself over the years, but we still love him for being the most unapologetic and vital rock and roller in heavy music today.  \"Aftershock\" was a scorcher, and some thought it may be the swan song for the band, but Motorhead pull a huge surprise and give us a new album that's even tougher and blasting with \"Bad Magic\", not just a damn good album to add to the canon, but one of the best rock and roll albums of the year.\n  That's important:  rock and roll.  Lemmy gets it.  He is possessed as are Micky Dee and his long time guitar foil Phi Campbell, the lineup that are as legendary as the \"Ace of Spades\" cast of yesteryear, with the spirit of rock and roll.  To be anything less than fast, loud and abusive is sacrilege in Motorworld.  No cut stands out, but neither do they bring the album down.  It's a slugfest from start to end, and it's the end tune, a heavier than hell cover of the Stones' \"Sympathy of the Devil\" that \"Bad Magic\" closes with.  Lemmy and Co. do a great job, as they did with \"God Save The Queen\".  There's a believability here that makes you think perhaps he is the devil, and he is much more menacing than Mick Jagger, although you have to give him credit for coming up with a song that daring for its day.\n  Once again Motorhead teach the music world how to do rock and roll the right way.  There may be loving tributes but there will never be an equal.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"If you are not familiar with Jack Johnson, then this is a real good album with all good songs. If you are familiar with him, then this is a fantastic work by a continuously growing artist.\n\nTo appreciate Jack Johnson, you must get to know him, you must get to know his personality. This guy is a real nice person, a mean A REAL NICE PERSON. His personality is key to exploring this artist because once you understand his lyrics, then you can really appreciate what this is.\n\nJack Johnson loves his wife who happens to be his college sweetheart. He has children and is a doting father. Many of these songs are simply love songs and odes to his wife and kids. That is why he is so beloved...this superstar, this rock star pays homeage to his family. Many of the songs are so personal yet they are hardly sung in metaphors.\n\nThe motivation for this album was the loss of his father. There is elation and there is melancholy, all, what seems to be, addressing life without his mentor.\n\n\"You and your heart\" leads off and is one of the strongest songs. Unusual for Johnson, it is electric and has a strong bottom end. It is among his best works. \"The Upsetter\" is also a strong song, once again all electric and it even has a guitar solo (unusual for a Jack Johnson tune). \"To the Sea\" is a typical bouncy song, something you would expect to hear from a surfer-turned-singer. \"At or with me\" is another electic rocker with a fun refrain of \"uh oh, uh oh, uh oh\" followed by driving rave up on the guitars. It is destined to be a sing along tune when done live. \"No good with faces\" features Johnson's stacatto type, almost rap vocals.\n\nAll the songs on this cd are strong and there is no filler.\n\nI like Jack Johnson's prior works (\"Brushfire Fairytales\" is not even 10 years old yet it is a classic) but one valid criticism could be that most of the songs are in the same key, with the same instrumentation, and therefore, they start to all sound too similar. That problem is eliminated on \"To the Sea\" since Johnson has finally ventured away from the acoustic campfire and diversified his sounds.\n\nJack Johnson was a former national champion surfer that moseyed into music and is now one of the top artists in pop music. His songs are all simply ditties yet he definitely has a flair in writing very catchy songs.\n\nI give this work a big thumbs up.","classification":4,"fold":2}

That very rarely works, especially in R&B when artists like Maze or the great Whitney Houston whom did it very well, because they showed colors can be blossom in R&B. But in pop, that doesn't work so easily. When I first heard Halsey, it really didn't seem like it was anything special. Then, I went back to her music, after I heard one of her songs, which was sampled by Coldplay and Beyonce' for Hymn For The Weekend. Halsey's New Americana was the song they sampled, and listening to it, it was very dark but took a very tough stance on how the younger Americans have not been recognized for the past several years, and with people like Donald Trump whom made them look like there voices never existed. It isn't a bad song, but yet there are other ones that sounded much better taking a stance with he next generations in society around.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"I just picked up the deluxe version of the album this morning, and I'm happy I got it. This album is pretty hot. It's not mindblowing, so if you're expecting the hottest album in years, or if you believe the hype that's been building the last two years... you might be disappointed. If you're like me, didn't believe the hype, but looked forward to the album, you'll be pleased no doubt. The album kicks off nice with 3 Peat followed by Mr. Carter, A Milli, Got Money... All hot songs. Dr. Carter is also real dope. I like the concept and everything. Comfortable with Babyface, produced by Kanye West is dope. Tie My Hands featuring Robin Thicke is one of my favorite songs at this point. The guitar and beat are NAASTY. I love it. That should DEF be the next single. Phone Home is... weird lol. The beat is kind hot, but the hook is strange and the lyrics are iffy. Sometimes he's tight, sometimes it's just WEIRD. It's Wayne, you know. Mrs. Officer is cool, not bad. Let the Beat Build is pretty ill. I like how the beat literally builds throughout the songs and the arrangement changes up. Wayne's good on it, but honestly I was paying more attention to the beat at first, so I gotta go back and listen.\n\nI thought towards the end the album started losing steam. La La is aright with Brisco and Busta. Playing With Fire is aright. Dontgetit is good. The deluxe edition that came with the second disc is ill though. If you listen straight through the album, disc 1 to disc 2 (The Leak), it finishes off strong. Some of the best songs on the album like I'm Me, Gossip, Kush, Love Me or Hate Me and Talk About It. I know. They're OLD. Whatever. They're still hot.\n\nI'd reccommend coppin the deluxe edition for real. The regular edition is good and worth coppin too, but including the second disc with material from the Leak makes it great. I did get the full Leak (not just 5 songs) last year, which was DOPE, but I'm still glad I copped Tha Carter III. If you're a Wayne fan, STAN or not, you should buy it dog.

{"text":"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought \"Cool...this just might work!\" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK\/DENIAL\/ANGER\/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's \"I'm Not In Love.\" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the \"Big boys don't cry\" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the \"I keep your picture\/Upon the wall\/It hides a nasty stain\/Just lying there\/So don't you ask me\/To give it back\" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with \"Under The Milky Way\", \"Life In A Northern Town\" and \"Broken Wings.\" Oh, sure, \"Under....\" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on \"....Town\" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for \"Town\", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for \"Wing\"). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal \"Human.\" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. \"Holding On To Yesterday\" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. \"Baker Street\" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK\/DENIAL\/ANGER\/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. \"Let's Go Out Tonight\" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on \"For The One.\" Much like \"Human\", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to \"Miss You Nights\" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! \"Blue Rose\" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. \"Cry\" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S\/D\/A\/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (\"You've got to cry\/And surrender to it tonight\/Time alone\/Won't heal your wounds\/It just makes you numb\"), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with \"Imagine\", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"As expected KSE release another solid album. With the release of Disarm the Descent, the big story was the return of former frontman Jesse Leach. The album quickly became a favorite among many fans and was a big success for them. Now make no mistake about it, Disarm is a solid effort by the band. Personally though, I wasn't too big on the album. The second half of Disarm wasn't nearly as strong as the first. It just felt a little uneven and it wasn't as much of a return to form as people made it out to be.\n\nMoving on to Incarnate I have to say that overall I am happy with this album. It doesn't quite reach the highs of the previous album, but it feels a little more balanced as a collective whole. The downside is a few tracks blend together and are actually not as long or fleshed out as they could've been. And yet again there's a noticeable lack of guitar solos and varied arrangements. I would recommend it to long time fans, but if you're a new listener you'd be better starting with their classic album, Alive or Just Breathing.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I've been checking out this guy back as far as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Aijuswanaseing\/dp\/B000051Y10\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aijuswanaseing<\/a>&nbsp;days. Honestly,from each album to the other I found his music to be a tad uneven to the ears;on the edge of brilliant one moment,hardly worth mentioning the next. It's one of the reasons I haven't really checked out a lot of new music in general until the last few years. Being an album listener in general...a few good songs don't usually hold water for me. Sure maybe growing up on all that 60's,70's and early 80's music did spoil me to a degree. It did many of us. But whatever the case I respected this mans musical vision and wanted to hear him grow into himself. With his wide range of influences-from the kind of old school music that inspires hip-hop\/R&B and neo soul to that same music inspired BY older music itself he does create an excellent full circle perspective in how his music deals with the past,present and the future.\n\n  Now truth me told:this album really gets things off to a strong start with two of it's strongest cuts. Featuring Swizz \"Mr. Alicia Keys\" Beatz \"Anything\" is a terrific song,a modern day revival of early 80's post disco \"boogie\" that's both funky and electronic enough to keep a lot of magic in the music. \"Single\" takes a similar if somewhat more subdued approch to the same idea. Aside from the 100% Sam Cooke late 50's R&B\/pop sendup of \"Love Contract\" other songs such as \"Sayido\",\"Silver & Gold\",\"Backtowhere\",\"Waitingstill\",\"Dowehaveto\" and \"Befriends\" take a kitchen sink attitude towards the production-he throws acoustic soul,pop,funk and some modern hip-hop ideas into it but all with a very clear focus. And that goes for the lyrics to,especially on the latter song mentioned where Musiq is dealing with his feelings of love for someone being just as important as her insistance they \"are just friends\". He shows sensativity AND confidence in his love songs,something of a lost art with so many like him looking to be hyper aggresive or plain spineless.\n\n  The album ends again on a high note with \"Likethesun\",a combination of 80's electro funk and old school hip-hop sounds showcasing the \"video game\" production style along with the orchestrated synth washes for a sonically dramatic and musically satisfying combination. It's matched only by the great passion expressed in the lyrics. Turns out here Musiq has a really good program of music in regard to consistancy and vision. He's not going out of his way to appeal exactly to any particular type of audience. He's just pulling together all the best qualities of his music,lyrics and songwriting and putting it out on the table for all to hear. That way he doesn't miss anything or anybody. Trying too little with ones music can indeed force you to miss the mark. But trying too hard to make music \"all things to all people\" can be equally as problematic. In this case that balance is achieved and then some. So far 2011 has been an excellent year for R&B of all different sorts. And if that little trend continues........I do see a strong rebirth to come.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I remember the first time I heard Black, from the first album on the radio.  The radio scene at that time had become so stale and boring filled with sissy alt rock bands posing as rock bands that a song with some actual teeth to it stood out amongst the audio fecal matter that was late 90's radio rock. Since getting their first album I've followed this band and they've been one of my favorite bands to come out over the past 20 years. I even have most of their bonus tracks, b sides and soundtrack songs, except the rap influenced stuff which wasn't my thing.  But honestly I think they're running out of ideas.\n\nI loved 2010's Cold Day Memory at first, but as time went on I found that love wore off and now the album is only ok.  Black out the Sun is one of the most forgettable albums I've ever heard, I seriously tried really hard with that one and now we have Kill The Flaw.  The songs just aren't there anymore.  It's not that the material on here is bad.  It's just not memorable.  There are no catchy choruses, no memorable guitar riffs just nothing that makes me want to keep comong back.  Honestly I love a lot of their non album tracks more than these songs, or the songs on the previous album.  The sound is toned down and softer, kind of like Cold Day Memory, and the songs are very basic.  The vocals still sound good, and he has an awesome voice.  The band still has talent.  It's just that their songs have become stale to me.\n\nThe album opens with Thank You, which is a pretty solid track.  My only real complaint is I feel the guitars in the verses should have been heavier.  I'd also have sped up the chorus, kind of takes away from the momentum of the song.  But still it's a nice track.  Death Dance is also ok, one I do enjoy but don't really remember much.  The title track and bonus track have their moments and Letters has started to grow on me a bit, but that's about it.  One song has a cool acoustic part, with nice guitar work and a nice drum beat but I feel the slow electric section, when the electric guitars kick in, ruin the pacing of that song.  That part should have been faster too.  Other than that nothing really stands out.  Like I said these songs aren't necessarily bad, in fact there isn't a bad song on here.  They just aren't memorable and don't make me want to come back.  I could listen to tracks 1 and 2 and then stop and be perfectly fine.\n\nStill the album is getting mostly positive reviews, of course on here it's amazon so most albums do, but I still recommend listening to it before getting it.  It's not a terrible album, but these guys are better than this.  If you like the 2 previous albums then you'll probably like this, but I just can't get into this.","classification":2,"fold":2}

I think I'm leaning towards no. Go listen to a few songs for free then decide. I'm picky about how I spend, so I'm not recommending. I like a few songs but to purchase all songs, verses I'm going w purchase a few songs. I'd go w purchase a few songs.

{"text":"This is my favourite Iron Maiden album tied with Number Of The Beast. This showcases a very mature and more progressive Iron Maiden, which was certainly a big change in direction. The synths were pretty controversial at the time, but I think they work brilliantly. Somewhere In Time, despite being recorded in the 80s (and sounding like it), has a very spacey, futuristic feel to it.\nThe music is well structured, the melodies are great and the lyrics are well thought out (compared to most metal bands at the time). Tracks like Caught Somewhere In Time and The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner are amazing..., they're all great! The only thing I regret about buying this album is that I didn't buy it sooner.\nThis is a great album. I don't care who said it was ... (one person even said that it was as bad as \"No Prayer For The Dying\"). I love this album, and when I first got it it refreshed my love for Maiden's music where even Piece Of Mind didn't when I bought that a few months before. This album shows a real sense of maturity and progression. Don't get me wrong, I like thier older stuff as well, but many bands have either produced a string of albums that sound exactly alike or they've changed for the worse. However, just when Maiden thought that they couldn't top Powerslave, they release this - and it doesn't just sound like an improved version of Powerslave! It's probably Maiden's most most unique album in terms of its sound. Fantastic.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"After appearing on Bloodbath's debut EP, \"Breeding Death,\" and a full-length, \"Resurrection through Carnage,\" Opeth mainman Mikael Akerfeldt left the band, and they did an album with Peter Tagtgren on vocals.  Tagtgren then left and Akerfeldt returned for the EP \"Unblessing the Purity.\"  Despite his return, these four songs don't sound much like the style heard on the first two releases.  All four tracks are more aggressive and brutal, faster, and less melodic, and they mostly shed the buzzsaw guitar sound that basically mimicked early Entombed and Dismember.  At times, like on \"Weak Aside,\" this EP has a greater influence from Morbid Angel and Florida death metal than the early Swedish death bands, foreshadowing where they'd go on the follow-up full-length \"The Fathomless Mastery.\"  It's fitting since Bloodbath started as a tribute to the classic era of death metal's popularity, and Akerfeldt has always made it known that Morbid Angel was a big influence on some of his early Opeth albums.  Being just an EP, each song can be called a highlight, but if you don't get a kick in the gut when that ridiculous groove in \"Mouth of Empty Praise\" breaks down, you're just being stubborn.  All four of these songs are incredibly fast, uncompromisingly heavy, and celebrate the Bloodbath tradition of honoring the forefathers of the genre with fresh, new songs that recall the glory days of the early '90's.  If you're into devastating brutality, you should enjoy \"Unblessing the Purity.\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

It's Irish influences are front and center and there's a hard rocking feel to it that always gets me pumped up. The only slight distraction is that the words aren't so much sung as screamed. I don't mind a bit of yelling in a song when it feels right, but personally I prefer if it's reserved for only key parts of the song rather than every point at which there are lyrics. So it's not a song you can sing along to, but you can certainly drunkly scream along to it.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"After they achieved international prominence for help ushering in the folk music\n  revival in beginning of the 2010s, Mumford And Sons had stunned the music world\n  in 2015 when they released this rock-oriented folk-rock album when it was met with\n  controversy and mixed reviews upon its official release, but they managed to retain\n  there structural dynamics and folk-rock virtuosity.  Wilder Mind is too quintessential\n  and well-executed to not to like or feel disappointed, you will find the artistic change\n  to be a satisfyingly sonic listening experience performed in exquisite splendour and\n  vitality-driven results.  Beginning with the vigorous opening track Tompkins Square\n  Park, the track set proceeds on other fascinating new songs like Believe, The Wolf,\n  Snake Eyes, Just Smoke, Broad Shouldered Beasts, Ditmas and Only Love, where\n  demonstrate a set of utmost solos on rock instruments compared to their trademark\n  acoustic-based sound.  Produced by Aaron Dessner (who produced hits for Sharon\n  Van Etten and The Lone Bellow), whom the band credited for fostering an inclusive\n  environment without limitations, they band aims for a stadium-size rock sound done\n  with careful timing and self-determination where they combine the arena rock of U2\n  and The Dave Matthews Band, which permeates the albums controversial success.\n  Given that level of stagnation, Wilder Mind, for better or worse, will not change your\n  opinion of Mumford And Sons, where unlike the radio-friendly folk music which they\n  perfected well, they intended to push to broaden there horizons for something new\n  or special, which makes it a deeply challenging and unforgettable labour of love.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I've been a big Nickelback fan since \"The State\" was first released about 4 years ago. I loved it, and when \"Silver Side Up\" came out, I loved it even more. At that point, I figured the band had already hit their high point, and anything else they'd put out would probably only be just ok. Well, after picking up my copy of \"The Long Road\" last September, I was pleasantly surprised. I really wasn't expecting too much out of this album, but at the end of every song, I found myself saying \"YEAH!\" The first single, \"Someday\" is a great song, but for those that thinks it's a watered down version of \"How You Remind Me\", listen to the rest. \"Figured You Out\" is also a good song, however, I don't think it's a good choice as a single. \"Feelin Way Too Damn Good\" is the next single, and again I have to say I love the song, but it's not a good choice as a single. The album's best material is found on tracks like \"Believe It Or Not\" and \"See You At The Show\". It doesn't stop there though, \"Flat On The Floor\" and \"Because Of You\" are probably some of the heaviest songs the band has ever written. There's not one bad song on this album! I'd say it's at least as good as \"Silver Side Up\" if not better. So I urge you to pick this up right away! However, if you have the means...get the limited edition version which features 3 bonus songs: \"Learn The Hard Way\", \"Yanking Out My Heart\" and \"Saturday Nights Alright\". Also good songs!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Jaheim's (J.Hoaglan) sophomore album \"Still Ghetto\" (2002) is an uplifting album to enjoy. Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful, soulful voice which shines through on this release. Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee (formerly of Naughty by Nature) looking after alot of the production on this. The lead single is the inspirational \"Fabulous\" which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times. I like this track, The Rayne's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track. Next two tracks are standout, \"Diamond In Da Ruff\" and \"Put that Woman First\" are about appreciating ones lady. Other early songs like \"Me and My B****\" and \"Let's Talk About It\" follow through well. \"Long as I Live\" is about real love, marriage and commitment. Jaheim goes real deep on \"Everywhere I Am\" a beautiful tribute to his mom, a song where you can really feel his genuine love. Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on \"Beauty and a Thug\". Slow love song \"Special Lady\" is another track I like. A few tracks particularly the ones at the end- are more filler material for me. However the majority of the tracks are memorable with good reply value. \"Still Ghetto\" is another Jaheim album to enjoy, one I recommend checking out.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on \"Thank You\" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both \"All Around The World\" and \"U Know\" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, \"Vibin'\" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  \"I Sit Away\" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel \"Jezzebel\" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on \"Khilil (Interlude)\" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with \"Trying Times\" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights \"I'll Make Love To You\" and \"Water Runs Dry\".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on \"On Bended Knee\".  \"50 Candles\" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content \"...feels like one of those nights...\"  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on \"Yesterday\" they perform accapella.  If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael, Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or time that you can enjoy for long time.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I had the newest Ashes Remain cd \"What I've Become\" and found out on their website about this cd \"Last Day Breathing\".  I know i'm not a great review writer, but I can tell you from the heart that this is the Real Deal.  I have over 8,000 cds and I put this cd in my top 100.  This cd has everything you can ask for:  Great lyrics, amazing guitar solos, amazing vocals, and the drums and bass add that extra kick to the music.  This cd shows what this band is capable of doing when the big record companies aren't controlling the songs, the sound, and the length of the album.  I know Ashes Remain had to sign with a big label to make it in the music business, but the talking heads at record companies usually ruin the sound of the band.  Now the new \"What I've Become\" is not a bad cd, but all the songs are only two and a half to three minutes long and no guitar solos and the overall sound of the album is a lot like fifteen more Christian rock bands.. \"Last Day Breathing\" is totally original from the first note of the album to the last.  The more you listen to this cd, the more you will like it. IT IS SIMPLY AWESOME!!!!! You can get the mp3 from amazon, but if you want the physical cd, you can get it from the Ashes Remain website for only ten dollars.  This will be the best ten bucks you ever spent if you love great rock with a positive message and fantastic guitar.  Thanks for your time and God Bless You.\n\nPhil Baker","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"It is just so sad that it would've been Whitney Houston's 53rd birthday. Honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years, in the gift of song. That is still just as strong and intimate more than a lot of the joke divas of radio today like Beyonce' Knowles or Rihanna who've cared more about severe overexposure, rather than the natural intimacy and simplicity of the voice within. Whitney Houston had shown that musically for years with each and every original song she did, as well as the covers of the rainbow she made for her own. That is definitely the case with each and every song she did for the movies as well. Her rendition of I Believe In You & Me from The Preacher's Wife is one of my favorite cover songs she had ever recorded. Her rendition of The Four Tops classic definitely was made to her own so nobly. I think of this song for Whitney, just as deeply as any song she had ever recorded for movies like Waiting To Exhale & The Bodyguard. If you have never heard a Whitney Houston song before, well this is one I sincerely recommend you listen to.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012...

{"text":"This is a pretty unique sound. It's got bluesy acoustic guitar riffs mixed with upbeat folksy vocals. You can tell Milsap has gotten influence from gospel music as well, and while that sound doesn't show up here the themes of gospel do at times. It's a good mix. I enjoyed this entire album.\n\n Hades Pleads - This gets the album started right. It's a fast paced song that makes you want to dance.\n\n Pining - Upbeat song with great vocals. It's hard not to start signing along even the first time through without knowing the words.\n\n Morning Blues - Brings the temp down a bit. It's got a very 'Sunday Morning' feeling to it which I think it exactly what Milsap was going for.\n\n Heaven Sent - Really slows things down. This has a strong bluesy vocal sound. The band behind him really helps sell the lyrics with the deep bass drums in the right spots.\n\n The Very Last Day - This is the title track of the album, obviously. This song has a slower beat but a lot of pent up energy. As the song progresses more of the band gets involved and the song just keeps picking up steam.\n\n Hands Up - The tempo goes back up here. The lyrics are all about robbing a store and being a general miscreant. This ended up being my favorite track on the album.\n\n Jealous Sun - This one slows it down again and focuses on the vocals with subtle strings in the background. His raspy voice is perfect for this song. The lyrics are magnificent. It's true poetry.\n\n Wherever You Are - I liked this song, but I felt it was more generic. There was nothing particularly distinctive about it. It's probably my least favorite song on the album, but it's not bad.\n\n You Gotta Move - Opens up with blues harmonica. You kinda can't go wrong there. When the vocals and rest of the band jump in it all goes perfectly with the blues harmonica. So think of a guy playing harmonica in a prison cell....this whole song has that vibe. It's a slow song. It's wonderful.\n\n A Little Fire - Guitar and vocals. I feel like Milsap has gospel music in his background based on the themes of the lyrics. This is the only song that has a gospel sort of sound to it. And yet, it takes that gospel sound and converts it to folk. I don't know how to describe it better. It's musical magic and it's wonderful.\n\n Tribulation Hymm - Similar to A Little Fire. It's got a gospel \/ hymm kind of feel but set to a folksy country sound. This is beautiful music.\n\nOverall I really like Milsap's voice. He can go upbeat poppy stuff with a  folksy sound just as well as he can slow it down and do bluesy stuff.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I love DP, love all versions that their ever were of the band.  Loved Slaves and Masters, House of the Blue Light and Purpendicular.  I thought Steve Morse brought a fresh kick in the butt to this band with Purpendicular.  Abandon had a harder edge to it, and would unfortunately be Jon Lord's last full effort with the boys. Then Bananas and Rapture were both great, but I couldn't help feel they were just by the numbers albums, were nothing was truly memorable but they weren't bad albums.  Now What ?! finds the boys with a fresh energy that you can hear on Purpendicular, but whereas Steve Morse ran the gauntlet on that album, this time Don Airey finds his footing in the band.  Don Airey's keyboard presence on this album, is well, un traditional of any Deep Purple line up or album since maybe Mark II's In Rock.  And while that is definitely not a bad thing, it does sound a bit overdone in this day and age, almost going over the top to show how much Jon Lord is missed to not only the boys in the band, but to rockers and rollers all around the world.  It's beautiful to hear, it's just too bad we are hearing this keyboard prominence after the passing of Jon Lord.  Not to dwindle off on that path, the wit and humor of Ian Gillan's vocals and lyrics are still present, Roger and Paicy still anchor that DP sound, and Steve Morse, I feel, this is his most reserved outing with Purple.  He's channeling the classic sound on this album more than any other album he's been featured on.  A great album nonetheless, it's a stretch to call this their best since 84's Perfect Strangers, or '96's Purpendicular,  but it's definitely more interesting and memorable than Bananas and Rapture.  If your a fan it's yet another evolution in the sound of the Purple machine, pick it up!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"With Last Year was Complicated Nick Jonas offers up a solid collection of well-written, lyrically thoughtful tracks which for the most part reflects great growth and artistic maturity. That said, however, after several listens I think I still prefer his eponymous previous album, on which nearly every song stood out with its own distinct identity or catchy melody, whereas the production on Complicated can be a bit messy at times and often makes it difficult to distinguish one track the next.\n\nNot that there aren't any highlights to make mention of. Champagne Problems is by far the slickest and catchiest track of the set, and who hasn't been able to relate to the heartbreaking frustrations expressed through the balladry of Chainsaw or \"Unhinged\"? With running themes of failed relationships and love gone wrong a newly introspective Jonas really lays it all out there and its always admirable when a young artist  or ANY artist in the landscape of modern pop music, really  chooses to write about subjects important to them, but like I said above, in terms of pure sound theres really not much here which will instantly solidify itself in your brain the way Jealous or Teacher did a couple years ago. Things pick up again toward the end with the optimistic Comfortable, but by track 12 it may just be too little, too late. I also found the album to be way too oversaturated with guest artists for my liking, with obnoxious rap interludes intruding on about half the tracks.\n\nAgain, theres nothing actively terrible about this album, and most fans of R&B flavored pop or light dance music will find it perfectly suitable as background noise. It's just unfortunate that, for as many strides as he has taken with his songwriting, Jonas seems to have taken a few steps backwards in the production department, and nearly selling out completely with all the rap spots and such. Honestly the whole record strikes me as a possible case of too many cooks in the kitchen. So, three stars for what can best be summed up as fun in the moment but instantly forgettable.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Think of any power metal band from the late '80s onward. There's a good chance they were influenced by Iron Maiden's \"Somewhere in Time\" album. Need proof? Take a listen to the long, progressive songs that take on a futuristic, epic feel to them. The synth-styled guitar and bass work alongside the adventurous lyrics. Even the artwork through this entire album presents music that is both beautiful and influential.\n All right, so influence isn't the only thing that makes an album great. However, I think that \"Somewhere in Time\" is, regardless of how influential it is, remains one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. From the larger-than-life opener of \"Caught Somewhere In Time\", we are taken to a futuristic world in the style of Iron Maiden. Where powerful drumwork and amazing guitar and bass melodies compliment ingenious and adventurous lyrics. Take the effects-driven lead guitar riff, wondrous guitar solo and sing-a-long chorus of \"Wasted Years\". Even \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" takes a topic like running and makes it seem so much more bold and majestic.\n Some people may say that adding this tone to classic Iron Maiden may have been a slight mistake on the band's part. This was ironically released in the same year as Judas Priest's \"Turbo\", which had very similar, futuristic-sounding elements to it. Even though this album is generally remembered as being much better, I happen to like both albums.\n What you have to remember is to keep an open mind. Don't you think if a band released the same album over and over it would get tiring? Admittedly, \"Alexander The Great\" runs up a bit short in comparison to the absolute epic of Iron Maiden's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", but that's all right, because the rest of the album is great all the same.\n Other strong points include \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" which features a great, opening bassline and another catchy chorus. A personal favorite is \"Deja Vu\", which seems to be enormously influential in the power metal genre. The driving energy behind the drums, the spacey wah-wah riffing of the guitars, and Bruce's untouchable wailing of \"Feel like I've been here before!\". And it all ends up being classic Maiden with a new twist to it.\n So, some people may have mixed feelings about this album. Me? I think it adds an exciting, new element to an already awesome band. This is personally an album I hold in high regards. In my opinion, if you want more great Iron Maiden and have an open mind, this is something I hope you're really gonna love. After all, Maiden's already known for their incredible musicianship and professional songwriting, what's wrong with taking a little trip through time? Speaking of which, thanks for the time, and peace.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Sparing no expense to work with some of the top people in the music industry, Shambhu set out from California for the bucolic splendor of Vermont to record at the studio of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. To say that the supporting musicians are an all-star cast would be an understatement, and includes bassist Tony Levin, who plays with Peter Gabriel, Eugene Friesen of The Paul Winter Consort on cello, and a host of other top notch musicians who tour with the likes of Santana, Pat Metheny, Ravi Shankar, Yanni, and more.\n\nBut at the center of this luminous universe is acoustic guitarist and composer Shambhu. In his own words, \"My compositions reflect a diversity of musical influences from across the globe, from contemplative to Indian-jazz fusion to contemporary instrumental.\"  All radiating a \"heartfelt feeling throughout.\" This is simply some of the finest music of this type that I have ever heard. And I'm obviously not the only who thinks that, since the album was named \"One of the Best of the Year\" for contemporary music by Common Ground magazine and has received nominations for Best New Artist, Best Album of the Year, Best World Music CD, and Best Acoustic Instrumental CD. A track from this CD is featured on a recently released compilation entitled \"The Gathering,\" produced by Will Ackerman.\n\nOne of the outstanding features of this project is that it is actually a multi-media experience. Shambhu thoughtfully filmed the entire recording process, and in the beautiful accompanying booklet, entitled \"A Guide To The Journey,\" as well as on his website are links for the videos on YouTube, which I found absolutely fascinating. \"Sacred Love\" is a journey well worth taking.","classification":5,"fold":2}

But nothing restrains us here in the future from giving him the respect and accolade he richly deserves. Try Schu, you'll like Schu!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Shakira's music often has just the right beat for dancing\/exercising. I can only catch a little of the lyrics of this song. Something about her life being under his feet ...  and a line about her eyes ... the remnants of my high school Spanish is kind of insufficient to translate, which may actually save the song for me, because the songs of hers that I've heard in English sometimes have unacceptable lyrics. Take, for example, \"She Wolf.\" It has a really great beat, and it's a cute danceable tune. But the lyrics need to be fixed. Anyway, \"Suerte\" is in Spanish, so I can listen to it in complete ignorance of how bad the lyrics might be.  :)","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"It is honestly so sad whenever someone young and talented leaves this Earth so soon, and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music. That has been the case with Whitney Houston. Hard to believe that it has been over for years since she passed away, and I am often reminded just the real beauty of her voice, compared to so many female jokes of today like Ariana Grande and Beyonce' Knowles that have much less than what she brought to the table. That has shown with each and every song Whitney Houston performed and covered. Especially with The Bodyguard soundtrack. Her cover of Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman is a very upbeat and delightful song that still moves me each and every time I hear the song. She definitely drove her soul on the rhythm with each and every note, and made it her own for a generation that still knows music today. If you have never heard a Whitney Houston song before, well this is one cover that I sincerely recommend from beginning to end. Too bad female artists will never ignite the way \"The Voice\" reigned.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"One of the coolest things about a new album by Silversun Pickups is that it reminds you of an old friend who comes to dinneronce again, with even more interesting stories to tell since last time. The Los Angeles-based quartets ever-expanding sound comes accross impeccably on their fourth full-length album, Better Nature which comes out on September 25th via their own New Machine Recordings.\n\nProduced once again by Jacknife Lee (who helmed their previous effort Neck of the Woods), their sprawling cinematic sound pours outward from every track, as evident from the opener Crawling (Better Nature.) Lead vocalist and guitarist Brian Auberts shimmering guitar tone and unique vocal range open things up with a familiar feel but as it progresses, the album takes you to new places unlike any of the bands previous releases. Connection and Pins and Needles pull out all the stops, with tight guitar riffs, in your face drum and bass rhythms, and of course Joe Lesters haunting ethereal backdrops.\n\nFriendly Fires is a slow-paced declaration, followed by lead-off single Nightlights, which is probably the closest track that bares resemblance to anything found on 2012s Neck of the Woods. Circadian Rhythm (Last Dance), the latest single employs bassist Nikki Monningers vocals as she trades verses with Aubert in a prominent manner. The track, as well as much of the album, feels like a hint of an 80s throwbackbut just a hint. Tapedeck, probably the quirkiest of the collection, showcases drummer Christophen Gaunlaos upbeat tempos quite nicely as the song throws the listener all over the place as the track turns off every which way. Latchkey Kids falls back on familiar SSPU territory with straight-ahead musicianship, while Ragamuffin walks you down dark pathways once again with its ominous opening chords. The Wild Ones plays the listener out wonderfully with each musician utilized perfectly, which is really what weve come to expect from this band. With stellar production, new recording techniques, gang vocals, the implementing of Monningers vocals to a greater extent and an overall recharge from the band as they move forwardtaking reign of their own career, this is an album worth supporting.","classification":5,"fold":2}

If you actually look at The Band Perry's first album cover and this, they look EXACTLY the same, which often makes the album boring and very hard to like. The Band Perry may not be so bright with \"If I Die Young\", but at least they actually have what it takes to make redeeming songs. This is a complete copycat. If that doesn't make you think \"WHY IS THIS EVEN A CD\", listen to the music. It's all just crummy bluegrass-influenced country and NO interesting country pop like songs, and actually (like i said) copys the descent bluegrass of The Band Perry.

{"text":"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was true. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.\n\nAnd so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.\n\nThe Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album\n\nThere is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud\n\n\"I'll Be Around,\" \"Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,\" \"One Of A Kind Love Affair.\" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's \"Chick-A-Boom,\" or \"Have You Ever Been Mellow,\" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.\n\nMore proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's \"Honey,\" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into \"One Of A Kind Love Affair,\" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.\n\nTalking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You\" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.\n\nWhat an  ALBUM","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"If you told me a new release was a concept album about suburbia, I'd approach it with a mixture of skepticism and curiosity.  If you told me it was a sixteen song c.d. with this theme, my preconceptions would have leaned to three possible conclusions:  overreaching, just plain hubris, or sheer genius.  After years of elaboration from Supertramp, the bottom line of The Monkees' \"Another Pleasant Valley Sunday,\" as well as Billy Joel's appropriate update, \"No Man's Land,\" what else needs to be said about the banality of life in the suburban world?\n\nFortunately, because it comes from Arcade Fire, and music samples abound, their latest offering `The Suburbs' shouldn't be discounted.  I like to make up my mind on my own, but I have to admit, I'd go no further if it wasn't for favorable reviews by `Rolling Stone' and `The Boise Independent'.  For the former, Arcade Fire's creative prospects are still flourishing; for the latter accolades come just short of this generation's `Sgt. Pepper' or `Nevermind'.  Either way it's an easy bet this offering is on the short list for The Top Ten albums of the year.\n\nArcade Fire prevent themselves from painting into a corner by elaborating this theme well--and, going out on a limb--they're more consistent at sticking to their concept than The Beatles ever were.  The real goldmine, however, comes from the music itself, which is more varied than The Mall of America.  With shivery and shimmering strings, solid piano,  and cascades of synthesizers on select songs, their collection remains solid and interesting.  The texture and sound is outstanding throughout.  To build my own analogy, `The Suburbs' is this summer's `Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'.\n\nThe sing-a-long with the piano feel is given to the title track and \"Deep Blue;\" but they're also rock `n' roll ready with punky moments like \"Month of May\" and \"Empty Room\".  There's plenty--perhaps too many--pensive moments, too, but \"Wasted Hours\" with its 'Pet Sounds' nuances does more than tread water, and the Rickenbacher 12-string Byrdesque folk sound accompanying \"Suburban War\" is supple and smooth.  Synthesizers are awash in \"City with No Children,\" so at least `The Suburbs' music never gets boring.\n\nAs the talking head, Win Butler, seldom runs out of elaborations.  \"Something don't feel right...\/Like a record skipping, I'm a modern man. Maybe when you're older you'll understand.\/Why you don't feel right. Why you don't sleep at night.\"  While his sentiments on \"Modern Man\" may resemble W.H. Auden's  (The poet who coined the phrase, \"Age of Anxiety\".), the soundtrack is indelibly and unforgettably Arcade Fire's.  . Although \"Wasted Hours\" can't be considered the suburban counterpart to Springsteen's \"Jungleland,\" and \"Suburban Sprawl\" (the first) sports a dangerous trend toward snooze control, \"Suburban Sprawl II\" gets right to the point.  While Butler's vocals resemble the next Neil Young, his wife,  R&eacute;gine Chassagne's siren Yoko Ono-esque vocals admirably lament \"...We can never get away from this sprawl, living in the sprawl\/ Dead shopping malls\/ Rise like mountains beyond mountains.\"\n\nThe lectures, sermons, and stories made in between are left for you to investigate (They're about as eloquent as they are unsurprising--although one of the C.D.'s very best songs, \"City with No Children,\" is hardly retread.)  While not all territory is groundbreaking on 'The Suburbs,' the musical variety is enough to fill our shopping bag with enough nuances to keep us satisfied for some time to come.\n\n(Please note that if you are downloading 'The Suburbs' you should put the seconds for no pause if you are burning a c.d. because of the number of segues--indiscernible pauses characteristic of classical music and brought to popular music on The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper'--are considerable.)","classification":5,"fold":2}

Her latest song, Human is a good musical setting, but more could've been brought out from her voice and spirit. It is not yet her best song yet, but at least with all honesty, it is a better song than the wastes of time that Beyonce' and Rihanna have came out with from the past couple of years which have really been more tiring than enjoyed. Still, I do hope there are good songs out soon from Christina out soon. Something that will blow hearts away and say she is more than human.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"It's hard to believe that 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of the Heartless Bastards' outstanding debut album \"Stairs and Elevators\". They followed that the very next year (2006) with an even better \"All This Time\", still my favorite Bastards album. Coincidentally or not, but when the band relocated from Cincinnati to Austin after the second album, their sound began to stray as well, resulting in 2009's so-so \"The Mountain\" album and 2012's okay-but-not-great \"Arrow\" album. After yet another 3 more years, here comes the band's fifth studio album.\n\n\"Restless Ones\" (10 tracks; 41 min.) opens with the hard-charging \"Wind Up Bird\", and as I was listening to it, it felt to me like singer-songwriter-guitarist Erica Wennerstrom was winding the clock back to the band's early years. \"Black Cloud\" finds the band letting it rip, rough and loose, just great. \"Hi-Line\" is the first moment when they band lets up a bit, as if to give us, the listener, a breather. Side B opens with \"Pocket Full of Thirst\", a brooding song. The romping \"Into The Light\" is another highlight on the album. Despite the title, \"Eastern Wind\" is anything but breezy, with a great guitar solo (something the band doesn't do enough, in my book). The album ends with the introverted \"Tristessa\". In all, this is quite the album, and for me it is clearly the band's best since \"All This Time\".\n\nWhen the band was based in Cincinnati, I saw them frequently at shows all over town in every imaginable venue, small and not-so-small. Since their relocation to Austin, they usually make it back here once or twice a year. They are scheduled for two consecutive nights at the new Woodward Theater here later this month. Can't wait for that! Meanwhile, \"Restless Ones\" is a welcome return to the 'classic' Bastards we know and love. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Selmasongs is an extended e.p. (in other words, a little bit shorter than your standard 70-minute cd) containing seven songs, all inspired by a movie in which Bjork played the starring role (Selma). The movie was called \"Dancer in the Dark\", and it was reported to be a painful and difficult experience for her, despite rave reviews and accolades. The experience of acting may have been a nightmare, but Bjork found use for it by allowing it to push her to a new level of emotional creativity. Throughout, Bjork connotes the playful, but portrays the dramatic.\n\nBjork apparently has access to a bottomless pit of creative ideas. Her vistas appear to be boundless, using virtually everything to aid her vision - synchronized factory noises, onomatopoeia, trains, orchestras - who else could claim Catherine Deneuve and Thom Yorke as guest vocalists on the same album? Bjork is contemplative, but she remains somebody who makes lemonade out of lemons. I haven't seen the movie...yet...so it's still difficult for me to understand the lyrical significance of a song titled \"107 Steps\". While the movie will clarify this further, I'm sure, I'm interested in Selmasongs solely as a listening experience. Its atmospherics are as visual as any projected image, so you can almost see each song as presentations of an image. Purportedly, Bjork's character was blind, so it's significant that this music is so visual in its presentation. The song \"Scatterheart\" is a focal point - lush, gorgeous, expressive - along with the dreamily optimistic \"In the Musicals.\" The orchestration is remarkable throughout, too. It provides brilliant colors for the odd melodies of the album's opening and closing theme (\"Overture\", \"New World\"). Based on this soundtrack, I can't wait to see the movie.

{"text":"Back in 2003, someone apparently thought it was a good idea to bring the powers that were Mary J. Blige and P. Diddy back together, in hopes of re-creating the magic of their earlier works. Well, they were wrong. By no means was the result, Love & Life, a terrible album; however, almost any fan will agree that it's Mary's--for the lack of a better term--worst work to date. Yes, there were some great moments, but most of it was uninspired with some pretty lazy production, courtesy of Diddy. The disc barely went platinum, making it her lowest selling studio album by far. The ever-consistent woman who seemingly could do no wrong made a slight misstep. That's what made 2005's excellent release, The Breakthrough, such a pleasant surprise. With the huge success of \"Be Without You,\" the album's triple platinum status, its record-breaking first-week sales, and its eight Grammy nominations, it proved that Blige was on top once again and wasn't going anywhere. Two years later, she is back with Growing Pains.\n\nFrom the photos, to the lyrics, to the themes and overall sound, Mary J. is definitely getting her grown woman on. Now a wife, she speaks with brutal honesty and maturity on serious relationships. They involve work, conflicts, disagreements, dependency, compromise, pain, passion, effort, and love, of course. Although it is a beautiful thing and brings much joy to people, to quote her, \"it ain't all roses.\" I have read numerous reviews, from proffesionals nonetheless, that simply dismiss some of the lyrics as \"preachy,\" but I would have to disagree. Mary is a woman who has clearly been through many trials and tribulations in her life, and she just wants to share her wisdom and knowledge of the world to her large fanbase, who could most likely benefit from her viewpoints. (If these reviewers really can't hear these true-to-life statements without cringing, then it's probably time they put themselves in check!) The pictures in the album's booklet show Mary keeping it classier than ever.\n\nThe stunning back cover shows Mary sitting atop a cabinet of old vinyls. The only vinyl cover that you are able to decipher is Diana Ross' 1981 album, Why Do Fools Fall In Love. It is most likely just a plain coincidence, but it speaks volumes of Growing Pains. This album has the major crossover appeal that Ross possessed back in the day. While Pains will not alienate her solid fanbase that was built upon her original hip-hop\/soul (which is still very present), each track, especially \"Come To Me (Peace),\" contains a slight change in sound that could let them be comfortable on almost any radio format, not just simply R&B. This could be due to some fresh producers and songwriters that have shown much promise recently, such as Ne-Yo, Tricky, The Dream, Jazze Pha, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, and the Neptunes, among others.\n\n\"Work That,\" as heard in the iTunes commercials, is a great choice for the second single. It is upbeat, inspirational, and infectious. The production by newcomer, Theron Otis Feemster, is simple and melodic, but it suits the song perfectly. On this, and a few other select tracks, Mary has a new swagger in her delivery that almost makes her sound like an MC. \"Grown Woman\" is another example of this. Over the hard-hitting and grungy hip-hop beat, she exudes confidence and pride in her womanhood. \"Stay Down\" speaks on marriage and how \"sometimes when we fight\/ it don't seem like God's desgin\/ but... I promised I would stand by you.\" My favorite line appears in the chorus, when she begs her man to \"stay down\/ we're almost to the very best part.\" The production, by ingenious Bryan-Michael Cox, complements the emotion and triumph in Mary's strong vocals. \"Roses\" finds her nowhere near being preahcy; it's about those days when you want to be left alone and quite frankly, your lover just fans the fire. In between verses, she speaks, venting her emotions. On \"Talk To Me,\" she urges her man to communicate his feelings over an Emotions horn sample, casuing the track to have a very nostalgic, old school soul feel.\n\nWhile this album is excellent, it is not flawless. Ludacris' guest appearance irritates me and almost ruins the great \"Grown Woman\" for me. His verse, while not terrible, is a bit vulgar, putting him and his supposed grown woman's bedroom business all out there. Lines like \"we some Stairmasters\/ I make her get her exercise\" seem to contradict the classiness that Mary maintains throughout the rest of the track. \"Shake Down\" sounds a bit too much like something Mariah Carey would record. (I love Mariah, I just think that it's not like something Mary would do.) It's not a bad track, though. \"Just Fine,\" oddly chosen as the lead-off single, is a song I can take or leave depending on the day and my mood. \"Till the Morning,\" however, is my least favorite track. The Neptunes' production and writing has become very bland, stale, and predictable to me by this point in time. The song sounds like Kelis-lite during her Kaleidoscope era. The bridge is good, but that's pretty much all I enjoy of the track. \"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\" is a musically very good, but the whole I'm-just-like-you-even-though-I'm-a-celebrity thing is getting pretty tired. \"What Love Is\" is also exceptional, but lyrics like \"it feels like joy\/ it feels like pain\/ it feels like sunshine\/ it feels like rain\" are undeniably clich&eacute;.\n\nThe bottom line: It is not perfect, but Growing Pains is still a darn good album. Her vocals are on point, the production and songwriting is top notch, and the lyrics are mature and real. Growing Pains has a slightly new sound that will most likely lead to an even bigger crossover than The Breakthrough caused. Still, even her fans from the beginning will feel satisfied. How does she do it? It's a mystery. Mary J. Blige is a truly special and talented grown woman.\n\nKey tracks: Grown Woman, Stay Down, Roses, Fade Away, Talk to Me, Work That.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Alanis repeats the same mistake each time an album others is out. She tries to say too much in too little time. On her last effort, 17 songs had thousands of words, but it's ok then cos some of the songs were really amazing and feature a more matured production, featuring a diverse Indian sound, electronica, and dance\/rock.\n\nOn Under Rug Swept, the decision to release Hands Clean as the first single still goes to show how much she intends to reach the masses with a rather radio-friendly track. Elsewhere on the album, 21 Things might sound like a nice edgy guitar-rock track, reminiscent of her Pill days. On Narcissus, Alanis works her voice into a melancholic winner and brings out the emotional depth in the song. The danger of Alanis goin with it alone is that she oftens get into a self-obsessed mode where she waxes lyrical but often ends up deep within herself that alienates her listners. What's she trying to tell us? By the time you get through with Alanis, you'll be as vexed as our rock princess.\n\n the best track here must be the concluding track Upotia, that features a strip-down, nearer to acoustic sound. On this album, Alanis does score by not over-using her voice to a screech.\n\nNot a terribly fabulous album but nonetheless true to its roots. Not likely a 15 million seller but will just do well. Overall, a controlled delivery as always but too many things to say in too little time.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"As I have bought these Gold collection cd's I have been disapointed beyond belief. The Aerosmith one had no 1970's material, the bands best era, what up with that, and all the others are just well not good at all!\n\nOn with Creams gold. Cream is one of rock and rolls all time biggest, best, and most influential bands of all time, and as time goes on the bands legacy only seems to grow! As generations past new ones seem to discover this band more and more. So its easy to understand how you could make a bad best of by Cream because of how many important songs that band made, but Gold hit the nail on the head.\n\nNot only doe this collection cover the bands big hits like 'Sunshine Of your Love' 'I Feel Free' 'Strange Brew' 'Im So Glad' and 'White Room' but they also put the real classics here like 'Badge' 'SWALBR' 'Tales Of Brave Ulyssis' and 'World Of Pain' which is amazing because those are the bands best songs and they often get left off of best of's and its a real let down, but once again the Gold collection came through here and delivered the goods, and boy did they deliver them right!\n\nAs I sit and think about what this collection could have to make it better im cant think of anything, usually I would say maybe a few live tracks, but here you get a whole nother disc dedicated to live material which is great here because live performances is what Cream was known for, so no complaints there.\n\nAs far as im concerned this is the best Cream collection out there, with out the box set anyways, so if you want to get into Cream this is the way to go!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I think this is a really good album. I wasn't all that impressed on first hearing, but I have been playing it a lot (I had the good fortune to receive an advance copy) and it has grown on me hugely. It is a pleasure to listen to and there is real musical quality here.\n\nPlant these days is much more in Raising Sand mode rather than full-on Zeppelin blazing. He is subtle and controlled (although there is still plenty of power there when needed) and I think this makes him a very fine singer indeed. He brings genuine depth to this material which is pleasingly varied, with elements of blues, Celtic music, rock, Bluegrass, gospel and various African styles all evident. It is very rhythm-driven with percussion shaping almost every song, but it's very well done and never becomes tedious or samey.\n\nThe Sensational Shape Shifters are simply brilliant, playing their variety of instruments with real virtuosity. They complement and incorporate Plant's vocals beautifully, helped by impeccable production which to me makes this album shine with beauty, excitement and interest throughout. Rainbow and A Stolen Kiss, for example, are simply lovely in their own ways while Up On the Hollow Hill is modal, rhythmic and hypnotically involving. I don't think there's a duff track on the album and some are quite wonderful.\n\nThis is a work of depth and maturity with fine songs, musicianship and production which I think has the quality to last for many years. Warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"There was a funny moment in the 2002 Wilco documentary \"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\" where Jeff is egging on his then 3 or 4 yr. old son Spencer who is air-drumming to \"Heavy Metal Drummer\". Now years later, Spencer is 18 and Jeff has 'recruited' him to a project\/form a band called \"Tweedy\". This is of course not the first 'solo' record (even if it's a duo) of Jeff Tweedy. Ironically the very same week that Wilco's long-delayed \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\" album was released in the Spring of 2002, also saw the release of Jeff Tweedy's very first solo album, \"Chelsea Hotel\", an outstanding instrumental soundtrack for the movie of the same name (still available here on Amazon).\n\n\"Tweedy\" (2 CDs; 20 tracks; 72 min.) starts off with a bolt out of the blue sky, the short but powerful \"Please Don't Let Me Be So Understood\", an all-out rocker with the clever wordplay on the song of the same name but ending with \"Misunderstood\". From there we go on a varied journey, where Jeff explores different moods and soundscapes. \"Diamond Light Pt. 1\" is a 6 min. epic, off-center tune. Then there is the touching \"Pigeons\", a reflection on fatherhood, where Jeff croons \"Now that you're older\/Now that you're grown\/Now that you're getting to know the unknown\". On CD2, the songs tend to be a bit shorter, and not as off-center as CD1. \"Summer Noon\" is about a beautiful as anything on here (sounding like classic Wilco, frankly), and the song was included appropriately in the movie soundtrack of the recent masterpiece that is \"Boyhood\". Jeff plays just about all of the instruments on this album, except drums and percussion of course. Spencer's drumming sounds top-notch to me. A special kudos as well for the packaging of the CD: a lush double fold-out, and on top of that containing a nice booklet with the lyrics of all the songs and family pictures, including Jeff's wife\/Spencer's mom Suzy, whose nickname Sukierae is the name of the album.\n\nI got the CD a couple of days ago and have been playing it non-stop. As by coincidence, while I was driving in to work today, I heard an excellent interview on NPR's Morning Edition of Jeff and Spencer, in which Jeff mentions with tender and pride that his nickname for Spencer is \"Genetic Material\", and that, despite the circumstances in which the album was made (Jeff's brother died; Suzy battled cancer), there is a lot of joy in this album and that \"Sukierae\" is NOT a sad album. I have seen Wilco in concert many, many times over the last 15 years. I can only hope that Jeff and Spencer will find their way to\/close to Cincinnati, so that I'll get a chance to see how these new songs resonate in a live setting. Meanwhile, \"Sukierae\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"There are just so few singers that today have been timeless because of the sophistication of the voice alone. Hard to believe that so many of them from Soul & R&B music have passed on too young. Unfortunately, it has been over a decade since Luther Vandross tragically passed away, and so far no one has been able to really shine based on the sophistication of the voice alone. There has never been a soulful singer from today's music that has not even been able to scratch the surface from the soulful voice Luther Vandross left behind when he passed away from complications of a severe stroke he suffered in 2005. One of Luther's last songs Dance With My Father is definitely a brilliant classic that still shows a whole lot of heart for a father whom passed on when a child is too young, and all he prays like his mom is to see the light from his deceased parent's eyes again. It is just one of those deep songs I will always think of Luther Vandross for, because Luther really gave his heart on this song. If you have never even heard a Luther Vandross song before, this is sincerely one to recommend going to.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":2}

She has became so much of a product, that sadly the quality of her voice has died. That has shown on the tracks with her self-titled record and the lagging voice she has shown in songs. Her latest single Mine, the collaboration she has done with Drake doesn't actually deliver in voice and heart. Unfortunately for her work with Drake doesn't actually deliver in a soulful voice, and feels something more like she has tried to deliver an rhythm that make her completely sounds like a Alicia Key's song.

{"text":"\"Inner Circle\" is a fascinating collection of thirteen original pieces by Peter Calandra, a composer best-known for his scoring for film and television. Piano and keyboards are prominent in all of these pieces, and Calandra is backed by an impressive list of guest musicians on an assortment of instruments. I think the most remarkable thing about this album is that Calandra is so comfortable with and adept at such a broad spectrum of musical styles that range from classical to jazz to pop and fusion. Calandra's goal with \"Inner Circle\" was \"to touch the listener's heart, to strike an emotional chord, while also exploring my wide-ranging musical interests.\" Mission accomplished! \"Inner Circle\" is Calandra's fifth independent release, and should bring him out of the background and into the spotlight. In addition to his soundtrack work, he has also played keyboard for an impressive list of Broadway productions and has music published and playing in sixty countries around the world. He has also played and recorded with the New York Pops Orchestra and artists that include Dee Dee Bridgewater, Aretha Franklin, and Allen Ginsberg.\n\n\"Inner Circle\" begins with the intriguingly-titled \"Clyde And The Pearl,\" a jazzy confection that features Calandra on percussion, keyboards, and piano. Upbeat, rhythmic, and very catchy, it's a great opener! \"Dine's Waltz\" goes in a different direction with a light and very graceful dance for piano and strings. The first movement of \"The Wayfarer\" reminds me a bit of early Yanni with darkly intense strings and a powerful pulse that evolve into a sweet interlude that returns to a variation on the original theme, adding haunting, passionate vocals - one of my favorites! \"Better Angels\" is an evocative piano solo that relies on deep emotion rather than fancy finger-work to convey its message. The title track begins as a duet that mixes a sparkling keyboard with silky-smooth strings - very beautiful. \"Faith\" is another favorite. It begins as a soulful duet for oboe and piano and easily transitions into a chamber work by adding violin, cello, acoustic bass and flute. Themes are alternately serene and more energetic, building intensity all the way to the end. From there, we go to a sweet and tender piano solo called \"So Much To Say.\" To show he still hasn't run out of new directions to take his listeners, \"A Quiet Spark\" is a gently ambient piano solo that comes directly from the heart. \"The Dreamer\" is atmospheric and hypnotic with a single low tone that runs through the whole piece along with keyboard and strings that cast a peaceful, magical spell. The last track is another surprise called \"Chorale,\" which pretty much says it all. Joy Askew overdubbed multiple vocal tracks, singing soprano, alto, and tenor parts and bringing the album to a close with an elegant wordless hymn.\n\nDespite the varied styles of music on this album, it holds together really well and takes the listener on an aural journey. Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Henry Jackman has just jumped out of the plane without a parachute.  Did he do that! Yes, he did!  You can tell he had fun writing this music.  From the opening track, the music is powerful and gripping.  Cap is sweeping the upper deck of a ship and knocking out the bad guys.  On your left, Boom!  I love the pulsing rhythms that he uses with the synthesizer, the opening statement with the brass and drums that sets up the new theme for Captain America; then the strings take over the other theme that gets associated with Cap.  I love the different tempos that he sets up with the drums and synthesizer.  You can clearly hear the new theme in the second track and the triumphant feeling that is conveyed.  I love the patriotic theme on the third track that he uses as Cap reflects on his past and his brother.  Track 5, Fury, is one of my favorites.  It is pretty much all synthesizer with different sounds, pulses, drum shots, and it is intense.  Of course, the on screen visual is intense as Hydra is trying to capture Nick.  Music can make your imagination go in many different directions and Track 6 clearly had my imagination going to the terminator or transformers.  It is a relentless, \"I-am- coming-after-you,\" piece and I will not stop until I get to you.  The Winter Soldier is intense in the film, and he has some kind of bionic hand.  I will not go through all the tracks, but Tack 9, Taking A Stand, is the full rendition of the new theme for Cap that they play at the beginning of the end credits.  It is powerful, driving, and heroic.  Track 13 is strange and funky.  It reminds me a little of a cross between his Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Slayer and X-Men: First Class, which both albums have some great end credit music.  I love Track 15, Into The Fray, which starts out with your more traditional drums going into war, low brass and strings, setting up a menacing theme that gets louder and higher.  He then lets the orchestra and the synthesizer battle it out, like Cap and the winter soldier battle it out.  Musically, they both win in this case.  The longest Track 18, Captain America, is really neat, and Henry puts the new theme through just so many different renditions, moods, and sounds that it is sheer fun to listen to.  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":2}

Nevertheless, he has had some good songs before like Dreamtime and Cab Driver which came out a few years ago. His latest single Eyes For You (Ain't No Doubt About It,) takes on a simple and strong sample of the Hall & Oates classic I Can't Go For That (No Can Do) to a new generation that has never heard Hall & Oates before, or seen him for the first time from his success with his live web show Live From Daryl's House. It actually is a good song, and definitely a step in a better direction that Talking To You (Is Like Talking To Myself) did not show last year.

And I know the guys have skills, but they have weird ways of using them on here.\n\"Out Of Breath\" is a good song, but it sounds just like \"Hanging By A Moment\"; and when you stop to think about it, so does \"Spin\" (but not as much). \"Anchor\" is really overproduced, while the chorus to \"Wash\" could stand to be rewritten. And while I'm talking about the lyrics, Jason tends to say \"All I want is you\" repeatedly in a lot of the songs.\nNone of the songs are bad per se (well, maybe they could've left \"My Precious\" behind), but the songs sound so much like their previous work that it makes you wonder where originality factors in.

While Lady Gaga paid homage to Whitney with Fashion Of His Love for her album Born This Way, nothing will ever replace the smile, joy and love Whitney Houston had with that song, and Whitney will always want to dance with somebody.

{"text":"When Domingo and Pavarotti were young, they stepped into big shoes immediately. Pavarotti's tunning \"Kind of the High Cs\" album left no doubt that a voice of historic moment had arrived on the scene. Much is hoped for from Vittorio Grigolo, who began as a boy alto in the Vatican choir and according to his bio has studied to be an operatic tenor for sixteen years (he will turn 34 next February). But he isn't stepping into big shoes right away. He expressly takes his time, preferring to focus on the music that his light, bright voice is best suited to right now.  Other tenors who grew into Puccini and Verdi from Donizetti and Rossini include Marcello Alavarez and Ramon Vargas, so time will tell.\n\nWhat Grigolo possesses in full is vocal charisma, even at this early stage of power and heft. He sings with ardent emotion, reminding us that by the measure of the late Marshall McLuhan, opera is a \"hot\" medium, not a \"cool\" one.  Add to his virtues a smooth legato, evenness of tone from top to bottom, an easily produced head voice, and an immediately recognizable vocal personality (what opera fans call \"face\"), and it's easy to see why everyone wants Grigolo to be The One.  I'm on board, too. I keep reminding myself that Pavarotti started out in his student days with a small voice, according to those who knew him then. Still, it came as a relief that Grigolo had enough amplitude to sing Rodolfo at the Met and Des Grieux in Manon at Covent Garden. He's not as dependent on the microphone, then, as Andrea Bocelli. He can count his lucky stars that his voice is almost as romantic as Bocelli's -- as witness a myriad young female fans. the rest or us, although we are grocery store cats and harder to please, hear the promise of great things in this debut opera album, too.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Starts quiet and slow. Perky strings & keyboards lead to superior soaring vocal that strains to convey strength & feeling as the band joins in the effort to satisfy & surprise. This is a great song because of the vocal. Love it.\n\nSteps And Numbers by The Appleseed Cast. Vocal a little buried on nothing fancy indie\/emo song that does not offend. Drums & hollow singing lead the song. Okay sound on this 6 minute song.\n\nColors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor. Strong instrumental song with depth & many moving parts to keep you listening. Lie back and enjoy as the sounds wash over you, if you like you'll wanna hear more (they have more). Very nice.\n\nInglend Part3 by Last Lungs. Another strong instrumental with raw edges and neat sound. Like it.\n\nSleep by The Cast Before the Break. Neat Ambient song, great lead singer who roams around his vocal range in front of rowdy band that moves from raw indie to cool ambient. I am really enjoying this sampler. Great complex song that has a few unnecessary lulls (for me) still rocks.\n\nDrifters by The Dandelion War. \"Lavish Atmospherics\" is how their own Record Label(Deep Elm) describes The Dandelion War's new album(includes this song). Describes this 7 minute track well, not for me still very nice song.\n\nTrack 7. The Morning Bus by Dorena. More Ambient\/Atmospheric music. I was going to copy & paste great line from their Record company's web site that describes their music perfectly. Won't let me. You know if you like this genre.\n\nNothing Remains Forever Yet The Future Still Holds Hope by Goonies Never Say Die. I swear this song has the same riff as the previous song although these guys rock the theme, building and layering on more sound, band and imagination. Instrumental song with much more to enjoy. Love it.\n\nFog Is Drowning Us by I Am Sonic Rain. Best band name in a while. Instrumental number that stays awake despite mellow chunks, nothing new, okay.\n\nRed Lightning Child\/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery. Another instrumental track, This sampler has forced me to listen more closely to instrumental songs admit many rock. This is strong busy track, no vocals but pounding collection of band parts that keeps your attention. Never breaks out into hard rock (to me) but easily rides the edge for the whole wave. Very nice, like it.\n\nFinal track, Day After Day by Our Lost Infantry. Identifiable lead vocalist who melds with great band who rock. I am not a fan of pausing the action during anything, song rules so they get a pass. Wall of sound smacking against your face (in a good way), love it.\n\nAmazon genre shows as Alternative Rock, Rock which this free sampler from Deep Elm Records is, however the sampler contains so much more than 2 genres. Not everyone's cup-o-tea, give it a chance, somehow I gave 2 songs 5 stars(Day after Day & Why Aren't I Home?) and 5 songs 4 stars in iTunes. Maybe I was in the mood for something new, maybe this is a brilliant collection of new music & I am smart enough to get it.

Their song \"Video Kid\" was what got me hooked on the band. 4 or 5 years later, I find myself not saying that about the band's latest effort Pins & Needles. I never have been so disappointed in a band until now. Pins & Needles lacks the addictive pop hooks or originality that made me fall in love with them to begin with. I also found a few songs on the new album to be regurgitation of songs like \"Red Stars\" and \"Looking Glass\" from their previous full length album. Not very original IMO. I really did want to like Pins & Needles but sadly I did not nor can I recommend it either. I'll take the new Cylab and Unter Null cds over the new TBM cd any day.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is quite a set! It is a \"VoxBox\" edition. I remember \"Vox Boxes\" back in the 70s. They were low-priced, multi-record \"boxes\" of complete works or substantial works of various composers. This a Vox Box on steroids! All 41 known Mozart symphonies, plus various ones attributed to him with varying degrees of certainty, some actually generally considered NOT Mozart. Many were discovered fairly recently (recent related to Mozart's era). So you will find \"Symphony no. 55\" for instance. The numbering is misleading since these are works of youth if his at all (the Koechel number hints at the correct placement in his oevre). At $5.99, it is an absolute no-brainer. The Mainz Chamber Orchestra is very good, and a good size orchestra for this music. The conductor, Gunter Kehr conducts very spirited and loving performances. At 168 \"songs\" as Amazon calls the tracks, it is astounding. You won't want to download all of them. I listen to them in the Cloud via my Roku box, connected to my sound system. Excellent recordings; must be from the 60s or 70s but have been apparently remastered digitally (not sure, but sound good). There is no downside. HIGHLY recommended\n\nOne tip: if you are bewildered by which symphonies are authentic W.A. (and not father Leopold) Mozart, check Wikipedia under the URL [...] (list of all his symphonies including spurious attributions) AND another excellent Wiki article: [...]","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"While Randy Newman is a musical household name in 2017 - especially with his glorious Oscar-winning Soundtrack work on beloved Pixar films like \"Toy Story\", \"Monsters Inc.\" and more - back in 1972 when he was onto his 4th solo LP for Reprise Records (3rd studio set) - and despite huge industry wide critical acclaim - he couldn't get arrested by the buying public even if he did insult short people or rail against the tyranny of religious zealots.\n\nOriginally released in May 1972 - the American vinyl LP of Reprise MS 2064 was not only ignored but even derided in some sectors - something Newman alludes to and smirks at in the caustic liner notes that accompany this stunning 2002 Rhino CD reissue. Because of course history tells us a different story to the chart indifference he suffered then - \"Sail Away\" is a great album - a masterpiece really - and an early jewel in a very large and long career arc. He is also helped by an impressive array of session players - Ry Cooder, Chris Etheridge of The Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimmy Bond, Wilton Felder of The Crusaders and Milt Holland to name but a few (Randy plays piano and sings). It's lonely at the top indeed. Here are the memos from Simon Smith and his Amazing Dancing Bear...\n\nUK released May 2002 - \"Sail Away\" by RANDY NEWMAN on Rhino\/Reprise 8122-78244-2 (Barcode 081227824426) is an 'Expanded Edition' CD Remaster of the 12-Track 1972 LP with Five Previously Unreleased Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows (41:51 minutes):\n\n1. Sail Away [Side 1]\n2. Lonely At The Top\n3. He Gives Us All His Love\n4. Last Night I Had A Dream\n5. Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear\n6. Old Man\n7. Political Science [Side 2]\n8. Burn On\n9. Memo To My Son\n10. Dayton, Ohio - 1903\n11. You Can Leave Your Hat On\n12. God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)\nTracks 1 to 12 are his 4th album \"Sail Away\" (3rd studio set) - released May 1972 in the USA on Reprise MS 2064 and July 1972 in the UK on Reprise K 44185.\n\nBONUS TRACKS (Previously Unreleased):\n13. Let It Shine\n14. Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong (Studio Version)\n15. Dayton, Ohio - 1903 (Early Version)\n16. You Can Leave Your Hat On (Demo)\n17. Sail Away (Early Version)\n\nThe 20-page booklet is a pleasingly in-depth affair with a Page 3 introduction from the great songsmith himself and a further essay\/assessment pleasantly called \"Of Freaks, Geeks, And God\" by Editor of the Rolling Stone  DAVID WILD. There is even some personalized notes on the five Previously Unreleased outtakes and how pleased Randy is with the sound of the new Remaster carried out by long-time Rhino Records Audio Engineer associate - DAN HERSCH. This is a gorgeous sounding CD reissue - warm and full - as this quietly subdued album has always cried out for.\n\n\"...In America you get food to eat...Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet...You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day...\" You can't really imagine (even now) the impact those opening lyrics to \"Sail Away\". Firstly very few artists would have risked them. Newman isn't casually slagging off America or taking a cheap shot - but he is highlighting hypocrisies and attacking homegrown racists and their simplistic crap all in the same song. The fact that he does all this inside a haunting melody (orchestration conducted by Louis Kauffman) is all the more remarkable. Newman then digs at his own supposed Rock Star lifestyle in \"Lonely At The Top\" - the applause - the money  the after parties. The song was used as a title to a CD Best Of for Warner Brothers in 1987 remastered by Lee Herschberg  a disc I bought back in early days of reissue.\n\nAn uncaring God and our blind allegiance to pie-in-the-sky indoctrination crops up in the sly and disturbing \"He Gives Us All His Love\". The distinctive rattle of Ry Cooder's slide guitar strings comes slinking in on \"Last Night I Had A Dream\"  a song I only half like actually. Speaking of which - his Alan Price hit \"Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear\" dates back to the Sixties and put RN on the songwriting map. But again - I've always admired the song more than I actually liked it. \"Old Man\" is one of the saddest melodies on the album - a tearful farewell by a son to his father - a Dad he clearly dislikes and loves in equal measure.\n\nSide 2 gives us the masterful \"Political Science\" - a song with lyrics that inspire awe and giggles even now  a full 45 years after they were released. The protagonist singer tells of American Generals and Politicians weary of trying to be nice to the world  why bother man - they hate all Americans anyhow. So to Hell with them all and let's drop the big one now (not on Australia though - don't want to hurt no Kangaroo - besides they've got surfing and good weather too). \"Burn On\" is one of the album's secret nuggets - a river in Cleveland suddenly containing magical qualities as a red moon of fire rises in the distance. Understated observation number 424 comes in the shape of \"Memo To My Son\" - as witty and as wise a love letter from a father to a son as you'll ever hear. Like most young Dads - he's struggling with all the joys and terrors a child brings - but there's a simple love in there that's so touching. In the liner notes Newman's fairly dismissive of \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" but I actually think it's beautiful - a mournful 'missus and me' ballad. The ever so slightly perverse \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" tickled many people's fancy (Tom Jones even covered it for \"The Full Monty\" film) - and it's easy to work out why as it plays - the song is witty, acidic and lusty. Buddhists and Hindus join Catholics and Jews on Satellite TV for the seriously harsh \"God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)\"  a nonchalant even disinterested Almighty poo-pooing his creation Mankind as they beg for mercy from plagues and suffering.\n\nYou can't help thinking that the wonderful outtake \"Let It Shine\" was left off the album precisely because it is so upbeat and uplifting - not in keeping with the album's overall moody demeanor. But it's a treat to hear it and \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong\" - fully formed songs that actually deserve the moniker 'Bonus'. As I already liked \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" - a pretty 'early version' of it is alright by me. And the early version of the title song is radically different and fascinating for it...\n\n\"...I hope people like them this time...\" - Randy Newman remarks in the new liner notes (the next LP \"Good Ole Boys\" from 1974 was also reissued in this CD series) - maybe a little mellowed by the years and distance. I'd agree.\n\nI know RN is not everyone's cup of Darjeeling - but his songmanship and affecting melodies\/lyrics warrant your attention  yes even deserve it. And 1972's forgotten and overlooked \"Sail Away\" album is the perfect starting point...","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"If you need to fill holes in your Chopin collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Chopin CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by the one of the greatest Romantic composers of all time.  There are the ballades, the etudes, the preludes, the nocturnes, the mazurkas among others.  These are primarily piano pieces - but oh! what piano pieces!  They are complex, lyrical, sonorous, uplifting, radiant piano pieces that are the signature of Chopin.  No one writes music likes this other than Chopin.  This is music at it's best!  Chopin was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxation, meditation,reading, or as the background for your life.  It's simply beautiful!\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussey.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Forms of poetry are often logos of memes with positive flaws while songs have new kinds of sentences, considering my patience with time as though my eyes are actually the students for these ears under my hair.  Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"There were a few things that made 2009's SIGH NO MORE the breakout hit that it was: music that was stripped down to the basics, lyrics that were sincere and not pretension, and big, big choruses full of melody. The album was a crossover hit, and for good reason - much like the Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons seems to bring a workman-like quality to the songwriting. SIGH NO MORE was incredibly efficient, pouring in emotion into every possible second of the album. Fans of Mumford and Sons' brand of folk\/alternative will rejoice at the band's sophomore release: BABEL is a continuation of the band's sound more than anything else.\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about BABEL is the energy of the record. Produced by Markus Dravs (previously on SIGH NO MORE and Arcade Fire's THE SUBURBS), BABEL is able to capture the same raw energy that the band brings to the concert stage. It all sounds crisp, but it remains dynamic: when Mumford & Sons needs to whisper, BABEL is softly quiet, and when the bands works up its storm, BABEL is loud and fiery.\n\nThe album begins with its title track, and it's a great way for the band to announce BABEL. Marcus Mumford works in biblical imagery and acoustic repetition to create a fiery ballad. The band's lead single to promote the album, \"I Will Wait,\" is catchy and melodic, but the lyrics aren't quiet as sincere as fans have probably come to expect from the band. \"Lover of the Light\" is a highlight of the album -- a song full of twists and turns, nearly every moment is packed with emotional catharsis. \"Hopeless Wanderer\" is full fantastic instrumentation -- perhaps of the best we've seen from the band -- with some incredible banjo and great chord transitions. \"Not With Haste\" closes the album, and it contains a telling lyric: \"I have no time for a cynic's mind.\" With this, Marcus Mumford shows that he's unapologetic for the emotions that he lay bare here. I think it's a lyric that wraps up the entire album, and it's fitting that it occurs so close to the end of the record.\n\nBand leader Marcus Mumford could have taken the band's sound into any direction after their 2009 full-length, and instead of driving closer to pop-music, he's stuck with the same formula that worked for the band previously: BABEL is full of energy, harmonies, sincerity, emotion, and larger-than-life choruses. Fans who enjoyed SIGH NO MORE ought to love this record; those who weren't hooked by Mumford's sound in 2009 probably won't be persuaded by this record though. I would recommend BABEL to fans of the Avett Brothers, the Lumineers, and Old Crow Medicine Show. Essential tracks to download\/sample: \"Babel,\" \"Lover of the Light,\" and \"I Will Wait.\"\n\n(Additional Release Information!)\nThe above review is for the standard edition of BABEL, but it also comes with a Deluxe Edition that includes three bonus tracks. These songs are: \"For Those Below,\" \"The Boxer (with Paul Simon and Jerry Douglas),\" and \"Where Are You Now.\" If you're a fan of the band, I would definitely recommend going with the deluxe edition for these bonuses!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Back in July 2012, the Grateful Dead had a box of 20 reels returned to the vault that filled in some incomplete shows from 6 months from late 1969 into early 1970. The first show featured here is 2-2-70 Fox Theatre in St. Louis, MO. This is the first show without Tom Constanten who also wrote notes from this release. For years, a fragment of this show has circulated starting with the end of Cumberland Blues and cutting off about 3 minutes into Mason's Children. The show starts off with a rocking version of Casey Jones. Standout versions of Mama Tried, Hard To Handle, Cold, Rain And Snow->Black Peter and Cumberland Blues follow. Dark star is great and, while not as great as 2-13-70, goes some interesting places. I particularly dig the quiet part in this one. Saint Stephen->Mason's Children ride the jam home in fine style. Next up, a short but hot Good Lovin' goes into a cool early version of Uncle John's Band. A great version of Turn On Your Lovelight->Not Fade Away->Turn On Your Lovelight closes the set in the best way possible. The We Bid You Goodnight is the perfect encore.\n\nThe next show to be featured is 12-20-69 at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, CA which is the second night in a three night run. I should point out that some of the songs here were rearranged to make the complete show fit without having to fade things out. The show's real running order is: Mason's Children through Cumberland Blues. Then the Dark Star jam and ending with Turn On Your Lovelight (with some rather adult content). As much as I love 2-2-70, I dig this show even more. The mix is perfect with even T.C. turned up in the mix. Mason's Children which made it's debut performance the day before is played to the hilt here. The run of China Cat Sunflower->I Know You Rider->High Time is massive with everyone going off during the transition jam between China Cat and Rider. High Time is beautiful. Me And My Uncle, Hard To Handle and Cumberland Blues are smoking. The run of Dark Star->Saint Stephen->The Eleven->New Speedway Boogie is out of this world. A 36 minute version of Turn On Your Lovelight ends this incredible show. The bonus disc that came with this if you were a subscriber contains a disc full of highlights from 12-21-69.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The lesson here might be to stay away from records produced by Paul Butler. Don't know for sure that he's to blame, but what else accounts for songs that seem to have funky R&B potential buried in them but emerge from the studio mired in a sonic morass of indistinguishable mediocrity?  The second track manages to rise above it on the strength of a killer guitar line and syncopated arrangements that play off it, but much of the rest of the album gives the impression that after exerting themselves on that cut, the band and producer just didn't have the strength, or care enough, to put the same effort into other cuts. And its not like the potential isn't there. The band and producer need to get their Sly and Terrence Trent D'Arby records out, go back to the woodshed and figure out what makes R&B music great.","classification":2,"fold":2}

I really don't get any of this of course.\n\nJust keep in mind that you probably need to understand the comic book character of Jonah Hex in order to grasp the storyline.

Now with Coldplay coming out with a brand new album soon, the big question is does Chris Martin and company still have what made Coldplay so special in sound in the first place, or have they lost it a bit? Well, their latest song, Magic from the upcoming Ghost Stories record isn't one of Coldplay's better songs. It is alright, but not as good what they had before with songs like Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall and Paradies from Mylo Xyloto, but it is at least better than their other song, they've released from the album Midnight, which has great music, but no way of hearing the words to the song well.

The guitars are loud, the sun shines and this is a summertime soundtrack.  At the same time, I have yet to connect with the songs.  The arrangements are all similar with similar tempos.  Unless I'm missing something, no one is actually credited for writing these tracks.  The bonus track \"When I'm With You\" is my favorite, a great tune that sticks in your head, \"I hate sleeping alone.\"  Enjoy!","classification":3,"fold":2}
{"text":"In an era when Hollywood film composers are concocting increasingly complex and convoluted themes that are melodically elaborate but ultimately unmemorable, veteran Hans Zimmer continues to prove himself to be a master of minimalist motifs that leave long-lasting impressions. Such is the case with his excellent score for the equally excellent and unfairly underrated film Chappie.\n\nOnce again, Zimmer demonstrates that less is indeed more, achieving with just a few simple riffs what others fail to do with a preponderance of notes. The result is a masterpiece of percussive, pulse-pounding industrial techno music that brilliantly underscores the film's explorations of sentient technology, unconventional families, human and artificial existentialism, and societal breakdown and chaos.\n\nWhat sets this soundtrack apart, aside from its addictive appeal, is that it is Zimmer's first entirely electronic score in over two decades (with the exception of, as Zimmer puts it, a chap whistling). Zimmer and his team  which includes Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski, and Junkie XL among others and which Zimmer dubs the Chappie Elektrik Synthphonia  created and programmed the music on 40-year-old analog synthesizers.\n\nThe electronic sounds and textures recall Jan Hammer's acclaimed pioneering work on the iconic 1980s Miami Vice TV series, but on a much more grandiose and epic level. Others have also likened Zimmer's score to Vangelis's electronic music for Blade Runner. Like those other scores, the soundtrack for Chappie not only perfectly suits the movie, but stands on its own as a compelling and bold work of art.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Perfect Day, Pretty Good at Drinking Beer, Let Me Down Easy\n\nWith song titles like \"Enjoy Yourself,\" \"The Perfect Day,\" and \"Pretty Good at Drinking Beer,\" Currington has taken a hiatus from those overtly serious and stuffy inspirational material such as his former chart toppers \"People are Crazy\" and \"Good Directions.\"  Rather, following in part in the footsteps of Kenny Chesney, he has decided to take it easy on this album filled with a reposeful groove over tunes that celebrate life in its simplicity.  Thus, taken in such a predilection, \"Enjoy Yourself\" lives up to its album title.  Though these 10 cuts may not offer shafts of life changing insights, it is a fun, catchy and enjoyable endeavor.  In the process of lightening up, Currington has become more accessible and relatable.  This is further enhanced by his wry self-deprecating humor often giving the entire set a hint of edginess.  Helmed by co-producer Carson Chamberlain (who recently produced Easton Corbin's excellent debut), the sparse (and often with a hint of an island) backings befit the tenor of the disc making our listening experience breezy, relaxing and jovial.\n\nIt's no surprise why country radio has devoured vanguard single \"Pretty Good at Drinking Beer\" by elevating it to the penthouse position of the country chart.  \"Pretty\" is a low key charmer that has a way of slipping into our memory with its infectious island-like groove that is made even more accessible with its honest down-to-earth message.  Told in the first person narrative, here Currington admits he's not good at what most men excel (working hard, mowing the lawn, fixing cars et al.) but he's pretty good at drinking beer.  More humorous moments come with Harley Allen and Scotty Emerick's \"Like My Dog.\"  Despite the deprecating concept of comparing his lady to his dog, the song is reek with refreshing humorous lines.  Here's an example:  \"He never says I wish you made more money\/He always thinks that pull my finger's funny,\" this has to be one of the most clever lines in a long while.  On the other hand, album opener \"All Day Long\" may not chart new territory melodically or lyrically, yet this propulsive straight forward love song has an immediacy that will anchor Currington with another hit again.\n\nYet, not everything here is light hearted and frivolous.  Dean Dillon (writer for over 50 of George Strait's cuts) makes an appearance here by contributing \"Perfect Day.\"  Somehow similar to another Dillon co-write \"The Best Day\" (a number one by George Strait), \"Perfect Day\" is a romantic getaway song that will swoon those who like Currington in his more tender moments.  Though the ballad \"Let Me Down Easy\" does not divorce itself from the beach\/island references, it's a serious fiddle-drenched slowie with Currington bearing his soul to his lady.  \"Until Now\" (which is incidentally the album's longest track clocking in at 4:45 minutes) is a slice of 80s pop that is pleasant without much to shout about.  Currington gets gritty with \"Little Lonesome Dixie Town\" a Lee Roy Parnell-esque barn burner with some extended funky guitar riffs.\n\n\"Enjoy Yourself\" is an apt title for this fourth release by Currington.  It's meant to be taken as an sonic escapade - where we can laugh, enjoy and take life easy.  And to this end, the album works.  However, if you are looking for a life changing experience, this disc is not it.  Sure there are a few ballads and some more contemplative moments, but there's nothing really that insightful here.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Super Sessions is a pretty unique album.  First of all I went into the album having very little experience with Mike Bloomfield despite numerous reviews convincing me of the genius and spectacular beauty of Bloomfield's guitar style.  Well guess what?  I DO love the mans style!  It takes a while to warm up to it however, and this is mainly because he plays at such an intense speed that there's hardly any time to catch your breath!  You need to hear it several times in a row to absorb and understand it!\n\nNow when I first heard \"Albert's Shuffle\" a thought occured to me... \"MOVE over Eric Clapton!\" because it sounds almost identical to some of Clapton's heavy blues stuff such as the live version of \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman?\" from his EC Was Here live album.  It definitely falls under the same category of emotionally resonant blues, but regardless who influenced who (though I think Clapton beat him to the punch but I could be wrong, hehe) this song is downright amazing.  Amazing how the guitar solos build through several layers of emotions and THEN to add more excitement, a keyboard solo makes an appearance around the halfway point, and it's a highly melodic keyboard solo at that.  It's an interesting change of pace going from emotional guitar solos to melodic keyboard work.  Perhaps the light touch of jazz after the keyboard solo is a bit much, but then again, this IS 1968 and considering this is what I believe the beginning of the classic years of rock, it's quite a performance.  There's definitely nothing lacking or incomplete about this album overall, that's for sure.  \"Really\" falls under the same category- emotional guitar playing, melodic keyboard solos, jazzy tendencies, etc.  Another high point.\n\nI absolutely LOVE \"His Holy Modal Majesty\".  In fact I actually first heard this song a few years ago on XM radio.  What caught my attention is the bass groove that can be heard during the first couple minutes, and... I had to do a google search to find THIS out, but the musical instrument jamming with the groove is something called an ondioline.  Don't even ASK me how to pronounce that, haha.  It's a high pitched instrument that's somewhere in between an early synthesizer and a keyboard.  Well whatever it is, it would probably irritate the pants off of me if it were to linger a few minutes longer BUT for just a couple minutes?  I can tolerate a couple minutes of a weird instrument!  Heck I can tolerate extreme pain for 2 minutes!  Well then again I've never been tortured.  Don't get any ideas!  :)\n\nAnyway, that bass groove is... WOW!  It makes \"His Holy Modal Majesty\" the best song on the album for me.  It reminds me of something kinky or rather, an Egyptian girl being kinky, hehe.  The rest of the song is occupied with fast-paced blues solos that are pretty melodic for the most part.\n\n\"Season of the Witch\" is the highlight for many people since it's the most familiar song here.  Well truth be told I never thought it was *that* great of a song- a slow-chugging, slightly ominous vocal melody that actually reminds me of Neil Young's \"Down By The River\" for some reason, and the jazziness we eventually experience is... eh, a bit much.  Not a bad song by any means, and this is by FAR the best version of it too.  11 minutes is just too much for my limited attention span I'm afraid!  Though it IS really melodic so at least it has that going for it.  \"Stop\" is based around really cool, melodic blues guitar and keyboard soloing.  Once again, the keyboard work strikes me as immediatley melodic whereas the guitar solos are a bit on the complex side so it takes time to search for the melodic lines.  It's awesome though.  \"Harvey's Tune\" is an atmospheric jazz instrumental.  I love it.\n\n\"Man's Temptation\" is a soulful tune with really beautiful and memorable vocals.  I love the creative inclusion of horns as well.  Yes there's hundreds of 60's songs that closely resemble this one in terms of atmosphere, arrangements and vocals but I don't care- I'll take them ALL!  \"You Don't Love Me\" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect.  You'll know what I mean when you hear it.  It sounds like you're in a spaceship and headed for Saturn!  I wonder if todays technology can recreate this particular sound?  I haven't heard this effect used in any music after the mid 70's.  It must have went out of style.  Anyway this is a blues\/hard rock song similar to Robin Trower's early work, and it's awesome.  \"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry\" reminds me of the mid 60's Byrds with a fast-paced, psychedelic part-country style.  Those feel good vibes are in high quantity here as well.\n\nOverall, it's super duper Super Sessions!  Pick it up for a solid taste of Mike Bloomfield, Stephen Stills and Al Kooper (though for me Bloomfield CLEARLY steals the spotlight).","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Since Musicology Prince has been trying to remind everyone of what was great about Old School. Not just old school Prince but old school soul\/funk and rock and roll. This song is kind of a back to basics but not in a boring way. I've heard a few people say it was bland, it's probably because they didn't really listen to the words or they do not care for the toned down Prince. Everyone in the know knows he is now a Jehovah's Witness so there is no profanity or overtly sexual lyrics (well not like anything he's done in the past). But to dismiss new music because it doesn't sound like the old stuff is silly and really is a way to miss out on great music. While he has definitely reminded us of the old MLPS sound, he isn't trying to just bring back the glory days he's just trying to make sure there is great music out there. In an era of computer generated musical performers who's whole repetoire is more or less just point and click, it's great to hear real music being played by one of Rocks's great masters. It's a definite Rock\/Soul vibe with a small bit of late 70s thrown in. I just hope this is a tease of what is to come, if so the next album should be great. A definitely must have even though the remixes are a bit bland and something that Madonna would probably approve of\/like (but I wouldn't) this is still worth the purchase for the original single version and slightly extended version.

{"text":"RnB\/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, \"Voyage To India\", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.\nIndia Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called \"Growth\" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely true. The second track is an mid-tempo song called \"Little Things\". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a \"call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday\". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes \"Talk To Her\", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and \"talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama\". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (\"It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit\"), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.\nAfterwards comes the mid-tempo \"Slow Down\", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic \"The Truth\", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, \"Beautiful Surprise\", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, \"Healing\" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.\nSubsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, \"Get It Together\" and \"Headed in The Right Direction\". \"Get It Together\" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. \"Headed In The Right Direction\" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes \"Can I Walk With You\" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes \"The One\", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.\nNext comes \"Complicated Melody\" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, \"Gratitude\" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, \"Good Man\", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, \"God Is Real\" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track \"Interested\" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.\nOverall Mark: 3\/5\nAlthough this is still a great album, \"Voyage To India\" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable.","classification":3,"fold":2}

That is definitely the case with her latest single Obsessed, the first from her upcoming album Memoris Of An Imperfect Angel. The song is a far departure from the more upbeat and driven songs Mariah had been known for delivering. It really was made in regards against rapper Eminem for targeting Mariah and her husband Nick Cannon and their relationship. It honestly doesn't feel like a actual beef between the two of them, nor does Mariah score the way she used to. If you really must know, I enjoyed Whitney Houston's title track to her upcoming album I Look To You 10x more, and I absolutely recommend that as a must buy for your MP3 player over Obsessed. Mariah really needs to find better material for her music, otherwise she could windup having a huge flop on her hands. We'll see when Memoris Of An Imprefect Angel comes out in late September.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"In 2001, after a nine year hiatus,  Leonard Cohen was out with his next studio album, \"Ten New Songs\" . Produced by Cohen's longtime backing vocalist Sharon Robinson \"Ten New Songs\" is a beautiful album marked by strong songs in simple but very effective arrangements. Cohen's vocals are familiar, deep and almost in a whispering , though you may feel that they have lost some of their earlier strenght .\n\nSharon Robinson is co-writer on all the songs , and being responsible for all the music, apart from a little electric guitar provided by Bob Metzger, and the very beautiful vocal harmonies, this is very much also Robinsons album, and she is logically depicted on the cover.\n\nMost songs are slow and lingering, full of atmosphere and most have an amazing ability to grow on you every time you listen to them. Several have become concert favorites, such as \"In My Secret Life\", \"Boogie Street\" and \"That Do not Make It Junk\".\n\nI had the pleasure of experiencing Cohen and Robinson during the 2009 tour, where especially \"In My Secret Life\" was a highlight on the long set-list. Among other favorites is the haunting \"By the Rivers Dark\", which in addition to a fine melody has a great lift in the chorus. \"Alexandra Leaving\" is one of the musically more complex tunes, and very much an example of a song that can grow on you. Also the melodic final number \"Land of Plenty \" helps making \"Ten New Songs\" one of Cohen's most successful albums.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is definitely a decent album. But I've heard too much Bjork that is simply better or more creative to be honest. This isn't going to blow away many fans, and it's been done before in many ways. Bjork is one of the more original artists for sure. You can put a period after that. But let's not act like she makes all the music and plays all the instruments. Her team is pretty damn good at making something from not much.\n\nVulnicura offers almost nothing new, but rekindles parts and pieces of the last couple albums, even going back to the Homogenic era for instrumentation. But you will still hear Vespertine-like pieces mixed in even with some of the Medulla sound that made that album so creatively diverse. It comes together fairly well on many of the songs. Others just sound like random relationship problems put to disc with quality strings, and do not excite me or enliven my spirit in the slightest.\n\nIt's treading water long since refolded into various other more interesting works. This is just not as essential as anything going backwards from Medulla to Homogenic. The strings and instrumentation are good even gorgeous at times. The catatonic beats and collage atmosphere combined with the siren-like background singing has been done before and with more cohesion.\n\nI like the lyrics in places. I also get tired of hearing \"I\" so much in these songs, even if it is a break-up album. I'm sorry Bjork but I'm not always interested in your personal life. I don't hate the album at all. But it's simply not memorable. This is an album that was put out to satisfy emotional demands coming directly from the artist. It's definitely something to hear once or twice, but beyond that I have no idea how to recommend it when there are 8 or so other better works by the same artist, a couple of which have many of the same characteristics.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"RCA's \"Fabulous Swing Collection\" was released to exploit a national big band revival craze, led by groups like Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Brian Setzer's Orchestra and in full swing (pardon the pun) in 1998. That revival has cooled but this generous (19 songs, 65 minutes) set remains among the era's better one-disc compilations (all songs from RCA family labels)  for now third-generation fans.\nIt may not have been all the classics revivalists danced to; two swingin' Louises (Prima and Jordan) recorded their jump, jive and wailin' big band tunes for Capitol and Decca Records, respectively. But many of the era's signature tunes are represented, sounding surprisingly warm in analog sound: Glenn Miller's anthemic \"In The Mood,\" \"String of Pearls,\" and \"American Patrol,\" Benny Goodman's hard, wild swinging \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" (heard recently and famously in a cookie commercial but better in Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert), Cab Calloway's 1933 \"Minnie The Moocher,\" which he performed nearly a half-century later in the first \"Blues Brothers\" film and here does in full-throated youthful yodel.\nYou also get seminal sides from Charlie Barnet (\"Cherokee\"), Tommy Dorsey (\"Marie,\" \"Opus One\"), and Duke Ellington (\"Take The 'A' Train,\" \"Cotton Tail\"). While these songs swing sweeter than 1998's martini-and-cigar crowd might have liked, \"Fabulous\" may well be among the few big band CDs a new fan would need. Longtime fans have these classics on the artists' original LPs (or more studious sets like Columbia's \"16 Most Requested Big Band Themes\") and can probably swing past it.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I like this album, even better than their last one, but neither evokes the experimental unique genre merging sounds of their first couple of albums.\n\nIn fact, this one sounds remarkably like the rest of these bands, Leave's Eyes, Lacuna Coil, head dunking metal intros, innocent school girl vocal bridges, goth metal redundancies throughout.\n\nPerhaps they need to massacre something else next time.  They are starting to sound as redundant and repetitive as their album covers and with the deep heard before thuds of guitar peppering many of the tunes, they are sounding very 90s (And not 1890s steampunkish, but real 1990s...)","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"ABiCA who have been on the music underground for a few years now, even releasing 3 albums along the way, but it is with this release \"Numb\" that is now taking the band out of the underground scene and into the mainstream! \"Numb\" which is also considered the bands first official release is a blend of many styles from rap, hip hop, rock and even dance. If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is gonna hit you hard as it's a giant leap in quality.\n\nHash and Tac who are the two mcs\/vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style, it helps that they both have distinct voices and don't sound like each other. The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track \"Numb\" before the vocals kick in, it's a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note, in reality it's just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles. \"Tell Us Why\" comes bouncing out with heavy beats and industrial sounding guitars as Tac and Hash are joined by Binary Audio who were two thirds of the British band Radiator, Janne Jarvis joins on vocals and the song has a real Nine Inch Nails style to it. \"Turn Me On\" has a great interplay of vocals and keeps the album flowing into \"My Song\" which features former memeber Cant on vocals, the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy. The track features a cool loop throughout the track.\n\n\"The things You Think I Say\" features Approaching Nirvana on vocals and he gives the song a Linkin Park laid back sound. \"The Pursuit\" sounds like vintage \"Licensed To Ill\" Beastie Boys. \"Take This Away\" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background, it's a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well. On \"I Can Be Real\" ABiCA get real heavy, with some big drums and heavy guitars, the song is produced by Tweaker Ray who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself, his production qualities really shine on the track.\n\nABiCA even give us a big dance sounding track on \"Gave Em A Reason\" a track that features a big chorus. Former member Cant appears again on \"Blurry\". The final track \"What You See\" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties, it's a great way to finish off the album. The only complaint you can really level at the album is that at 16 songs it might be too long, especially for a debut and considering the short attention span climate we now live in.\n\nWith \"Numb\" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album, which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012. It's amazing to think the Tac and Hash have produced and released their own album, the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release, the artwork is cool with detailed information on who produced and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was. ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals. ABiCA are determined to get their name out there, and even on Hash's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people. ABiCA \"Numb\" deserves to be heard by a wide audience!!","classification":4,"fold":2}

They are a great band and I remember when the song 1st came out, I loved it 1st time I heard it, and still love it. Its a great song to play when you are running low on energy and need to keep going. Yeah, the lyrics are kind of dirty, but they are just words. Based on the amount of music they sell, it's obvious that 90% of the people who say they don't buy their songs, actually do. Its a great song, with a great sound and I play it a lot. Kind of a challenge to learn words as song is so fast, but I did that years ago, so all set!

{"text":"Tornado kicks off with a paint-by-numbers, kick-back-and-party-hearty chugger, \"Pavement Ends.\"  Next up is a paint-by-numbers kick-back-and-party-wet \"Pontoon.\"  It isn't `til four tracks in, on \"Your Side of the Bed,\" that Little Big Town tackles anything of emotional substance (here, the creeping estrangement of a couple who apparently painted by the numbers a little too long).  Next, the fetching \"Leavin' in Your Eyes\" is outstanding, with its layered call-and-response harmonies evoking Fleetwood Mac more than a little.  But then it's back to coloring inside the lines.  Where are the rousers such as \"Runaway Train\" and \"Little White Church\" that made 2010's The Reason Why such an alarm clock to the country-rock competition?  Now that Gloriana's reduced to a trio, and Lady Antebellum has a lock on lots of mid-tempo murmurs, Little Big Town's four-part harmonies should be splashing accents all over the front porch.  Instead, Tornado is just a little dust devil that only jiggles the paint cans, leaving nearly every stone unturned.","classification":3,"fold":2}

As the music reflected the architecture, life did not reflect the music. Does slow represent one-third of a lifestyle? Ah, the enlightened among us say yes, even more than one-third. But the rest of us who are too busy to chase enlightenment, we need assistance from the world of classical music to slow it down a bit and grab a few minutes of peace and serenity from their compositions.\n\nSometimes in these blogs we discuss the music that has been unheard from the Bach Guild vaults, or tell stories of the recordings, but in this case, we have simply to say, the majority of what youll here is from the baroque recordings from the Bach Guild recordings. We've put all of the key artists from the label.\n\nWe've left some of the late classical and romantic adagios out so create a smoothness of transitions, and a consistency of mood. Our adagios are mostly upbeat and joyful, we've left some of the more melancholy and sad adagios out, but maybe they'll be put together in another selection soon.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Throughout his life Ray Charles overcame obstacles that would defeat lesser men. He was partially blinded in an unfortunate accident in his back yard at age 5 and became totally blinded at the age of 7. Rather than wallow in his misfortune, a very young Ray Charles began to study classical piano and clarinet at the State School for Deaf and Blind Children in St. Augustine, FL. Ray quickly figured out that music was what he wanted to do with his life. He moved to Seattle in 1948 at the age of 18 and formed the Maxin Trio. Just a year later the group signed a recording contract with a small Los Angeles based label called Swingtime. After just a few months the groups debut release \"Confession Blues\" rose all the way to #2 on Billboard's R & B chart. A couple of other hits followed and important people in the music business began to take notice. One of them was Ahmet Ertegan of Atlantic records who had a knack for discovering important new talent. Ray Charles would ink a deal with Atlantic records in 1952 and the rest as they say is history. Over the next five and a half decades Ray Charles would become an institution and one of the most important recording artists and \"live\" performers in American musical history.\n\nWhile Ray Charles was wildly popular among jazz and R & B afficianados during the 1950's he really hit his stride with general audiences after signing a deal with ABC-Paramount in 1960. There were certainly a lot of raised eyebrows when Ray opted to leave Atlantic but evidently he knew what he was doing. During his 14 year stay at ABC Ray Charles had around 60 charted singles and recorded dozens of successful albums in a wide variety of musical styles. Which brings us to his biggest hit single of all-time.\n\n\"I Can't Stop Loving You\" is a popular song written and composed by country singer, songwriter and musician Don Gibson, who first recorded it on December 30, 1957, for RCA Victor Records. It was released in 1958 as the B-side of \"Oh, Lonesome Me\", becoming a double-sided country hit single. Four years later in 1962 Ray Charles recorded his unforgettable version of this tune. It raced up the charts at breakneck speed and within just a few weeks was the #1 song in the land and remained at the top of the charts for 5 weeks. The song earned Charles a Grammy for \"Best R&B Record\" of 1962. This is Ray Charles at the absolute zenith of his long and incredibly successful career.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Some of the greatest rock and roll of all time came from the 1960's, and what makes the decade so extraordinary is how the bands sounded coming in at the first and leaving by 1970.  The Dave Clark Five started as the Dave Clark Quintet, the history going back to 1957, which is important as far as Beatles comparisons.  While historians rightfully put The Beatles at the top of the heap from this amazing decade, we would be remiss (and wrong) to assume there weren't other outfits who were no clones at all, and doing equally fabulous work of their own.  The U.S. had The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons - Britain of course gave us the fabled British Invasion, with tons of clones of the Beatles, but a few that were genuinely the real deal.  Most folks will probably agree that The Yardbirds and The Dave Clark Five were the top of the line competitors to the Fab Four, although The Yardbirds, who boasted Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as lead guitarists, were setting the stage for heavy music, especially after Jeff Beck split to form the Jeff Beck Group, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.\n  The DC5 were more pure rock and rollers, and they knew their stuff!  This album was available just in the last few weeks for about $25, so I'm surprised the price has jumped up again.  Dave Clark committed one of the biggest blunders in rock history when, after the band broke up in 1970, he saw fit not to release any material at all until after 2000, by which time LP's had worn out, there were probably very few cassettes, and they don't last either, and radio stations dropped them after their copies were too beat up to play.  This meant a generation would come and go before the public got to hear them again, and by that time only those who were teens in the '60's even knew who the DC5 even were.\n  A splendid PBS documentary did raise awareness, including mine, and although I had heard them before, I had not paid much attention.  I'm glad I did now, because they were great.  Tons of hits here include \"Glad All Over\", \"Any Way You Want It\", \"Sha Na Na Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\", which is much tougher than the more watered down version usually played on the radio, and other great songs that bristled with energy and great playing throughout.  It is interesting to speculate what may have happened had this amazing band continued and started forging new sounds.  They were already tough as nails, so they could have been big time hard rockers with more guitars.  Unfortunately we will never know.\n  But for those who love real genuine rock and roll at its best, and want to hear what other outfits from the Beatlemania years sounded like, you really owe it to yourself to check out the Dave Clark 5.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Not only is it the best song of the album, it's *maybe* the best song they've ever recorded. At least for me. I prefer the Deftones sound with less screaming and more melodies.

{"text":"\"Dry\" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.\n\nThe album starts with the simplistic \"Oh My Lover\", the track is simple yet effective and isn't an all-out assault on the ears. I really like the starkness in P.J.'s voice.\n\"O Stella\" seems a bit like a reprise of the previous track, though I do like this song better, it's shorter and does more musically, but that doesn't mean I hate \"Oh My Lover\".\n\nNext up is \"Dress\", I like the repitition in the lyrics and the double bass part which is played to perfection. The song has a very syncopated feel, even though at times an irregular feel.\n\"Victory\" is another great track with a nice echo section in it and some nice guitar parts. The bass is great, the drums are probably stronger than ever since the start of the album.\n\n\"Happy And Bleeding\" sounded like it had elements of country and folk in it upon first listen and I still can hear little elements of it, though not as much now, it's another great track though a bit of variation in the riffs would've be nice.\n\"Sheela-Na-Gig\" is one of the best songs on the album and the most successfull single off the album, the structure of the song is perfect, especially the 'I'm gonna wash that man right of my hair...' bit. I like the chorus, it's really catchy.\n\n\"Hair\" keeps the same formula that has made the album what it is and doesn't interrupt the flow at all. All the basic things are here, good lyrics, catchy hooks and superb instrumenation.\n\"Joe\" is another short track that is set at a very fast tempo, it seems to be gone and over really quick. It's still a nice track though.\n\n\"Plants And Rags\" is the best song on the album and seems a bit out of place on the album, I love the way the strings are used and written. This song is without a doubt the most emotional album on the album and P.J. proves her voice's potential well on this track.\n\n\"Fountain\" starts off incredibly lo-fi and then breaks into the signature sound of the album. I like the contrast and how it makes the song a bit segmented. \"Water\" has been described as the 'lightest' track off the album, although it does seem a bit light, it still has that punch about it. Great vocals by P.J. again.\n\nOverall, \"Dry\" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be \"Plants And Rags\" & \"Sheela-Na-Gig\", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a true musical genius.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Emeli Sande's \"Next To Me\" is good song for her first major hit.  She showcases powerful soulful vocals to her largest audience so far.  Despite the success of \"Next To Me\", there are some elements to be improved as she moves forward in her career.\n\nThe first is her singing.  She was a great voice and knows she can hit the loud notes quite well.  She manages to stay relatively under control with that in this song.  However, if she falls too in love with her ability to raise the volume, she could end up as a vocal train wreck like Christina Aguilera (an enormously talented voice completely undermined by her refusal to do anything other than 'shout sing').\n\nThe second is that Sande needs to sit down with her music team and get them to stop over-producing her music.  Throughout much of \"Next To Me\", there is a male backing vocal that keeps reciting \"hey... hey... hey...hey... hey...hey...hey\".  Beyond being distracting to Sande's singing, it also adds absolutely nothing to the overall quality of the song.  It's like a studio engineer was playing with sound effects buttons and decided to throw this in just because he could.\n\nKeeping these things in mind and addressing them, Emeli Sande has the potential for a long career.","classification":3,"fold":2}

Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop.  It's mostly folk with a rock edge.  Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences.  Really, \"Intuition\" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!","classification":1,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is an outstanding compilation of 15 Barry duets over the years with some other real famous grammy-award winning folks, and it is wonderful!  What a line-up!  A hair over one hour (almost 62 minutes) of beautiful music!  Also included is a 16-page booklet with photos of Barry with many of these folks as well as a little bit of verbiage about the album.  Just for an added special touch, the CD case is heavier and better quality than most you receive with a new CD.\n\nCD\n1.  You've Got A Friend (with Melissa Manchester) - 2011 release -- \"previously unreleased mix\" - If you say \"I have this already,\" - yes, so do I, but this has additional enhancement added in and is even better than the rendition from the former collection.\n2.  Hey Mambo (with Kid Creole and the Coconuts) - 1987 release - Nice peppy song from Barry's \"Swing Street\" CD - latin-swing.\n3.  Let Me Be Your Wings (with Debra Byrd) - 1994 release - from the Thumbelina Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.  This is a very beautiful song.\n4.  Cherish\/Windy (with The Association) - 2006 release - beautiful arrangement combining the two songs from Barry's \"The Greatest Songs of the Sixties\" CD.\n5.  Look to the Rainbow (with Barbara Cook) - 1991 release - from the 1947 musical Finian's Rainbow  and on Barry's \"Showstoppers\" CD - I absolutely LOVE this song.  It is so very beautiful.  (This is one of two Barry songs that makes me feel as if I've come \"home\" again.  I have no idea why.)\n6.  Islands in the Stream (with Reba McEntire) - 2008 release - a peppy \"fun\" song from Barry's \"The Greatest Songs of the Eighties\" CD.\n7.  Big City Blues (with Mel Torme' and featuring Gerry Mulligan) -- - 1984 release - from Barry's \"2:00 a.m. Paradise Caf'\" jazz CD.\n8.  On a Slow Boat to China (with Bette Midler) - 2003 release - a cute, peppy rendition of a classic song (with added comedic lyrics) from Bette's \"Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook\" CD.  This is a \"fun\" song.\n9.  Run to Me (with Dionne Warwick) - 1985 release - from the Warwick \"Finder of Lost Loves\" CD and from the Barry \"The Manilow Collection\/Twenty Classic Hits\".\n10. Summertime (with Diane Schuur and featuring Stan Getz) - 1987 release - This famous Gershwin tune from Porgy and Bess is just awesome.\n11. Sincerely\/Teach Me Tonight (with Phyllis McGuire) - 2006 release - from Barry's \"Greatest Songs of the Fifties\".  This is also a very pretty arrangement of two great songs.  Very smoothly done.\n12 .Blue (with Sarah Vaughan) - 1984 release - from Barry's \"2:00 a.m. Paradise Caf'\" jazz CD.\n13. Now and Forever (with Sheena Easton) - 1995 release - Such a gorgeous song from the DVD \"The Pebble and the Penguin\" (such a cute little movie about penguins that Barry did all the musical arranging for).  This may be a \"kid's\" movie, but I loved it too--and the music was superb!\n14. I Won't Be the One to Let Go (with Barbra Streisand) - 2002 release from the Barbra Streisand \"Duets\" CD.  A beautiful song!  Does it get any better than Manilow and Streisand together!\n15. The Last Duet (with Lily Tomlin) - 1980 release from the Barry \"Barry\" CD.  An interesting and lively song, which includes Lily's famous \"snort\".\n\nBooklet\nThe full-color 16-page booklet includes pictures of Barry with most of the other celebrities in the duets.  What is also so cool is that these are pix over the years, ranging from 1980 to 2008.  Pix include Barry with: Kid Creole, Debra Byrd, Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, Dionne Warwick, Diane Schuur, Phyllis McGuire, Barbra Streisand, Lily Tomlin, and Mel Torme' (in a NY Yankees Baseball cap).\n\nThis is just one awesome collection and a real nice bang for the buck! BTW, many of the duets are not easily found on other Barry albums. One song may be on only one album.\n\nUpdate 5\/21\/11 - There are some gorgeous duets on this album but #1 to me is \"Now and Forever\".  It's a wonderful song, and Barry and Sheena sound GREAT together.  It's a wonder I haven't worn out the track yet, but I'm trying. . .","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I admit I was among those that were struck as if by a lighting when I saw the video for \"Intuition\" a while back: \"She sold out!\" thoughts crossed my mind... \"I'm so dissapointed!\" I thought, until a friend told me I had to really listen to the album, so I just did.\nThough I am not terribly in love with the whole album (it's sure more pop than most of her past efforts, and it has no shortage of 'catchy' tunes), the nonconventional lyrics are still there, at times, hiding disguised behind songs with teenage-like names, such as \"2 Find U\". The truth is that after the fact, the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with \"Intuition\", the song\/video that has stigmatized her so much.\nBut yes! As a whole, it's not tough to see that most of the songs are geared toward a more teenage audience, rather than the one that grew through College listening to her earlier work, but there's a few songs for those of us that are in the latter category, such as the very Alanis-like \"Haunted\" (in fact, it's such an appropriate song to play out loud on a Halloween night like tonight) and the clever \"America\". Falling somewhere in between the preferences of the two groups lies the closing track, \"Becoming\" which I particularly loved.\nAll in all, this is an album mostly geared to a teenage audience with a little \"classic\" Jewel to offer for her longtime followers.","classification":3,"fold":2}

I was 10 years old when my uncle put their first album on,i have been into them since then. They put out another real good album but then i thought they got a little too radio. But this says F**k that ! This reminds me of the oldschool Buckcherry with insane energy. Sick little licks in their while they never let down on some killer grooves. These songs are all genuine and have that classic Buckcherry groove. Solid Ep and i am glad i came across it. It's good to have an old friend come on back through to jam with you. If you know what i'm saying you will enjoy this album.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"\"Best of Friends\" is okay.  Especially noteworthy is the guitar solo in the middle of the song; it's great!  The song has good energy, but the band is over-singing, and they are out of tune in several places.  The recording quality is odd; it sounds a bit like it was recorded in a hollow tunnel by a band that included screaming out the lyrics  (look at the cover!) and pounding on the drums.  Note: this is a new band, working out their sound.  Overall, it's okay, but I'd like to hear them in a couple of years when they've had a chance to grow.  I'm glad I got it on a free promotion.  I wouldn't pass by the station if this was playing on the radio, but I wouldn't want to pay to hear it, either.","classification":3,"fold":2}

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

{"text":"there are a lot of fans who have been begging dave for a release from the 80's....well here it is,  a really excellent show . right from the opening notes of ' feel like a stranger' there is a lush, and warm sound that i can only attribute to brent's keyboards, very nice.  the connection jerry has with his new keyboard player is a joy to listen to. the whole band seems fired up and into tonights performance ! 'loser' is slow and smoldering, with a guitar run in the middle that will peel the paint right off the walls. 'cassidy' changes the tempo nicely;; remembering an old friend. 'ramble on rose' is slowed down tonight an interesting and different version. i like it ! bobby pulls out all his blues tricks next on 'little red rooster' a great version featuring great slide guitar, hot, hot ! 'bird song' is played beautifully, and jerry's singing is sweet as a spring day! ' me and my uncle' then 'big river' are first set favorites then finish disc 1 with a gentle ' it must have been the roses' very nice. disc 1 gets 5 stars. disc 2 opens with 'lost sailor\/ st. of circumstance' which is one of my favorite 80's dead tunes;; such a difficult song to pull off well and it's played great here tonight. 'deal' hits the gas pedal and the band is flying now, they are all feeling it as jerry shifts the band into overdrive ! 'scarlet beg.\/ fire on the mountain' is the center piece of disc 2 and this version lives up to all the hype i've heard about how good it is. a great version. 20 + min. of a smokin' mid-show jam. again, brent's keyboards shine as does the whole band sounding hot. a really fine performance. 'samson and delilah' is a rockin' version and brent and jerry are really enjoying each other. as usual billy and mickey are hammering away on the drums as well. the crowd gets to catch their breath with 'ship of fools' closing out disc 2.disc 2 gets 5 stars. nicely played. disc 3 starts with 'playing in the band' and brent's keyboards jump right out and sounds different from the versions we hear back in the 70's. the song unfolds nicely and the jam features excellent guitar playing that makes this song one of my favorite second set numbers. a really excellent version here !! 15+ min. that melts into drums\/space. a fairly long sequence that you will enjoy if your into it. a little long for my taste but very popular with some fans. the space part is really nice and evolves into a lovely jam that i like a lot,, certainly one of my favorites.' the wheel' grows out of space beautifully , a really special transition. then a soft and gentle 'china doll' which is a very mellow moment. everyone comes back to life with \"around and around' and 'johnny b. goode' and the show closes with ' uncle johns band'. you guessed it disc 3 gets 5 stars. 3 hours of really fine grateful dead. hope you get your copy quick !","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow\" says Ed Sheeran on \"Take It Back\", a lively acoustic rapped\/sung number from his sophomore disc titled \"X\" for multiply, and what a flow he has. Fans of his debut \"+\" (\"Plus\" - notice a pattern here?) will find more to like here, an edgier more mature Sheeran. There is a fuller sound this time around enveloping his clever picturesque lyrics and folky base.\n\nOpening cut \"One\" is a folky ballad with his impassioned vocals alternating between lower register and falsetto. Lead-off single \"Sing\" is co-written and produced by Pharrell, driven by hard beats and flamenco-style guitars, lovely harmonies and a killer singalong \"Oh o o o\" hook with shades of Justin Timberlake. It works very well and became his first UK chart topper. \"Don't\" is a handclap-driven number, a tale about a cheating lover. \"Nina\" has more of an urban feel with nice tinkling piano and a spoken\/sung delivery.\n\n\"Bloodstream\" sets cyclic-sounding guitars to a gently thumping beat. The perky \"Runaway\" is another Pharrell production. The catchy groovy \"The Man\" is reminiscent of fellow Brit The Streets, and finds him rapping \"Sorry for the honesty, but I had to get this off my chest\". The soulful \"Thinking Out Loud\" sounds like Marvin Gaye gone acoustic, with hints of \"Let's Get It On\". \"Afire Love\" showcases his vocals against an enchanting piano\/violin backdrop, a touching look at his Grandfather's battle with alzheimer's.\n\nThe deluxe edition has 4 additional songs, including the earlier mentioned \"Take It Back\" and his enthralling \"I See Fire\" from \"The Hobbit\" soundtrack, subtle and anthemic all at once.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Why does Joell Ortiz have to make it so hard for us to wait for a new Slaughterhouse album? Putting out nice albums like his latest, That's Hip Hop, makes it even harder. You can tell how great he would sound in the group again because his rhyme game is so tight here, and after all, he's obviously been working on it continuously. The Brooklyn backpack bomber comes off of 2014's House Slippers and 2015's Human with Illmind for this very retro, throwback-themed project, and it's got a lot of hardcore rap cats on it just doing their thing, with production that is true-to-the-pit boom bap. That's Hip Hop was released Tuesday, March 15 on the record label of the same name.\n\nThe album was clearly designed with the pure rap\/rhyme addicts in mind. Like a typical Joell Ortiz set, it is not loaded with messages and really only aims towards a social end when Jo describes his urban N.Y.C. milieu and community across a handful of songs, when he tells a woman's sob story for her in \"Precious\" and when he tells some of his own war stories of hard times in \"Trouble.\" Everything else is pretty much a lyrics-fest. Experienced, respected guys like Kool G Rap, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. start that good golden-era fire, and some neo-shine is cast by new jewels like Raven Felix, Chris Rivers and Token, the last of whom has a very double-edged verse in \"Kill at Will\" - it's very fast, very nimble and very impressive delivery-wise, but as insane rap mouthpieces tend to do, the search for meaning and message gets lost in his ravishing rapacious technique.\n\nJoell's well tuned machine-mouth works just fine here, but those offensive, shockingly controversial bits and pieces that all hip-hop heads know, love and look for are few in That's Hip Hop. Without making striking statements that are anti-status quo or anti-establishment, like he should, he depends on his striking yet easy obscenities and profanities to turn heads. And it was just like this on his last two albums as well. Many of us look to talented and skilled emcees like Joell to spread awareness about the world's problems, but sadly there's too little of that in the correct form here. Technically, Joell Ortiz is a beast and so are his features, and the producers have properly and impressively fashioned their beats into that vintage '90s style of hip-hop production, but if you're looking for new enlightening messages, you may not want to spend a lot of time on this disc.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Manowar is looked upon as godly(the fans are hardcore, more than just about any group you can think of)or thought of as heavy metal's biggest joke.  This was my first taste of Manowar back in the day, and I was a little confused about it at first.  I wasn't sure if they were trying to be funny or not.  Well, since I got more into them over the years I know that these guys are dead serious about what they're doing.  They're music and image is extremely cornball, I would hope even the most hardcore fan could admit to seeing a bit of humor in it all.  But to me, that's all a part of what makes Manowar Manowar.  These guys are the epitome of male ma-cheese-mo;  I mean, they're the total embodiment of tough guy-Conan-badass-motorcycle riding-sexist-violent maleness taken to it's most extreme.  It makes you want to strip down to your undies and run about the house wielding an invisible sword while munching on a giant turkey leg.  And that's just the way they portray themselves.  But, for all of this braggadocio these guys really do know how to play, they're not all about image.  Eric Adams has one helluva voice though it sounds like he's straining too hard on the high notes.  When you listen to his raspy high pitched scream, you can just envision him with a blue face, veins bulging, on the verge of his head exploding.  That's a singer.  So, say what you want about them, but there's only one Manowar.  If you're curious, it wouldn't hurt to give this album a spin.  I would think most heavy metal fans will get something out of Manowar, even if it is only a good laugh.  I think you'd have to be a real stiff to wholeheartedly say that you \"hate\" them, but there are certainly many out there who do.  However, there isn't one group in existence that isn't hated by someone somewhere.  So, give these guys a shot;  For better or worse, you'll always remember them.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Grizzly Bear have made a reputation for themselves as being a precise, meticulous and at times very uptight and stuffy rock band. I use the term 'rock band' very loosely as well. Go back and listen to Yellow House and Veckatimest and tell me with a straight face that those two albums are rock albums. Do it.  I dare you. Listen, I'm not putting down Grizzly Bear because the fact of the matter is that I love Grizzly Bear. They create mood, emotion(in a truncated way) and an atmosphere of grandiosity within their chamber pop songs. It's like the Brodsky Quartet scoring an Ingmar Bergman film. It's just that in the past the guys in Grizzly Bear, while making very emotional and powerful music, had a tendency to keep the listener at arms length. You felt that there was something more they wanted to say, but out of embarrassment or fear of sharing too much and scaring us away they cut their message short and clammed up just when they were getting to the point.\n\nWell, the overly shy and introverted Grizzly Bear is no more. With Shields, Grizzly Bear's fourth full-length, they have made their most open, loose and absolute best album to date.\n\n'Sleeping Ute' opens the album with a  wild, drunken sway. Folksy and musty, this song gives off the feel of history. It has the smell of old leather and the cold sea air. This song grooves and breathes like no other Grizzly Bear song up to this point. It reminds me of CSNY's 'Wooden Ships' but leaner and more direct. It's a song that looks at you eye-to-eye, never looking off to the side. 'A Simple Answer' is another track that you would've never heard on a Grizzly Bear album up to this point. A driving tom-filled beat, with Rossen singing \"Those saints in Lockstead\/Across the wasteland\/Forever gone\/They're home and walk along\", you get a bit of story telling in this very pop-inflected song. It's such a carefree song that you almost forget who you're listening to.\n\nRossen isn't the only one to undo the top button on his neatly pressed shirt and loosen his tie. Ed Droste sings us some great songs within this great album. 'Gun-Shy' is a breezy, head swaying pop song. It feels as if Droste has decided to not be so serious and enjoy the fact that he actually has a 'band' now. He needn't compose with the idea that these songs are being written for just his ears. He's taking full advantage of the fact that he's got an amazing band to fill out his quiet pop songs. 'Yet Again' has the emotional heft we've grown to love about a Grizzly Bear song, except with more of a heart-on-his-sleeve honesty in Droste's voice. Droste sounds like he's pulling these songs from his heart, not his head.\n\nOpening the windows and letting some fresh air and perspective within the Grizzly Bear band dynamic has opened them up to new possibilities. No longer do they sound meticulous and carefully planned. They sound relaxed and loose. They don't sound like an art rock project or an indie rock string quartet. They sound like a band that loves what they do. And we're the better for it.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Im going to start off by saying that I was underwhelmed by Part I.  It lacked a visceral quality; it was very symphonic but it lacked punch and exciting flourish.  Part II is more of the same, but it is better (I think).  While still very symphonic it also puts more emphasis into its punch, its bite.  The guitar work is more present (or at least more obvious to my ears) and a lot more driving than in Part I.  But I discovered a curious thing while listening through the album several times.  When I listened to the album as a whole I thought it was okay to good but still not really great.  Maybe there still wasn't enough distinctiveness between the songs for me to hang my standout moments or tracks on, or maybe the songs blurred together too much.  Whatever it was I still came away from the experiences not feeling fulfilled or whatever I was looking to feel by this release.  But when I listened to the release song by song, focusing on each song individually instead of part of the whole, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this album a whole lot more.  Godmakers Temptation is a classic VP sound, an engaging track, and part of the first half of this release.  The following song Stone Roses Edge breaks into a gallop early on with some delicious guitars and nice keys surrounding them and filling them out, a heavy beat upping the intensity.  The first half of this release is pretty solid in fact.  Where I found myself losing interest or felt that the songs lost either energy or had an unfortunate blending was toward the end of the release.  And I think thats why this was so hard for me to really get into, because the first track (vision eleven as part of the Chronicles story) didn't immediately grab but the following three or four tacks did and then there were about three where the car slowed down before ending pretty well.  Symphonic metal fans, metal fans who like large religiously-tinged fantasy stories, and I suppose VD fans all will be satiated by Netherworld Part II.  For me, I will hope that they strip their sound down at points, and separate their flourishes on their next outing.  3.75 stars.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Never in the history of our world has there been a time for greater concern and action needed over energy, environmental, and social issues, that lie before us at present.  Our most recent 40th anniversary Earth Day held on April 22, 2009 had an estimated 1 billion participants worldwide, an astounding number when compared to the 20,000 million people first participating in 1969. The annual event is held each year to demonstrate what each of us as individuals can accomplish together in unity, while still retaining the core existence by relying solely on the power of one.\n\nCadence Spalding is one person doing their part as role model for bringing about a greater awareness of these concerns by her Save The World 2009 album release on the Sound Manipulations and JSA music label. The 11 tracks pertain to the noblest of desires in conveying her message of what one person alone can accomplish by caring for mother earth, caring for those who cannot help themselves, and by caring for one another as a family unit.\n\nCelebrity New Age musician Mars Lasar is also doing his part by co producing this themed album. His technological production talents and artistic skill in layering and mixing hold the key elements that enable Cadence to excel in the music she has primarily written and presented by her own hand. While having previously performed on Mars' albums, this first solo release certifies her individual talents worthy indeed, bearing fruit for this winning team who also happen to be husband and wife.\n\nSave The World is classical New Age pop, hosting a pleasant mix of ballads finely tuned to perfection in the purest sense. Classical touches of soft angelic vocals appears as lullabies at times, gently rocking you into a contented state, while anthem stanzas increase in momentum, rising above to greet the occasion. The harmonious choral effects arranged by layering passionate vocals offers her message of love, peace, and harmony to all who share the same logic, devotion, and mindful perspective.\n\nTrust In Love is one musical anthem sent as a deep heartfelt narrative of the glorious possibilities for peace and love that await every boy and girl, if only we would just let it be a reality. This soulful song is rich in vocal tone combined with personal statement through meaningful lyrics. The piano phrased beat is surrounded by a deep percussion rhythm like persons marching lock step in tandem, proposing that we trust in love and give peace a chance.\n\nSave The World title song offers an upbeat instrumental expression of the bountiful rewards we receive when we let our conscience be our guide and do our part.  This repeated message if framed by a pounding drum beat, while piano and guitar instrumentals ring out a clear tone during moments of pause between vocals.\n\nThis CD album also includes a bonus DVD which is really a treasure in itself. This professionally captured, artistic photo gallery DVD produced by Mars, is extraordinary in visual effect while highlighting the serene music of Candace. The magnificent colorful photos are dedicated to vivid landscapes, wildlife subjects, and touching scenes capturing people in everyday life.  This CD \/ DVD collector's edition is a beautiful performance and powerful statement, shared with the world after this initial spark of talented inspiration was ignited solely from the power of one.","classification":5,"fold":2}

I admired these on Lp and the sound quality -- although variable from performance to performance -- basically has held up well. For $0.99, this collection is a steal, but don't expect the virtuosity of more modern string quartets like the Alban Berg or Hagen or Emerson. As compensation, the playing is consistently warm-hearted. Think Bruno Walter's late recordings on Sony or Josef Krips and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra for similar approaches to Mozart's symphonic works.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song \"You Remind Me\".  Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/What-s-the-411\/dp\/B000002OME\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What's the 411?<\/a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples.  Obviously, the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan, I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more.  My favorite tracks ended up being \"Love No Limit\", \"Reminisce\", \"I Don't Want To Do Anything\" w\/K-Ci, \"My Love\", \"Real Love\" and Mary's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic \"Sweet Thing\".  In 1994, Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Life\/dp\/B000002OU8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Life<\/a>.  This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time.  Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD, but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times, the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD.  My favorite track was \"I Never Wanna Live Without You\" but I could play the CD in its entirety.  My other personal favorites include \"Mary's Joint\", \"I'm The Only Woman\", \"Be Happy\", \"Mary Jane\" and \"Be With You\".  The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well.  I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on \"I Love You\", LL Cool J on \"Mary Jane\", and the late Notorious BIG (Biggie) ripping the \"I'm Goin' Down\" (Remix)) which used the beat for the track \"The What\" that was featured on Biggie's \"Ready To Die\" that also included Method Man.  Mary J had plenty of other releases:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Share-My-World\/dp\/B000002P64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Share My World<\/a>&nbsp;(1997)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mary\/dp\/B00000JWQH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mary<\/a>&nbsp;(1999)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/No-More-Drama\/dp\/B00005V9DW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">No More Drama<\/a>&nbsp;(2002)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Life\/dp\/B0000AQS8W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;(2003)\n\nFrom these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as \"Seven Days\", \"All That I Can Say\", \"The Love I Never Had\", \"Special Part Of Me\", \"Ooh!\", \"Everything\" and \"Share My World\".  Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>.  She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single \"Be Without You\".  \"Darkchild\" blessed her with my favorite track, \"Enough Cryin'\" and my other favorites included \"I Found My Everything\", \"Take Me As I Am\", \"No One Will Do\" and \"Father In You\".  Mary's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Reflections-A-Retrospective\/dp\/B000JU8HHE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Reflections - A Retrospective<\/a>.  The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single \"We Ride\", the title track and \"King & Queen\" w\/John Legend.  Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks, with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man's \"All I Need\", that was featured on \"Tical\" and \"911\" w\/Wyclef Jean.\n\n\"Growing Pains\" was released on December 18th, 2007.  The CD starts off with the uptempo \"Work That\".  Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people.  Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have.  Ludacris appears on \"Grown Woman\" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track \"Runaway Love\" that was featured on Ludacris' last release \"Release Therapy\".  In my opinion, \"Grown Woman\" is basically a continuation of \"Work That\".  You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman, mentally and physically.  Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies, young and old around the world.  Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track, with a touch of attitude.  \"Just Fine\" is basically Growing Pains' \"Family Affair\".  It doesn't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week, it's Friday night and this beat comes on, go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do.  \"Just Fine\" is a nice, uptempo feel good jam.  \"Feel Like A Woman\"  has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman.  Whether it's a shopping trip, making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture, tonight she just wants to feel like a woman.  The slow jam man, Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce \"Stay Down\", which is a thoughtful slow jam.  In every relationship, you are going to have ups and downs.  No relationship is perfect.  The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end.  \"Hurt Again\" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past.  \"Shake Down\" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track, you have huge expectations.  Just like when you saw Usher and Alicia Keys on the track \"My Boo\", you expect the artists to make the collaboration memorable.  On \"Shake Down\", it's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track.  Pharrell does his best to try to take you back to the 80s on \"Til The Morning\", but for the most part, unless you want to grab some old fashioned roller skates and go to the skating rink, this song won't work for most Mary J. Blige fans.  On \"Roses\", Mary has to get a point across to her man that she is fed up with all of the confrontations with her man and today she is not having it for any reason.  I can definitely relate to this track.  Men:  You're in a no win situation when this day comes so let her vent and this type of day will go by faster and be much easier for you to handle...lol\n\nClearly, my favorite track on \"Growing Pains\" is \"Fade Away\".  Stargate, who has produced multilple Ne-Yo songs, Joe's \"It's Me\", Chris Brown's \"With You\", Rihanna & Ne-Yo's \"Hate That I Love You\", Trey Songz' \"Can't Help But Wait\" and most importantly to some people, Beyonce's \"Irreplaceable\", produce this memorable Mary J. track in \"Fade Away\".  Ne-Yo co-produces and writes the track as well.  Mary finds herself at times, because of all of her troubles not even wanting to be here on Earth.  That's how bad times have gotten for her in the past.  Although, her life is definitely much better than those times, she may still have moments where she feels like she did before irregardless of her success because of her past transgressions.  Ne-Yo does an excellent job of reaching back so to speak in times in Mary's past to capture these moments.  Here's the bridge: \"Couldn't look myself in the mirror, asking myself how dumb could you be.\"  \"Maybe everything would be much clearer, if no one could see me\".  Mary's times in the past were so bad she didn't even want to me amongst the living at times.  There were times when she just want to take herself out of this world and not even be here anymore.  That's where I feel the \"....invinsibility would be great\" part comes from on the track.  \"What Love Is\" is another memorable Mary, Stargate and Ne-Yo collaboration as Mary writes her rendition of what she feels the four letter word means just like Alicia Keys did on \"The Thing About Love\" from her \"As I Am\" CD.  The effects at the end of the track add to the track as well.  \"Work In Progress\" (Growing Pains) is also written by Ne-Yo as Mary walks you through how she is getting through life day by day the best she can.  She is clearly trying her best, but she also wants to let women in the world know that she is just as human as they are despite her success.  \"Talk To Me\" deals with Mary wanting to receive better communication from her man and the benefits of effective communication in a relationship.  \"If You Love Me\" is a decent track but it sounds too much like \"Be Without You\" Part 2 to me.  \"Smoke\" is clearly unlike any Mary J. Blige track that I have ever heard.  This track seems to be a part of Mary J.'s musical maturity. You never would have heard Mary on a track like this in the What's The 411 and My Life days.  As a matter of fact, she would have had a profanity laced tirade ready for Puffy if he even tried to bring her a track like this.  In the end, it clearly works for me and it's nice to see Mary trying different things.  \"Come To Me (Peace)\" ends \"Growing Pains\" on a good note as she is trying to win over the affection of a lost love from the past.\n\nOverall, \"Growing Pains\" may not be Mary J. Blige's best CD, but if you look at her career since 1992's \"What's The 411\" to now, you see alot of progression in her music and lyrics in 2007.  Not only do you see a growth process with Mary as a 37 year old woman but you also hear the growth process through her lyrics and her production.  If you are a fan of the majority of Mary J's releases, then you should also add \"Growing Pains\" to your collection.\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Fade Away\n2) What Love Is\n3) Stay Down\n4) Smoke\n5) Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nHurt Again\nRoses\nCome To Me (Peace)\nWork That\nJust Fine","classification":4,"fold":2}

I could not stop listening to this record!\nThis is a monumental concept album that tells the story of the rise of R&B's first superhero squad, The Gentleman, a trio of garbage men who are granted all that they have ever wanted-special powers, money, fame, women-after encoutering a mysterious figure. Inspired by Michael Jackson's cinematic videos of the 80s and early 90s, He dreamed of creating a 45-minute mini movie to be packaged within this album. He decided to release a series of extended music videos, which will run from 7-10 minutes. It's ambitious, he acknowledges, but well worth the creative and financial investment. Elaborate concepts and visual aside, at its core Libra Scale is vintage Ne-Yo: sophisticated songwriting, beautiful melodies and a voice that's as supple as it is powerful. This album should be go Platinum!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"What struck me first after hearing Mezzanine was its sheer weight. The sound, with its low beats and (in a first for Massive Attack) thrashing guitars, succeeds in actually oppressing the listener....and that's very  much a good thing, because the music in this album is just so very novel  and smooth you want to feel every part of it.\nAs usual with Massive  releases, \"Mezzanine\" features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  \"Teardrop\" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky \"Dissolved Girl,\"  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica.\nHorace  Andy, the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack's albums, has  three songs here, the industrial \"Angel,\" and the almost-retro  Massive Attack \"Man Next Door\" and \"(Exchange)\".\nThe  songs featuring the vocals of Massive's members 3D and Daddy G are also  well-done, and 3D's threatening whispers on \"Risingson\" do a lot  to make it one of my favourite songs.\nAlthough certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Matisyahu must have known his number was just about up. \"Spark Seeker\" finds him ditching the eclecticism of \"Light\" and \"Youth\" for a more electronic, hip hop (read, mainstream) sound. There's a lot of Auto-tuning and phase-shifted vocals and some guest appearances (rapper Shyne being the biggest name). In the biggest concession of all, gone are the huge beard and Hasidim garb. Heck, he's on a motorcycle on the album's inner-photo.\n\nWhat this means for the music is actually very little. Middle Eastern influences are melded into the hip-hop and rap; right from the beginning with one J.Ralph, he kicks off what sounds like a call to prayer (\"Crossroads\"). Hebrew choruses and verses mix in with the ultra slick beats, courtesy of producer Kool Kojak. Kojak's credits are mainly along the lines of Ke$sha, Nicki Manaj, Katy Perry and many others, so you know this was a crafted sonic move. But Matisyahu can't help it. He remains as eclectic as ever with a greater - if that is possible - sense of being an uplifting force in his music.\n\nThere's a smooth sax solo in \"Summer Wind,\" and a powerful lyric in \"Fire Of Freedom\" and slinky groove of \"Tel Avivin'.\" Which is not a false way to groove as the man recorded \"Spark Seeker\" both in Los Angeles and Israel. Matisyahu took his own journey to make this album in the personal and mystical sense, with the end result being his tightest and possibly his most provacative disc to date.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I was listening to the CDS for both \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help!\" when I suddenly realized that once again the Beatles were probably innovators ahead of their time. \"Help,\" as with the album from the first Beatles' movie, has songs from the film only on \"Side 1.\" Today we take for granted that soundtrack albums are filled with songs that never appear in movies or are at best \"inspired\" by a film. Well, the Beatles were doing that way back in 1965. Here is a \"soundtrack\" where one of the leftovers only happens to be the most recorded song in the history of human existence (it would be #13 on the play list for those of you who need a look before you go \"duh\").\n\"Help!\" is the final album of what in retrospect are the early Beatles. Next comes the short middle period of \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\" before the \"Sgt. Pepper\" period. Lennon & McCartney have 10 solid songs on this collection; their least impressive songs, \"Another Girl\" and \"Tell Me What You See,\" are still as good as anything else any other group was doing in the mid-Sixties. The title song and \"Ticket to Ride\" are biggies and \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" and \"I've Just Seen a Face\" are just a step below. The album earns only four stars because George gets two tracks on this album are they are both lesser examples of his work (he does much better next time out). Then add (subtract) the fact that is the last Beatles album in which the group covers songs written by others and neither \"Act Naturally\" nor \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\" was worth the effort. Even with those caveats this is not a Beatles album you would exclude from your music library. Actually, no such animal exists; even the \"Yellow Submarine\" soundtrack has a couple of solid songs beyond what we have already heard elsewhere.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Both ex THE 5th DIMENSION - Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr. had already clocked up 6 Grammy wins by the time they trumped 1st prize again at the 1977 Awards for Best R&B Vocal performance on \"You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show)\". And along comes this excellent CD reissue to remind us...\n\nUK released July 2014 - Big Break Records CDBBR 0276 (Barcode 5013929057630) gives us the \"I Hope We Get To Love On Time\" album across tracks 1 to 10 - first released on vinyl LP in August 1976 in the USA on ABC Records ABCD-952 (42:42 minutes). Tracks 11 and 12 are Bonuses - an outtake called \"I'm So Glad I Found You\" and the 7\" Single Version of \"You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show)\".\n\nThe 16-page booklet is the usual classy job from BBR with photos of the duo live and on TV, rare 7\" single picture sleeves and liner notes by NYC-based Music journalist Christian John Wikane that includes new interviews with the singers. Big Break's resident tape wizard WAYNE A. DICKSON has handled the remaster and it sounds fantastic - full of detail and bounce.\n\nThis is mid Seventies Soft Soul - very Stylistics with a little Disco thrown in - with the ballads like \"Nothing Can Stop Me\" allowing their voices to shine and the melody rise above the heavy string-arrangements. \"Easy Way Out\" is a lovely smoocher while the outtake \"I'm So Glad I Found You\" is a mid-tempo stepper. It's easy to see why the poppy Soul of \"Your Love\" was released as a single (ABC Records AB-12262).\n\nA quality reissue by BBR and a must own for fans.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Alright, Daughtry is definitely not as good as I thought he was. In fact, he might be the most unoriginal guy in modern rock to come around in quite awhile, and that's saying something. However, this time he doesn't sound like another artist, he sounds like his bad self, or more specifically, \"Over You\" which was his previous single. Anybody else see something wrong with this picture? And yet, he rules rock radio.\n\nThe verses are mediocre at best, and the chorus on its short run on radio is already annoying the heck out of me. It just doesn't seem real, like it's a half-hearted effort or something; something to please the record labels. Chris's vocals are stellar as always, but contrary to popular belief, the song itself makes for most of its success, and this one is made, but it's in pieces taped together in a quick effort to please a record executive.\n\nSo overall, on if, if not Daughtry's worse in a rather short career so far. Hopefully he'll come out his sophomore album rather soon, so the rest of the musical skeletons in his compact disc closet will stay where they belong: hidden.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"The Fox is one of Elton's least known outputs in his entire catalouge.  It justed missed the top 20 (in the US) upon its release in May, 1981.  It also marked a transitional period in his career, coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero.  Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33, due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places, it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years.\n\nI find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like \"Fascist Faces\", the beautiful instrumental trio \"Carla\/Etude\/Fanfare\" and the more traditional love ballad \"Chloe.\"  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make \"the cutting edge\" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.\n\nHighlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While \"Just Like Belgium\" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and \"Heels of the Wind\" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks \"Heart in the Right Place\" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and \"Fascist Faces\" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.\n\nIn the end, The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road, but it is one of the most interesting in Elton's now 35 + year solo career.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become \"I'm Still Standing\" and \"Sad Songs\" just a few years down the road.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Bloc Party's recent release, FOUR, is aptly named: it's been four years since their last album, the band's personnel consists of four core members, and after all, this is their fourth studio album.  It comes after a two-year self-imposed hiatus that found members of Bloc Party dabbling in other projects briefly (notably, lead singer Kele Okereke's electronic-dance record THE BOXER).  After the band's 3rd album INTIMACY, the break seems to have rejuvenated the band's music and energy.  With help from producer Alex Newport (who has helped with At the Drive-In\/The Mars Volta, and City and Colour), FOUR has an energy and immediacy that hasn't been heard in Bloc Party since their debut.\n\nWhere more indie-rock groups have decidedly gone more electronic in recent times, Bloc Party's FOUR is raw in comparison.  Even with the beginning of the album, the band has taken an approach that is messy and streamlined: \"So He Begins to Lie\" gives a false start before launching into the song proper.  The track leads into \"3x3,\" a song that picks up the pace even further.  The album-promoting single \"Octopus\" serves as a highlight of the album, and it's a good representative sample for the rest of the album (guitar-centric, with the vocalist pleading with his trademark vocals).  FOUR's first downtempo song, \"Real Talk\" is a great detour that veers in some unexpected places.  The Philip K. Dick-inspired \"V.A.L.I.S.\" is a decent enough song, but it's head-bobbing, hand-clapping beat is infectious.  The lyrics here aren't nearly as revealing or heartbreaking as they were on previous albums (particularly A WEEKEND IN THE CITY), with much of the content here focusing on anarchy and paranoia.  The album seems to lose its way towards the end -- the riffs aren't as hard, the vocals not as urgent, the ballads not as heartbreaking -- but it's alright: FOUR is a fun ride worth taking.\n\nFans of Bloc Party's SILENT ALARM will really dig this record.  I would recommend this to fans of Artic Monkeys, Metric, and Two-Door Cinema Club.  The harder edge that the band brings to this album may put off some of the band's more recent fans, but it will be sure to surprise others.

{"text":"Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century. That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.\n\nThis compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like \"Monday, Monday\", \"Let's Hang On\", and \"Yellow Submarine\". (Yes, it's true that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece \"Queen of the House.\" I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.\n\nListening to this CD is delightfully awful, and I recommend the experience highly to any audiophile who thinks they have heard it all.\n\nRock on, Mrs. Miller!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"When it has came down to cover songs, nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with. For Kelly Sweet, who did a brilliant rendition of Aerosmith's Dream On a few years ago that worked well, it definitely has been a surprise, but for continuing that with others it just doesn't work as well. It works poorly like Mariah Carey trying to do another rendition of a Def Leppard song as if they were trash. Kelly's cover of Phil Collins' massive staple In The Air Tonight doesn't feel like it actually has the stamina. In fact, the cover feels whitewashed and made cheaper in voice and absolute harmony of the soul. I really was not impressed with the song, and for Kelly, trying to be something she is not is just very poor. The song choice and song matter, but for Kelly, she should do better to keep something in the air tonight.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":2}

She spent the past several years focusing on her work in Las Vegas, and many have wondered if Celine would ever make a new song again. With her new song Loved Me Back To Life, her first new song in 5 years, sounds absolutely strong, like her early songs that had made her a major success in the rankings of other divas. The song stands up well with her classics like It's All Coming Back To Me Now, and Where Does My Heart Beat Now. The song definitely is a much better song than what radio has really put out lately with cheap artists from Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. Hopefully, fans will definitely welcome this back from Celine Dion. I like the song, and I am very eager to see if she'll make something that strong.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Even if you don't care for dance beats and rap peppered with expletives, it's hard not to get hooked by the craftiness with which Girl Talk (Gregg Gillis) mashes up hundreds of soft pop, classic rock, hip-hop and rap samples. Simply playing \"what's that sample\" will provide hours of fun as you untangle iconic riffage from the Spencer Davis Group, Twisted Sister, Argent, Eddie Floyd, Heart, Rick Derringer, The Carpenters, Metallica, Elvis Costello, Carole King, Prince, The Velvet Underground, Chicago, ? and the Mysterians,  and hundreds more, including dozens of rappers and vocalists that include Busta Rhymes, Sly & The Family Stone, The Edgar Winter Group, Roy Orbison, Salt-n-Pepa, Kurt Cobain, Rick Springfield, and Earth, Wind & Fire. The album's divided into fourteen cuts, but it plays as one long blender ride of a record collector's OCD all-night editing orgy. The assembled rhythm tracks align the samples into consistent dance time, but unlike a \"Stars on 45\" production, Girl Talk's head-spinning collage of sound is too hyperkinetic to ever submit to the beat. Whether you're dancing to this in a club or listening to it swirl through your headphones, this is truly as infectious as three hundred hit singles.

The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say \"people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away...\" this is so true, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24\/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a \"slow fade\" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"For former Jewel fans who don't like this CD, tough!  I've never heard anything like this, and my friends agree it's great.\n\n\"Stand\" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.\n\nAnd there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that \"Intuition,\" seems to be \"follow your heart\" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with \"just cash in, sell yourself.\"\n\nThere are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a \"t\" at the end of a word.  In \"Leave The Lights On\" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the \"t\" in \"can't\" so what we actually hear is \"you can try my love, you can buy my love\" instead of \"you can't buy my love.\"\n\nThe second one is in \"Yes U Can.\"  The first time the \"t\" in \"boots\" does come through, but after that it sounds like \"b\".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.  But the \"boots\" are bumpin'.  Apparently it worked.\n\nRight on, Jewel.  Go for it!","classification":5,"fold":2}

The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.\n\nThe three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it.

{"text":"Judging by the reviews left on this song, it seems that many people were introduced to it via the TV show \"Supernatural.\"  While I'd heard the song before, thanks to both my mom (a music nut) and a school bus driver who insisted on keeping the radio on an oldies station all the time, I didn't particularly love it until I, too, started watching \"Supernatural.\"  For a show whose focus was on two brothers hunting demons, vampires, ghosts, and other creepy creatures, it certainly features a LOT of classic rock and older but still awesome music.  And at the end of every season the show plays a recap of the season's events right before the season finale... and said recap is invariably accompanied by this stirring number.\n\nI haven't listened to anything else by Kansas, but if \"Carry On Wayward Son\" is any indication, they were a pretty epic band.  \"Carry On Wayward Son\" balances out the more energetic portions of the song with some slightly slower, more low-key bridges that have an almost thoughtful sound to them, and are mostly piano instead of the guitar-and-drums of the rest.  Not all songs can hit this balance successfully, so props to the songwriters for this.  And while no \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" it is a lot more musically complex than most songs of today.  Whatever happened to these songwriters anyhow...\n\nA classic rock number that's enjoying some newfound popularity thanks to \"Supernatural,\" this is a great song for both classic rock fans and \"Supernatural\" fans to enjoy... or heck, any fans of quality music.  They don't write 'em like this anymore...","classification":5,"fold":2}

For someone who isn't offended by naughty language and doesn't have kids, this is a first.  I hate it when they change words of a song on the radio, but it seems to go better with this song.  This song is very catchy, and this man can really sing, to be honest I'd never heard of him before this song but he's really made his mark as everyone else I know loves this song as well.  The best part is the bridge of the song, where he just starts screaming and crying, it's pretty funny, but it doesn't ruin the song, it gives something extra to it.

{"text":"Tom Carleno's \"Perfect Imperfection\" is a pleasant guitar set.  It a nice soundtrack to let your mind go wandering and thinking about something else, but while the performance level is strong except for some squeaky guitar strings which is a pet peeve of mine, no melodies are particularly memorable.  \"On the Border\" written by Al Stewart is my favorite track on the set.  \"Rhapsody in Blood\" is unsettling with the music not leading into the blood-curdling screams.  I know some will enjoy the track; I did not.  I had to listen closely to John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to recognize the melody.  This is not a bad set, nor a particularly good one.

{"text":"Willie Nelson's colorful album The Great Divide (2002) is a mostly collaborative effort where Willie sings duets with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock, Brian McKnight, Rob Thomas, and others. Actually, the best songs are the ones Willie does solo. The theme here seems to be centered around the challenges of getting older, and surviving the changes life brings us as we age. In the song This Face, Willie sings:\n\nAnd this old heart's been beaten up\nAnd my ragged soul's had things rough\nAnd this face is all I have\n...worn and lived in\n\nThe Great Divide is ambitiously produced (that's a good thing here) with lots of varied instrumentation and musical textures, and it sounds kind of like a pop album with a touch of country. The Willie solo songs Won't Catch Me Crying, The Great Divide, and This Face are all deep, thoughtful and quietly contemplative, and the music fits them perfectly. The best of the duets continue this mood, and they include the somber You Remain (w\/ Bonnie Raitt), the Bernie Taupin penned Mendocino County Line (w\/ Lee Ann Womack), and the very, very enjoyable Don't Fade Away (w\/ Brian McKnight), which is an inspiration to anyone carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders:\n\nDon't fade away\nNothing is what it seems\nYou're lost and in between\nBut you'll find yourself again\n\nThese songs are all very good in a world-weary, but resilient and hopeful way. Be There For You (w\/ Sheryl Crow) and Maria (Shut Up And Kiss Me; w\/ Rob Thomas) are pretty good, too, but Last Stand In Open Country (w\/ Kid Rock) is a good song that could have been better if Willie would have found someone else to sing it with. Nothing against Kid Rock, but as a singer he's a little out of his league here. Willie also does a great solo cover of Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time that works very well. Recollection Phoenix (written by Rob Thomas) is also a very good and thoughtful song that Willie does solo.\n\nThe Great Divide isn't really a classic, but it's a very good country\/pop music album that has some great songs on it, especially if you're a survivor and in the mood for reflective and autumnal themes, and hearing Willie get a little help from his friends.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"With the possible exceptions of Rufus and Sly and the Family Stone, there is virtually no other band to so successfully marry elements of funk, R&B, and pop as Earth Wind & Fire. Their heavy horns, infectious rhythms, and disco overtones are nothing short of an all-out party, and the digital remastering some of their best-loved tracks are granted here make the aural results all the more delicious.\nFunk workouts like \"Shining Star,\" \"Let's Groove,\" \"Boogie Wonderland\" and the classic \"September\" are solid, irresistible works that age like fine wine, and silky ballads like \"That's the Way of the World\" and \"Reasons\" proved that they could be twice as smooth even when the tempo was half as fast. The band even offers up one of the strongest Beatles covers ever recorded, an irresistibly bright reading of \"Got to Get You Into My Life.\" But their hands-down masterpiece will always be \"After the Love is Gone,\" a simply-perfect cut that boasts flawless vocals, lush horns, and a striking chord progression.\nOf the songs that weren't crossover smashes, some are revelations (\"Mighty Mighty,\" \"Saturday Night\") while others simply aren't up to snuff (\"Serpentine Fire,\" \"Kalimba Song\"). Regardless, for a single-disc collection of a supergroup of Earth Wind & Fire's magnitude, you really couldn't do much better.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Partition tries to show that Beyonce' can be as raunchy and oversensual in voice as she was when she came out with Naughty Girl over a decade ago. Yet, for someone who became a new mother a few years ago, maybe she needs to stop showing poorness in her voice, and show motherhood that should have blossomed her soul in her songs better.

{"text":"The lead single of this project, HOLDING YOU DOWN (GOIN' IN CIRCLES)was released last summer and it instantly became a favorite of mine with great use of a sample and a modernized old school feel.  The second single, 10 SECONDS, was released a few months after and featured a soulfully smoldering performance by Jazmine as she calls out a cheating lover.\n\nI thought both singles and they accompanying videos were excellent and hoped that they had created enough \"buzz\" to increase interest in the album upon release.  Unfortunately the album wasn't released until December and shortly after disappointing low sales, Jazmine announced on Twitter that she was quitting the music business (which she later recanted - thankfully).  As an r&b music lover, I understand her pain & frustration about the status of this genre of music but I also believe that if more artists like Jazmine continue to release music that is more soul rather than hip hop\/soul, eventually the pendulum will swing back to a place where she and other singers like her are more appreciated.\n\nI enjoy this album as much as her debut - there are ballads I love that showcase her voice as well as uptempo songs on which she smooths out the raw soul of her voice to fit more \"pop-oriented\" production.  Overall the only 2 songs that I still don't like are: U GET ON MY NERVES w\/ Ne-Yo - the track is just \"ok\" when I hoped for a magical duet between the two voice & FAMOUS - I appreciate the plaintive, honest lyrics but the arrangement of the song makes it difficult to listen to.\n\nOther favorites (in addition to the two singles already released) are:\n\nDON'T MAKE ME WAIT - uptempo track with an 80's retro beat\n\nGOOD ENOUGH - the synthy opening of this ballad segues into a Prince-sounding track with Jazmine's emotional & raw vocals\n\nSTUTTERING & EXCUSE ME - smoky ballads\n\nLOVE YOU LONG TIME - interesting military drum beats used on this uptempo track make it interesting\n\nREDEMPTION SONG - great storytelling lyrics, Jazmine raps then goes into a killer chorus\n\nI wish her label would release one more track but sadly these days r&b artists usually only release 1 or 2 tracks and then we hear that the artist is \"working on the next album\" - they just don't take time to groom artists or \"grow\" their music anymore if it doesn't crossover to the mainstream charts.\n\nTo Jazmine, as a fan I say, please stay strong and continue to release good music!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Coming into fame as a comedic actor, Jamie Foxx has expanded his horizons to take on a variety of dramatic roles. As a singer who's taken the opportunity to perform in works such as the musical film 'Dreamgirls', his interests include neo-soul styles as well as club-focused hip-hop and even a bit of new jack swing. This album doesn't just bring him together with collaborators such as Kanye West and T.I., though, but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production.\n\nFoxx's scattershot approach could've made for a well-rounded album, but it feels more like a mixed bag than anything. Some tracks have a particular appeal to them while others seem more average than anything. \"Blame It\" became a major radio hit at the time of release, although as a pop rap single it's nothing special. Foxx's vocal abilities shine far better in songs such as the Boyz II Men style emotional ballads \"Rainman\" and \"Why\", the two of which alone make the album worth picking up.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"As Phil and Co. have stated, \"The Purple EP\" will be the first of four, each to highlight a different element of the band's sound.  This is officially supposed to be the \"heavy\" one, sparking a buzz (so to speak) with Down fans.  All six songs are intended to concentrate on the more in-your-face, upbeat, energetic side of Down.\n\nFor this reason, some are comparing it to NOLA.  That's not a bad comparison, but I'm hearing a little of everything that makes Down heavy.  The first track, Levitation, starts with a slow, doomy crawl, before shifting into an up-tempo metal vibe reminiscent of Down II.  Next, Witchtripper steps up the pace with a Sabbath-inspired headbanger that could've been on NOLA.  Track three, Open Coffins, gets slower, with a mix of doom and bluesy metal that would fit on any Down album.  The Curse Is A Lie continues in similar fashion, with plenty of Iommi-like riffs, some that crunch and others that soar, but with an underpinning of mid-paced doom.  This Work Is Timeless is a true Down stomper; short, sweet, and full of muscle.  The last song, Misfortune Teller is a seven-minute epic spanning nearly every aspect of Down's metal roots.  It's a powerful way to end the first installment of Down IV.\n\nIn the vocal department, Phil sounds like Phil.  He hasn't varied too much on any release aside from dropping the screams that characterized NOLA, and you won't hear many on this.  On Down III, I thought he sounded a little thin, like he'd lost some of the power behind his singing voice.  On this EP, he sounds more like he did on Down II.  The bellow is there, as well as the nuance Phil has always injected, making him one of metal's most compelling vocalists.  Basically, getting this EP is a no-brainer if you like Down, doom, sludge, heavy rock, or metal.  You really can't go wrong with these guys.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"For much of my 17 years of Grateful Dead fandom I was, admittedly, what Deadheads refer to as a 60's & 70's snob. Out of my massive collection of live tapes and Dick's Picks, only a handful were from the Brent Mydland years of '79-'90 or later. It took me rediscovering--five or six years back--1990's 'Without A Net,' with it's excellent versions of \"Bird Song\" and \"Eyes of the World,\" for me to rethink my stance. Through Archive.org, I've now come to appreciate every era of the Dead, and I believe the Spring 1990 tour to be their most consistently stellar since '77. They've had other runs in that span that may have had higher  peaks but, with this tour, one could basically pick any show at random to listen to and it's virtually guaranteed to be a winner.\n\n'Spring 1990: So Glad You Made It'--a compilation whittled down from the 18-disc box set released last month--is an excellent companion piece to the aforementioned 'Without A Net,' featuring highlights from six of the best shows in March. We finally get an official release of the legendary Albany \"Loser\" from March 24th, and the Brent Mydland-sung \"Blow Away\" from March 16th in Landover, MD. Brent, without a doubt, had the best pure singing voice of anyone in the Dead at this point, and its a shame he died a few scant months after these shows. Even though he was their longest tenured keyboardist, I would love to have heard more from him, considering the band were in the middle of a live mini-renaissance beginning the year prior, which was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death. He's one of the most talented backing keyboardists of all-time, imo, even if it did take me a while to get used to the (at times) \"carnival-ish\" sound of his keys.\n\nElsewhere we get 14-plus minute versions of \"Bird Song\" and \"Eyes\" that rival 'Without a Net's.' I know it's hard to top Branford Marsalis's sax-laden version of \"Eyes,\" but I almost prefer this one, as Jerry's precise noodling comes through more, along with the interweaving of the various instruments. Then again I could just be burnt out on the other due to a ridiculous amount of repeated listens. The \"Jack-a-Roe\" is one of the best electric versions I've heard, and Bob sounds positively possessed on one of the more exploratory latter-day \"Estimated Prophet\"s. Also included is one of the most powerful, heartfelt \"Morning Dew\"s of the era, which slowly builds and builds, Jerry pouring his soul into each and every verse until the song erupts into all-out bliss.\n\nThe only negative for me is that the sound-quality is a little underwhelming--with less clarity and less \"oomph\" in the bass compared with other releases--though it's still loads better than any soundboard tape you can get from this tour. It's just weird to me that I have many 40 year-old, 2-track live recordings of the Dead that sound crisper than these 22 year-old shows. I know the band recorded some of their 80's and 90's shows straight to cassette as opposed to reel to reel, which affected the sound-quality in some cases. I'm not sure if that's the case here, but it's still just a minor complaint, as it's definitely better than most live albums by other bands from this era.\n\n'Spring 1990: So Glad You Made It' is absolutely essential for Deadheads, and for fans of just-plain great music in general. You get the best of both worlds here--from upbeat, head-bobbin' numbers to deeper, more tripped-out jams--and therefore it would serve as a great introduction to later-period Dead, if you are (like I once was) hesitant to explore this era. It still blows my mind that, with the wealth of live material released year after year by this band, that there are still these amazing gems that are just now getting released.\n\nAnd I have a feeling that these past 20 years of archival releases may be just the tip of the iceberg. I may not be the religious sort, but...thank God for the Grateful \"goshdarn\" Dead.","classification":4,"fold":2}

I've seen him live from 6th street at Antone's to years later on the G3 tour in NYC. But this album is nothing special. There's no one tune that stands out and grabs me. There is some good playing here but over all just sort of a so so experience. Was hoping for more after the usual long hiatus. Still, if you're a fan then it's worth having. Just don't expect to be blown away. Nothing like \"Ah Via Musicom\". Production and Engineering are quite good though and up to his usual standards. Sounds good on a good system. Might have given it 3 1\/2 if the option was available. We'll see. Maybe it will grow on me. But so far \"Venus Ilse\" and \"Bloom\" are far superior and this is turning into my least favorite studio album from him.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"For Twelve Reasons To Die, Ghostface Killah's tenth studio album, he combines efforts with producer Adrian Younge to tell a unique story of love and revenge. RZA narrates the album in brilliant form, and the Wu Tang flavor is very much alive all throughout the album whether it comes from RZA's narration and executive production or guest appearances from emcees such as Masta Killa, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Killa Sin and Cappadonna among others. Twelve Reasons To Die is not a very long collection of songs, but what it does offer will leave the listener tremendously satisfied. In other words, quality is more important than quantity here. The whole album is smart and nothing less than classic, hardcore Ghostface. His flow, rhymes, energy and timing are just as superb if not better than before, and he is still true to his roots.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"quik is one of the best technical sounding Producers and he always kept a groove and of course i dug the old triangle base he came out of with. problem is he is recycling a third tier version of stuff he did better back in the day. bringing back  El Debarge, Rob Funksta Bacon,Suga Free  doesn't lite the fuse as rhythmlism did back in 98.  to  me  he has been  hit and miss for a long time now. you get the occasional decent or party fun cut. humor still is good,though this album feels phoned in. still good to see still putting out albums and he is one of the most underrated figures in Rap Music,however he has done way better.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"The 9th album from this U.K. band projects a subtle sort of edgy, nervous tension thats surrounded and engulfed by a soaring swirl of magnanimous and expansive, gloriously radiant beauty with a near-religious fervor.  Thom Yorkes voice implores all the little gods of the universe with its slurred open-wound fragility.  Classical lounge piano and orchestrated choral clouds of mystic-threaded magic intertwine with haunted acoustic guitars and motorik rhythmic soundscape atmospheres.  As usual, Radioheads music both confuses & intrigues, as it vacillates from sleepy monotony to stimulating electric jolts of sound.  On A Moon Shaped Pool the band reaches for an alternate audio reality of hypnotic sophistication.  Whether they ultimately find it will depend on your interpretation of the energy & flow.  Either way, its a stellar effort.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"This new Cash album is a short but fitting epilogue to his story, although it seems likely that there will be more posthumous releases to come, judging from what's already been put out in the years since his passing.  There's barely half an hour of music on Ain't No Grave, but the collection of songs hangs together well around the theme of looking back at a life well lived, and readying oneself for what comes next.  The packaging is well designed too, with the similing young Johnny on the cover, and a ghostly image on back of the elder Cash at a window.  As far as the music itself, I will tip my hat to an excellent Calgary Herald review of the album, where it is pointed out that Cash's vocals are shakier than ever on this final recording.  It's perfectly understandable given his condition when the recordings were made, but I still found it distracting in many places, and it did reduce my enjoyment of the songs somewhat.  On some tunes, such as \"Satisfied Mind,\" he sounds good and relatively strong, but on others he seemed to just barely have enough breath to get the words out.  It's not just the weak and ragged tone on many songs that bothered me, but also the frequently slurred diction.  I respect those who can love Johnny's singing no matter how diminished it might be, but I can't quite go that far.\n\nI was also frustrated by the lack on information about how this album was made.  The booklet gives us samples of Johnny's handwritten notes and song lyrics for \"I Corinthians 15:55,\" the one original song on the CD that he wrote.  That's interesting, but I would also like to know how these recordings were assembled.  For example, I assume Cash's vocals were recorded separately and all the instruments were all added long afterwards, but is that what happened?  Maybe this is one of those sausage-making situations, but I do want to know what went into the creation of Ain't No Grave.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"It was about a week ago that I saw Mary J. Blige on PBS speaking to Tavis Smiley about her newest album. In fact,it seems as if there's been a lot of output by her of late. During the course of the interview? Mary hit on a very important point that has been at the core of much of my opinion of her now very musically rich back catalog of studio albums. She spoke about realizing that a lot of her music was too bound by beats and samples. And that the focus wasn't as much on the core of her own musical talent. With the likes of newer British artists such as Emeli Sande' and this years big breakout Sam Smith? Mary J made the decision to record in London with these and other modern artists on the UK club\/soul scene with producer Rodney Jerkins. The results say something to me that I've never quite heard from Mary J.Blige.\n\n  The album opens with \"Therapy\",a mid-tempo song driven almost totally by the percussive acapella doo-wop style vocal pops and hiccups from Sam Smith himself. \"Doubt\" comes at a gospel driven number featuring only the accompaniment of piano and backup vocals. \"Not Loving You\", \"When Your Gone\" and the closer \"Worth My Time\" are all slower songs with the same type of solo piano backing-all conceptually following a similar conceptual arc of the cycles of external and internal loss of love. \"Right Now\" mixes backwards tapes loops,buzzing synth bass and dreamy electronics for a grooving modern techno funk jam with a catchy vocal chorus. \"My Loving\",the electric piano charged \"Nobody But You\" and the synth bass driven \"Follow\",featuring Disclosure are all club friendly and somewhat jazzy house\/dance jams. \"Pick Me Up\" adds a brighter melody and a ragtime style trumpet playing on the choruses.\n\n  \"Long Hard Look\" is a an interesting mix of modern mid-tempo gospel\/soul and arena friendly pop\/rock accents while \"Whole Damn Year\",with it's jazzier soul atmospherics yet again,finds Mary being brutally honest about her apparently still troubled psyche. As with every Mary J. Blige album? This presents an artist viewing themselves as a constant work in progress in their personal life. That being said? The stripped down approach of this album does focus in on Mary's earnest voice,which sounds almost more soulful here than I've ever heard it. What keeps this from being her very best album,at least for me,is the fact that most of these songs simply lack funk. Mary has always been a funky,uptempo friendly artist. And I happen to know she's more than capable of mixing strong melody and vocals with that groove. Most of the songs here are basically the top of the metaphorical musical muffin,as it were. At the same time? The musical surface Mary presents here does go deep with soul. If she chooses to channel a similar approach to this with thicker,phatter grooves? Than she might have her full on musical masterpiece album on her hands.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"There really isn't much to be said about Nirvana's breakthrough album \"Nevermind\" that hasn't already been said hundreds of times before.  Twelve years ago when this album came out, it sent a shockwave across the musical landscape and helped set forward the grunge movement.  The massive success of the single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" catapaulted Nirvana to a never before imagined status; and ultimately helped set the stage of lead singer\/songwriter Kurt Cobain's untimely demise.  All the hype that still surrounds this album aside, \"Nevermind\" is one heck of a rock record.  \"In Bloom\" and \"Come As You Are\" became instant rock radio classics, while other tracks like \"Lithium\", \"Polly\", \"Lounge Act\", and \"Something in the Way\" are nothing short of amazing pure unadulterated hard rock.

And while I have yet to watch \"Highlander\" (I know, I'm a bad nerd...), I heard snippets of the song made famous by it, and decided it was worth a download.\n\nWhile not Queen's most famous song, \"Princes of the Universe\" is a fantastic song by the band, and deserves to be more well-known.  It has the signature Queen sound, part rock and part metal, and all energetic and blood-pumping.  The lyrics get a little lost in the instrumentation from time to time, but if you listen carefully the song is sung from the point of view of one of the film's immortal warriors.  And thankfully, one doesn't have to be familiar with the movie to enjoy said lyrics.\n\nA must-have track if you're a Queen fan, but also worth a listen if you're only casually familiar with them.

But, Pearcy has always delivered in the studio.  What disappointed me in the last few Ratt releases was the guitar tone and below par songs (some of that because of the guitar tone\/style).  Past albums had very twangy, more bluesy, and not crisp and crunchy guitars.  Here we get the good old Ratt-N-Roll crisp and crunchy guitar work.  Great rhythm parts and classic Ratt leads.  Carlos Cavaso really assisted in the dual guitar attack in a way that makes the songs good but doesnt change them from having the signature Ratt sound... he allows DeMartini to shine.  They sounded better in concert with Cavaso than they have in years and the same is true with this album.  Ratt has said this is like an album that could have come in the same era as their classic Out of the Cellar and Invasion of Your Privacy and they are right.  It is classic Ratt with modern production.  It is everything they said it would be and then some.  It is nice to see a CD live up to expectations.

{"text":"At the invitation of the Kremlin, Billy Joel took the first large-scale rock tour to the Soviet Union in 1987, performing his greatest hits in Tbilisi, Moscow, and Leningrad as a good-will ambassador to a nation in the throes of change. In doing so, he became one of the powerful cultural influences that brought about the dissolution of that nation. Gorbachev introduced perestroika in 1986 and added glasnost in 1988, so Joel's concerts were of a piece with the new freedoms and opening to the West that transformed the Soviet bloc.\n\nThere are several ways to buy the concerts: as a two-cd set, as a DVD or Blu-ray, or in deluxe editions which pair a DVD or Blu-ray with the CDs. The audio recordings present 11 tracks that weren't on the original LP, called simply \"Concert,\" while the deluxe video discs include seven songs not on the original VHS release, entitled \"Live From Leningrad,\" as well as a documentary about the tour. The sound and picture are excellent, as are the performances of Billy and his band. Although he strained his voice a bit early on in the tour, he managed to overcome the problem and put on exciting, energetic shows.\n\nThe 75-minute Showtime documentary makes a strong argument for buying one of the deluxe editions. It captures the warmth, intimacy, excitement, and chaos of the tour, offering not only numerous clips from the concerts but also behind-the-scenes activities, a travelogue, and meetings with Russians. The many people involved (family, band, crew, producer, translator, and others) reflect on the pains and pleasures of the experience. Billy took his then-wife Christie Brinkley and baby daughter Alexa along; young Russians embraced them wholeheartedly and they reciprocated the feelings. The deluxe booklet contains new essays and archival photos.\n\nI really enjoyed this set. It takes you back to one of the peaks of Billy Joel's career, and it remains a vital historical document.","classification":5,"fold":2}

I only got Gavin's new CD because I really didn't know that it was a pop record.  I read his article in the July issue of Keyboard magazine and convinced myself he might be worth listening to.  He talked about artists like Jeff Beck and Van Morrison.  He talked about making inspiring records like his influences had.  Keyboard's staff writer declared that this kid was a supreme songwriter who was devoted to his craft.  Although  \"Chariot\" was a shot in the dark I'd say my expectations were right on the mark.  I immediately drew a comparison to the immortal Jeff Buckley.  Gavin can sing, and his voice truely saved this album from being another pop record.  But as for being a great songwriter I think I would have liked a little more instrumental integrity and variety; his straight forward rock riffs won't get him very far with music fans like me.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I remember hearing More Than A Feeling on a Saturday morning in the Fall of 1976, in our station wagon as my Mom drove me to gymnastics class. I liked the song so much that it caused me to make my first and worst mail order record purchase. The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.\n\nI finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay\/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?\n\nLater on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I gave it a few weeks before logging into amazon and posting an impuslive review of this cd. I have lived in Las Vegas for 8 years, and have always hated the kids here (Meaning hardcore, punk, emo, alternative rock kids, etc). That's why I was surprised when I heard the Killers first CD. While I liked Hot Fuss a lot, there were only a few songs that I kept in my Itunes library. There were a lot of throwaway songs I thought. On This CD, almost every song is good. I fell in love with the \"When you were young\" song and was not let down on the rest. It's a good cd that reminds me of every band I've ever loved put in a blender. I hear the Misfits sometimes (just a little), the Smiths, Depeche Mode. Sometimes it sounds like Placebo. It has almost a religious, weird choir music feel to it at times which I think is great. People say it sounds like Bruce Springsteen. I don't hear that, but whatever. If you're not a judgmental indie rock nerd who wants to put down a great band because you're unable to produce music this good, buy this cd.

{"text":"Kreayshawn became an internet sensation in the summer of 2011 with her hit song \"Gucci Gucci\" and has since been known perhaps for her controversies than for her music. The rare white female rapper will typically be known as a novelty act (anyone remember Sarai??) even if she is able to deliver strong beats, witty raps, and clever hooks. Lady Sovereign is one exception.\n\nAnd several songs do deliver. \"Go Hard\" and \"K234ys0nixz\" (pronounced \"Kreay-sonic\" as if it really makes a difference) are two examples of this. But there are a number of wretched tracks too, such as \"Luv Haus\" which closes the album on a poor note. Bottom line, this album was released way too late, and it only sold 3900 copies in its first week, and it contains far too little interesting material for the mainstream listener. Unlike Lady Sovereign, the only white female rapper who has not completely faded from public consciousness after one song or album, Kreayshawn just does not deliver enough good stuff here to be taken seriously. 2.5 stars.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"When I first heard this song, I was a little let down. But as I got into the lyrics, I did feel better. The lyrics are pretty good and a bit more mature then many previous efforts. It was hard for me to pinpoint, but it seems the production is a bit off. Maybe the production was a bit to heavy, and should have focused on the song itself more. I do not dislike the song, I guess it's just expectations.  I do think it is a top 10 song, but is not the super dance smash like some of her others. Hopefully, the remixes will be as good as always. (Kelly Clarkson for example-remixes as great as original cut)\n\nThis is the \"season\" of the big releases. Lady Gaga is also releasing new material, as has Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus. Here's looking forward to some great tunes being released in the next 4 months\n\nBottom line, a good song worth purchasing. A blockbuster? Maybe not, but if you put it on a playlist with \"I Will Survive\", \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\", and \"Stronger(What Doesn't Kill You)\" you will get a feeling for the theme. The lades will like this song.\n\nIt will be interesting. I do not like reviewing \"pop idols\" too much. If you give a non-5 star review, the rabid fans go nuts and shoot it down. But if you look at the guidelines for reviews, you write what you think. I did purchase this, and listen too it.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Five MEMORABLE Stars! As the early days of Rock n Roll were unfolding, starring such scorching uptempo rockers as Chuck Berry, Bill Haley and the Comets, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis, there were also groups who were very successful singing ballads. One such group was The Platters, who could go uptempo, but sold millions of records singing songs that were mostly from the Great American Songbook. Thus they created great hits which reverberate to this day: \"Twilight Time\", \"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\", and \"Red Sails In The Sunset\". They also sang ballads unique to them like \"Only You\", \"The Great Pretender\", and \"I'm Sorry\".\n\nOne of their hits was a unique version of \"Harbor Lights\" with the captivating 20 second introduction and ending which includes the sounds of ocean tides, a fog horn, ship's bell, seagull's, swirling violins, and a french horn\/oboe before The Platters enter. And when they do, the marvelous, emotional voice of lead singer Tony Williams states the lyrics with the soothing background group of Zola Taylor, David Lynch, Paul Robi, and Herb Reed backed by strings, flutes, and ukulele.

{"text":"LOTUSFLOW3R.  One of the Purple One's most diverse efforts, which wouldn't mean that it's necessarily good--but in fact it's one of his most exciting albums, dancing through future noir jazz (\"From the Lotus...\") to modern urban blues (\"Colonized Mind\") into Seventies-style R&B (\"Feel Good, Feel Better, Feel Wonderful\") and out through vaguely Hendrixian guitar anthem (\"Dreamer\").  It shines like an aquatic kingdom of rock and soul, sounds the part, too, painting Prince as some sort of interstellar pop king of Neptune.  And he resurrects the hell out of \"Crimson and Clover.\"  B+\n\nMPLSOUND.  It was anticipated as a return to the sound of his \"Purple Rain\" days, which it kind of is.  More so, Mr. Nelson takes a few lines from his Revolution-era songbook and then adapts his music for the modern music scene, where beat-driven hip-hop rules.  \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\" is kind of groovy, but the dark beat of \"Chocolate Box\" hits closer to the mark.  The rest are all close enough to the bullseye to be interesting, but Prince doesn't seem to care much about hitting the mark, as though he was watching a girl behind the bar while he's tossing the darts.  Good for when you're in the party mood, but \"1999\" is better--and for that matter, so is \"Purple Rain.\"  For inspiration: \"I like it when you dance 4 me.\"  B\n\nBria Valente: ELIXIR.

{"text":"Mark Knopfler's seventh solo album is his first double-CD release, but the quality and diversity of its 20 original songs amply justify issuing two discs. He toured Europe with Bob Dylan last year and will tour with him in North America this fall, so it's tempting to speculate that working alongside the world's most eminent living songwriter may have sharpened Mark's game and made him more prolific. (They've been playing and recording together off and on since 1979.)\n\nIn interviews, Knopfler likens traveling with a band to sailing the world with a crew of brigands, which is what privateers once did during times of war. They were authorized by governments to attack foreign cargo ships, plundering them for booty in order to weaken the enemy. They didn't sink vessels, only commandeered them, and this is akin to what Mark and his band do when they play, capturing new fans who who join those that have followed him since the days of Dire Straits.\n\nThe songs on \"Privateering\" are consistently low-key, character-driven, beautifully written stories of scoundrels on the run and people on the down-and-out, including the opening track, \"Redbud Tree\": \"I crouch in dread \/ Discovery my certain death \/ Her leaves reaching for my head \/ As I suspend my breath \/ Redbud tree shelter me, shelter me.\"\n\nThe song \"Haul Away\" introduces a nautical sound, complete with a Celtic penny whistle, fiddle, and accordion, and a theme of lost love. The album then shifts to a great blues tune, \"Don't Forget Your Hat,\" featuring steel slide guitar and harmonica: \"Look out the window \/ Never saw so much rain \/ You better get down to the station \/ If you wanna catch that train \/ So long, I guess that's that \/ Hey hey, don't forget your hat.\"\n\nFrom trains, Knopfler returns to a song of the sea on the title track, which makes it clear that privateers were little better than pirates. The charmingly simple \"Miss You Blues\" follows (though it's not actually a blues), as does the gently rocking \"Corn Beef City,\" a truck-driving song that reflects the hard economic times we're living through: \"You don't ask questions when there's nothing in the bank \/ You gotta feed the kids and put the diesel in the tank.\"\n\nAs one might expect, \"Go, Love\" is a sad song of farewell, while \"Hot or What\" switches back to the blues for some amusing first-person braggin' and harmonica blowin' from a lucky gambler. The first CD closes with \"Yon Two Crows,\" the tale of a muddy shepherd, and the touching, evocative \"Seattle,\" about a pair of disillusioned dreamers in my rainy hometown: \"I still believe that there's somewhere for us \/ But now it's something that we don't discuss \/ You're the best thing I ever knew \/ Stay with me, baby, and we'll make it to \/ Seattle.\"\n\nOpening disc two is a second Celtic melody entitled \"Kingdom of Gold.\" Its lyrics describe the dire fate of buccaneers who attack a powerful medieval king: \"His axes and armor will conquer these devils \/ The turbulent raiders will falter and fall \/ Their leaders be taken, their camps burned and leveled \/ They'll hang in the wind from his citadel walls.\"\n\nNext up is \"Got to Have Something,\" a basic blues tune about whiskey and guns, succeeded by the wistful, jazz-tinged \"Radio City Serenade,\" a nostalgic love song to New York City, and \"I Used to Could,\" a lively honky-tonk number about a bad boy and his GMC Cannonball truck. \"Gator Blood\" is Southern-fried roots music with wailing pedal steel guitar, while \"Bluebird\" is another melancholy blues about a farmer who's run out of luck. The beautiful gloom continues with \"Dream of the Drowned Submariner\" and \"Blood and Water,\" but Knopfler finally allows us a bit of happiness on the blues shuffle \"Today Is OK,\" in which a boxer addresses his girlfriend:\n\n\"Baby, you can read my mind \/ I'll be home just after nine\nYou're the best medicine I know \/ Tonight we're gonna let it all go\nPut on that pretty silk shirt \/ Put on that tight black skirt\nPut on those heels so black \/ We can party on when I get back\"\n\nThe album ends with a cute bit of Americana that looks at Jack \"After the Bean Stalk.\" Like much of \"Privateering,\" it's country and bluesy, warm and wry. Nothing flashy, just good, comfortable music you can relax into.","classification":4,"fold":2}

A serious question, but is [by any chance] Jorn front man \/ vocalist Jorn Lande (formerly of Ark, Old Funeral, Hydra) by any chance Ronnie James biological son?

{"text":"The Good\n\"Call to Arms\" is no doubt the band's anthem for this album. A major difference you notice right away is that this album is a lot brighter and hopeful as compared to their 2006 album We Don't Need to Whisper. \"Everything's Magic\" adds a hint of keyboards and lots of progressive effects that complement Tom Delonge's (ex-Blink 182) melodic, high-pitched vocals. \"Breathe\" is not your typical radio ballad, but more like a sci-fi movie love song. Driving guitars mixed with melodic vocal breaks make up the track \"Secret Crowds.\" Drummer Atom Willard (Offspring) experiments with some unique drum beats on this one. \"True Love\" employs electronic drum beats, unique guitar licks, and uplifting vocals.\n\nThe Bad\nDespite the different effects and drum beats used, the album tends to sound like one long, drawn-out song.\n\nThe Verdict\nThe brighter more optimistic Angles and Airwaves are far more enjoyable than their darker and hopeless debut.

It's a hysterical song and video, but the tune is great. Anyone who's ever lived a time in their life when money was tight will get a kick out of it and can appreciate its meaning.

{"text":"The Bird and the Bee (aka Greg Kurstin and Inara George) is one of the few bands in existence who can cover a great song and make it their own.\n\nSo it was pretty much inevitable that someday they'd put out a cover album -- in this case, \"Interpreting The Masters Volume 1: A Tribute To Daryl Hall And John Oates.\" It's pretty much what you'd expect after their past covers: a string of Hall and Oates' hit songs, which have metamorphosed into sensual, delicate electronic pop with angelic vocals.\n\nWell, it goes without saying that the songwriting is excellent. Each Hall & Oates song that Kurstin and George selected seems to have a different kind of romantic relationship in it: love-that-wasn't, a lover who craves too much, love for a \"Rich Girl,\" a hot-and-cold romance, a lovelorn request for a smile, and even an ode to a \"lean and hungry\" \"Maneater.\" Lots of complex, bittersweet feelings.\n\nAnd it kicks off with the funky, twittery sounds of \"Heard it on the Radio,\" with George singing sweetly, \"When we first met\/It wasn't what you said\/And still I loved you like mad... Now every time\/I hear it playing\/I think of you\/And those summer days.\"\n\nFrom there on, the band bounces merrily into the sprightly \"Rich Girl,\" the sharp-edged \"I Can't Go For That,\" the slow sensual \"Sarah Smile,\" the flowing electropop of \"Kiss on my List,\" the shimmering \"She's Gone,\" and the delicate finale \"One on One.\" They even get into the clubbier stuff with the sexually-charged, beat-heavy \"Maneater.\"\n\nDon't worry, the songs have the same infectious, fun melodies as the original Hall & Oates versions... more or less. Greg Kurstin just does to them what he does to any song that The Bird and the Bee covers -- he spins a delicate web of shimmering keyboard over every song, and backs it up with some squidgy guitars, drums, xylophone, organ and haunting flickers of floating synth.\n\nInara Geoge has a beautifully flexible voice, which always seems to be wavering between huskiness and sweetness. And she sounds like she's having a lot of fun in this album, adding her own funky feminine flavor to time-honored pop songs -- it ends up sounding like the confessions of a strong-willed girl who's loved fast, hard and passionately, and has sometimes ended up with a heart that's been cracked rather than broken.\n\n\"Interpreting the Masters, Vol. 1: A Tribute to Daryl Hall & John Oates\" is exactly what it sounds like -- the Bird and the Bee's deliciously vibrant covers of their classic songs. Catchy and sweet.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Let me state upfront that I wasn't aware of the Black Angels until a friend of mine, who knows my musical tastes quite well, directed me to them with this, their second album. I would not be not disappointed. (I confess that I have not heard the band's first album, 2006's \"Passover\", yet at this time, but I will seek that out shortly.)\n\n\"Directions to See a Ghost\" (11 tracks; 71 min.) starts off with a blast, \"You On The Run\", which at first reminds me immediately of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, but then the song evolves. \"Doves\" kicks off with thundering drums, only to be joined by even more thundering guitars, awash in reverb, just great. \"Science Killer\" starts with a great bass line, and eventually works into a frenzy, just great. \"Mission District\" reminded me of early Pink Floyd (Syd Barret-era). The energy throughout the album is fantasic, shoe-glazing psychedelic-influenced music at its best (and it's not a coincidence that the Black Angels are now on the same label as Brian Jonestown Massacre). Other highlights for me include the hard-charging \"Vikings\" and the closer, a 16 min. epic \"Snake In the Grass\" which goes on forever, but you never want it to end anyway, fabulous. In all, this album is just great, and sure to make my \"best of the year\" list.\n\nPlease note that simultaneously with the album, the band released an EP \"Black Angel Exit\" (4 tracks; 24 min.), which you could get by pre-ordering the album, or now at the band's shows (which is where I got it). It is a great companion to (and in the same vein as) the album, with the 9+ min. title track as the highlight. I had the good fortune to catch the Black Angels in concert here in Cincinnati recently in support of the new album, and they were nothing short of fantastic, a delight for any fan of live music. Meanwhile, \"Directions to See a Ghost\" is HIGHLY recommended!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"There is no question that Bruce Springsteen has always been one of a kind, not just in his music, but simply of how his messages are in song, not just because they are great, but they just do not lose their simplicity. While the music from Born In The U.S.A. was supreme in the 80's, the music out of his Tunnel Of Love album shows just how much Bruce really rose to supreme heights, but also the end of his first marriage ending, and finding a love anew with his wife of over 25 years Patti Scalfa. One Step Up is definitely a great song, and one of Bruce's underrated gems of his that came out of the 80's. I definitely love the song not just because it is brilliant and simple, he shows a nice heart into his words and appeal. We really do not have great artists in this era like the reign of \"The Boss.\" This is a great download for die hard Bruce Springsteen ans, and newcomers of this era alike.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":2}

The song isn't that good, but it honestly is better than the other ones she came out with for her record. It honestly is better than the ones Britney Spears made for her record, Circus or the single Madonna had made, Celebration. While I still am admit she does need to find a better edge to her snapshots, Lady Gaga pull a interesting rabbit out of the hat with this song.

The One, her second single from the album actually is a fairly good rhythm, which I found very catchy and driven. Yet, my one big gripe about the song isn't about the style, the song actually was a bit short and could've been a bit longer in heart. Tamar still has a long to find herself.

{"text":"Welcome To Our House is the second album from Slaughterhouse. I bought their first, self titled album and I wasn't overly impressed. It wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't make me want to go back and listen to it again and again. This album on the other hand is a completely different story. It's been out for roughly six months and I'm still listening to it to this day.\nSlaughterhouse released five singles before the album dropped. The first of the four was \"Hammer Dance\". They came out the gates with their guns blazing, as this wasn't only one of the best songs on the album, but one of the best rap songs of 2012. The Araab Music-Produced \"Hammer Dance\" fits all four of the rapper's flows flawlessly and allows all four to spit some of the best verses we've heard from any of them. The second song unfortunately wasn't the same story. \"My Life\" featuring Cee-Lo Green almost seems like a song the record label forced on them just for mainstream appeal. The song follows the structure of most hip-pop songs now-a-days and just feels kind of generic overall. \"Throw It Away\" isn't really single material but it did turn out to be a nice banger. \"Goodbye\" was a nice addition to the mix as most of the other songs on the album turned out to be bangers, it's nice to get a little variety in the mix. \"Throw That\" stands out as one of the highlights from the album. The frantic, all over the place beat works well with the humorous lyrics, and the Eminem feature was fantastic as we get almost a glimpse of his \"Just Lose It\" days.\nWhat really amazes me about this album is that there was really only one other song that stands out amongst the rest as one of the best songs the album has to offer. That song would be \"Frat House\" The T-Minus-produced song is absolutely nuts and lets all four of the rappers spit some seriously raw lines. As for the rest of the album, there wasn't really a song that wasn't worth listening to. In fact, even the Deluxe Edition of the album was great. Aside from the interludes every song is good by it's own merits.\nDon't get me wrong, the album isn't perfect. It could use a little more variety, and some of the songs feel repetitious due to using the same song structures. But those are just nit-picks. The album is absolutely fantastic and I can't recommend enough to any rap fan.\n\n9\/10\n\nMust Download Songs:\n\nFrat House\nGoodbye\nHammer Dance\nThrow That\nThrow It Away\nWalk Of Shame\nPlace To Be\nThe Other Side","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Honestly? What happened to the song I hear on the radio? The version I WANTED????\nThis is the only version by the group offered by Amazon and I'm sorry but IF I WANTED A RAP SONG, I'D BUY A RAP ALBUM. They have a great melody, catchy lyrics...it's great. But THIS version is at least half rap. And that just ruined it for me. Completely.\n\nJust...NO.\n\nI'm being generous with my 2 stars...right now I'm feeling that I've purchased musical vandalism. This sort of bait & switch is inexcusable. Usually you can tell when a great song has been ruined by a needless remix with a random rap artist, and I completely understand that some people like it. They think it's edgy or modern or hip or whatever. And that's great that there is an alternate for them. But if you just want the song to be SUNG, it seems to be an impossibility.\n\nIf a band releases a song to the radio, THAT version should at least be available for purchase.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting \"Fourteen\" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's \"Fall For You.\"\n\nThis piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.\n\nSo overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"Another superb album by Arcade Fire. \"The Suburbs\" won best album of the year at the Grammy's a few years ago and I 100% agree. I enjoy every song, even \"Rococo\" (strange lyrics but awesome music). Win Butler has a great voice, it's full of emotion and melody. How can you not feel something on tracks like: \"Modern Man\", \"We Used to Wait, \"Deep Blue,\", \"Ready to Start\", and the title track? The answer is, you can't. He has this special, rare quality to his music that you can't fake or manufacture. Beautiful album by a beautiful band. \"The Suburbs\" is a meaningful and unforgettable album. I listen to it all the time. And I don't care what people say, I also like their latest album, \"Everything Now\". I appreciate that the band are not afraid to change up their sound with each studio album. So with that being said, I recommend ALL 5 of their studio albums, but start with \"The Suburbs\" - it's their most groundbreaking. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":2}

I keep my MP3 downloads on amazon cloud, and move tracks over to my iPhone for listening during my morning walk. I like that these latest boxes are compilations of many composers, as it offers built-in variety to accommodate my daily exercise routine.\n\nNew to this set is the New World Symphony in a performance by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under Vladimir Goldschmamm. It's a performance with a few quirky interpretive gestures, and the first movement has a few problems with the sound quavering. Worth a listen if not a top-ten performance.\n\nThe Beethoven Symphonies included here that are conducted by Sir Adrian Boult and the Schubert Symphonies conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras are really quite good.\n\nRecommended.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"The very notion of reviewing an album of this magnitude after one or two or even three listens is absurd, but this is the internet, so we must rush to make our voices heard.\n\nAfter purchasing the deluxe edition directly from the band's website and downloading the album in WAV format, I played the album front to back on my headphones. My expectations were quite lofty after having already heard the first two tracks (\"Burn the Witch\" and \"Daydreaming\"). Shockingly, the album just got better and better from there. From the fantastic guitar solo in \"Identikit\" to the haunting strings to the absolutely gorgeous studio rendition of \"True Love Waits\" that we've all been waiting for, this is an album that satisfies on first listen and begs to be heard again and again.\n\nThis is a gorgeous piece of music that rewards each subsequent listen. Each song builds on the last until the complete emotional outpouring of \"True Love Waits.\" My only complaint thus far is that it doesn't quite feel like a cohesive album as opposed to a collection of carefully arranged beautiful music, but I'm not sure that's actually a complaint. Heck, Radiohead may have just redefined exactly what an album is.\n\nIt's difficult to say where this will fall in Radiohead's already masterful catalog (aside from the fact that it's clearly better than The King of Limbs and Pablo Honey). It's much too early to say this is their defining work, but the first several listens give me hope that it just might be.\n\nOf course, not everyone will like this. This is art for people who demand more out of music. If you haven't really enjoyed Radiohead since The Bends or OK Computer, you will probably find this quite challenging. But if you appreciate music, this will be one of the best things you've heard in a long time. So sit back and drown yourself in this moon shaped pool,","classification":5,"fold":2}

The music here is solid as well and several songs are worth adding to my regular rotation in the car - I'll Take This House, I Go Back To You, and While I Was Away are outstanding. The duets on this album aren't the best or collaborative works Pat Green has done. In particular, Girls From Texas with Lyle Lovett is a mess for me.

It's hard to go back to sleep hearing or seeing the same dream, and yet after this second time I heard it, followed same routine of wiping sweat off and going back to bed...A THIRD TIME...SAME SONG & HOOK!

{"text":"When it has came down to Cee-Lo, he has had some ups and downs as a singer. On his own or with Goodie Mob, he just hasn't been able to hit more of a mainstream shadow. Unlike his work with Gnarls Barkley, when he did Crazy and Smiley Faces, he was able not just to deliver a strong groove into his song, but he hit the big time as a recognizable act. The songs were good, but he hasn't had anything were he was able to makr his own mark after Gnarls Barkley called it a day. But that really changed with F*** You from his solo album The Lady Killer. The song actually brings in a nice take on a old school kind of soul. I really was surprised with the song. It really sounds good, and it is a better than most of the junk right now on radio from Rihanna and many other joke acts. I wonder what he is going to pull out of his next hat, and hopefully it can be stronger than a rabbit.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I first listened to a Willie Nelson duet album 25 years ago when he teamed up with Leon Russell to give us One For The Road. This collaboration with Merle Haggard is almost as good as that album. (I say almost because One For The Road is one of my favorite country albums of all time. It's a high bar.)\n\nHaggard's voice is starting to sound a little older. He's not in his prime, but he's still got a great voice for country music. Nelson is clearly getting older too but somehow he sounds better the older and raspier he gets. Willie Nelson could sit there with a guitar and softly sing the text of the US tax code and it would sound like a tender song that you couldn't turn off. The man's voice is pure gold.\n\nThese two can do the slow songs. They can do the fun up beat songs.\n\n\"Unfairweather Friend\" is one of the best, most touching, wonderful songs I've ever heard in my life. If you don't listen to anything else from this album, listen to this song. Then call your best friend and share it with them.\n\nIf you like REAL country music, this album is a must.

{"text":"The Left Banke is one of those bands from the 60s that kinda fell through the cracks as the years went on.  Pretty much looked at as a \"two hit wonder\", they were much more than that(as One and Two Hit Wonders tend to be sometimes).\nThey're classified as \"Baroque Rock\".  What the hell is that, you ask?  Oddly, it sounds exactly like it's description.  The band members of The Left Banke weren't the most technically savvy of musicians, so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member, Michael Brown.  Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord, both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke's sound.  Add to that, the smooth Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, and you have.....Baroque Rock!!  One song, Evening Gown, almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song!\nI'm surprised I like this album as much as I do.  Though I'm big on vintage rock music, this seemed a little too different than what I normally listen to, which is rockabilly and surf. I initially bought it because I've always had a soft spot for Pretty Ballerina, but much to my surprise I found this whole album to be great!\nI am very glad I picked this one up!  If you like the late 60s stuff, The Left Banke deserves a resurrection.  If you like Justin Bieber, you're a schmuck!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Lil Waynes and his fans expectation of this album is suppose to be a classic in Waynes and the fans eyes, but that is simply not the case. The album however is probably one of the best Hip Hop albums of the year but most definetly NOT one of the best Hip Hop albums of all time.\n\nLil Wayne put his baby picture to somewhat reflect classic albums with the same concept of having the a baby picture as the album cover like Nas's (ILLMATIC) and Notorious B.I.G.'s (READY TO DIE) but however I have a feeling that this album will not have the same impact (sarcasm). I do respect Lil Wayne as a rapper but he is way to arrogant calling himself the Best Rapper Alive when there are better rappers out there with a lot more substance like Nas, Lupe Fiasco, Little Brother, Common, Talib Kweli etc. But there is a reason why he is more populer than those rappers, and that is because he is more mainstream then those. I will say he is the Best MAINSTREAM Rapper Alive but not the best overall in the game. The album features some pretty good production by a wide variety of producers from Kanye West to Cool & Dre to Play-N-Skillz, the production is diverse and is a lot more creative than other Hip Hop albums, rather impressive. Lil Waynes flow in his freestyles are similar in this album, as a matter of fact there is pretty much no difference from his freestyles, on most of his songs on this album (besides a few exceptions) he is pretty much freestyling. Wayne is known for his metaphors and he is probably the best in the business, he is very clever in his rhymes and there is no doubt he is good at that.\n\nFavorite Tracks\n\n3 Peat - good production and a very appropriate title and intro to the album.\n\nMr. Carter - My personal favorite of the album, Wayne and Jay-Z make an unstoppable combo.\n\nA Milli - this is a street banger, this sounds like it came from one of Lil Waynes mixtapes. The beat is an aquired taste but Waynes verses are catchy.\n\nGot Money - Wayne using the auto-vocader and coincidently he features the person who is most famous for using it. \"T-Pain\". The song doesn't have substance but it is a club song so I guess its OK.\n\nComfortable - the song seems a bit out of place but the Kanye production is sick and Babyface brings an appreciated taste to the song.\n\nTie My Hands - this is one of my favorites and I think it is the deepest I have ever heard from Wayne. Robin Thicke sounds cool and very appropriate for the song. Wayne talks about Hurricane Katrina and other tragedies. THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM\n\nLet The Beat Build - another Kanye production and it sounds exactly what the title implies. The Beat just keeps on building while Wayne keeps on spittin'.\n\nLollipop - everybody shood know this song, no need to explain.\n\nThe album may not be a clssic like some say it is but it is a decent album, and in my opinion it is worth a buy. If you get the deluxe edition it comes with a bonus disc including the 5 songs that was released as an EP as \"The Leak\" and in my opinion those 5 songs prove that Wayne is one of the best, not the songs that is on the main album unfortunately.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"This album is OUTSTANDING.  Why in the hell are we not hearing more about these guys???!!!!  Terry Kath Chicago fans UNITE!  CTA is the REAL deal, and the new songs fit well and show this group has fantastic potential. With all the hubbub about the latest release of Chicago's \"lost\" Stone of Sisyphus, I think I'm going to puke.  The reviews for SOS all sound like old fans trying to convince themselves that SOS is the best since the Terry Kath days and that they should be excited and happy.  It might be best, but it is still a gigantic cry from that early magic. Chicago since Terry Kath's passing and even the \"transitional\" Hot Streets album is a completely different band and should have changed their name.  All the blues and grit from the early days has continued to be replaced with slick production, synthesizers, and seriously stripped down guitar.  California Transit Authority DOES have that early magic, and I hope and pray they can continue to create and perform.  The WORD must get out. And before you get the idea these guys are just an old Chicago cover band, forget it!  They add their own spice and the new songs show they are every bit as inovative and appealing.  Be prepared to be blown away.\n\nIt is truly tragic that Pankow, Loughnane, Parazaider, and Lamm are not a part of Danny's new adventure. The songs are polished, the sound is GREAT, and, if they are honest with themselves, as musicians (with any personality conflicts set aside), I would imagine they would be crying inside not having been part of this wonderful project.\n\nWhen I first heard that the brass sound on the tracks was done on keyboard, I thought it would sound nothing but cheesy.  NO WAY.  No way at all.  In fact, when I listen to the tracks, I cannot tell the difference except on 25 or 6 to 4 which, I believe, was done live.  I can easily imagine that Pankow, Loughnane, and Parazaider made the studio sessions in secret, but due to contractual obligations, they are not credited. Wouldn't that be a gas?!  Anyway, time will tell if the band can pull off some new tunes that equal or surpass Pankow's inovative big brass sound.\n\nThe new musicans really, really cook!!!  Marc Bonilla is fantastic find.  Though no one can replace Kath, Bonilla has his own magic and the playing is phenomenal. He definitely HAS the down and dirty blues.  Larry Braggs from Tower of Power is a perfect fit for the group. All the other musicans are just great, and they play tight.\n\nOne more comment.  I already knew that Danny was a rock drum genius, but this album makes it painfully clear he was an extremely essential ingredient to the early Chicago sound.\n\nIf you like the Terry Kath Chicago, this is an absolute must buy.  RIGHT NOW!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I could go on in depth for a really lengthy review, but let me just quickly relay that this is an album that must be listened to.  Ryan Adams is an artist I had heard before, but never considered myself a fan or non-fan.  His interpretation of the songs from Taylor Swift's 1989 album are truly astonishing.  In particular, his rendering of Out of the Woods shows not just his chops as a professional musician, but his gifts as an artist who could see into the lyrics of Swift's original and re-imagine them.  The result on that song as with all the others is actually quite remarkable.  I think it speaks not only to Adams' abilities, but also speaks to the depths of Swift's music which to most of us just sounds like \"fun pop music\".","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I too miss the Captain America theme that was established for the first movie, but I have to agree with others that these are two different films.  The first Captain America film music was heroic and somewhat majestic in sound.  It fit the age in which movie was set in.  It was that \"Story Book\" view of the last great war that the music captured so well.  This is a gritty, dark, and muscled soundtrack that places Captain America into a modern landscape in which he is still trying to adjust.  The score has moments of solemn thoughtfulness in which he deals with the issues that surround him and then it explodes into percussive electronic bliss while he fights the bad guys.  I listened to the soundtrack first and just recently saw the movie.  There is a ton of hand to hand combat in this movie.  Flips, kicks, throwing, dodging, etc.  Captain America doesn't have laser beams and hammers that allow him to fly through the air.  He can't pick up a mountain and he doesn't spin any webs.  He is a hand to hand combat guy and the music makes every punch and acrobatic move all the better.  I think this is why we find a lot of similar music like this in other movies in which their heroes do many of the same thing.  Batman, 300, and martial arts movies incorporate this same technique and style in many of their films as well.  I like the \"electronic noise\" of this music and when watching\/listening to how this is used in the movie...you can understand the composers choices and to me it becomes justified musically.  There are some interesting effects in the music.  I particularly like when the music sounds as if you are listening with your ears covered.  It's almost like you've been next to an explosion and have lost your hearing for a few moments.  It provides a wonderful psychological device within the scene and helps to increase the tension greatly.  The music isn't all bombs and pops either.  There are a few cues that introduce us to \"mystery\" element that develops in the movie.  The track \"Hydra\" is a quiet almost haunting number that gives almost a Sherlock Holmes feel to it as the characters investigate and learn more about this organization.  The score has it all really.  You've got your heroic \"I am Captain America\" tracks, the pulse pounding combat music, the \"out of place out of time\" sad music, and the murder mystery \"I can't believe this is happening\" stuff.  I think he blends together nicely and really adds some variety to the score as a whole.  I recommend the score.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I've been a supporter of Trey Songz since his first album release eight years ago. While Trey does get a bad rep from most, I actually think he's one of the strongest singers in the under thirty field of R&B. On his fifth release, Trey makes a so-so album and I can think he only did it as he feels that he's made it and there's no need to make quality music anymore. However the album is nowhere near the failure that it could've been. The singles from the album Dive In, Heart Attack, 2 Reasons feat. T.I., Fumble and Simply Amazing are all worthy additions to Trey's catalog. Songz excels the most for me on Without A Woman. While Trey may never top his READY album, with his fifth album, Songz shows he's here to stay.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Musically, \"Dead Again\" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.\n\nThere are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational\/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (\"I'm a drug addict, always will be\", \"there's no excuse for drug abuse\", \"A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide\") or pun-filled attempts at humor (\"Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four\").  The song \"Ode to Locksmiths\" actually has the line \"Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped\".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as \"September Sun\" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, \"She Burned Me Down\" and \"Halloween in Heaven\".\n\nOther than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque \"These Three Things\" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (\"Black No. 1\") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Profits of Doom\", \"These Three Things\", \"Ode to Locksmiths\" and the haunting closer \"All Hail and Farewell to Britain\" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend \"Dead Again\" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics.","classification":4,"fold":2}

I simply don't get it. Mary has been selling millions of albums across the world for 16 years now and that could explain why, to these ears, she's beginning to sound a bit weary. She's been telling us all how she's incredibly happy now, how her life is exactly where she wants it to be and how, whilst going through all the pain in her recent past, one thing she's always strived to do is keep things real with her fans. This might all well be true but I'm yet to see Mary actually LOOKING happy in an interview or a video. (Jill Scott always looks happy for instance, even these days - and she's just been through a divorce!).\n\nBut maybe that's just Mary's way. Maybe it's the 'street' or 'ghetto fabulous' thing to; to never smile even if feeling blissful. Her continuous banging on about said bliss is starting to grate on the nerves a tad though. She's a strong woman, no doubt, and a trooper. She does \"keep on going\", as one reviewer said but at what cost? Like I said, the poor woman is probably just really tired.\n\nWhen she burst onto the scene back in 1992 with songs like \"Real Love\", \"Reminisce\" and \"Love No Limit\", she showed energy, versatility and raw emotion that have long since dissipated. The bittersweet \"Be Happy\" and the poignant \"I'm Goin' Down from her sophomore album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Life\/dp\/B000002OU8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Life<\/a>&nbsp;proved she was no one-hit wonder. And let's not forget her star turns on hip-hop classics like \"Can't Knock The Hustle\" with Jay-Z (1996) and \"I'll Be There For You\/You're All I Need To Get By\" with Method Man (1995). I for one thought the title \"Queen of Hip-Hop Soul\" was absolutely well deserved.\n\nBut every subsequent album has been less satisfying, and more geared towards what was playing on the radio than the one that preceded it. By the time \"The Breakthrough\" came out, I was starting to lose interest. It was clear to any objective listener that Mary was just treading water and I've barely played the CD three times since I got it. This one I simply couldn't bear and had to take right back to the store and ask for something else.\n\nAs soon as I saw the video to her single \"Just Fine\", I had my doubts. The Michael Jackson homage-paying intro (and the video itself) was probably well intentioned but to me, they just fell flat. It just doesn't sound or look like she really means it. She's singing about being uplifted but she sounds (and looks) anything but. Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" but to me, Mary looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. It's not so much in her moves, it's in her eyes and her facial expressions.\n\nThe female empowerment of \"Grown Woman\" and \"Feel Like A Woman\" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah's studio audience but this listener just couldn't find the groove - and I'm no chauvinist. It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I've grooved to in my time.\n\nPharrell's multi-tempoed \"'Til The Morning\" and Ne-Yo's interestingly winding \"Smoke\" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made-for-radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she's ever sung - much more control, much less excess - but somehow for me, that just makes her less interesting to listen to. A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn \"Fade Away\". Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days, Mary sounds like she's barely breaking a sweat.\n\nMaybe that's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone. Or maybe, just maybe, as listeners, we've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result, anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing. Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days, is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be. I realise that we're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it's entirely possible that Mary's heart isn't really in the music she's putting out, despite all her talk of the contrary. Whatever. In the end, we'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand.\n\nMaybe Mary's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is. All I know is that while it must be a good thing (especially for her) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone, her supposedly newly-found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet. To me, singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to.\n\nThe album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards, so I know my view is the minority one. I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here but I had to say my piece. I didn't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine (who will remain nameless) encouraged me to do so, so here it is. Let the hissing, booing and clicking on the \"no\" button begin.","classification":3,"fold":2}

Gene Simmons (KISS) was recently quoted as saying \"Rock is dead.\" I have to admit that agree, but not entirely.\nI have waited for the release of this album since hearing of its making many months ago and the anticipation was well worth it. Going back to the roots of early Led Zeppelin with a sort of Delta Blues influence, Robert Plant has embraced those same roots and produced something almost magical. I no longer look to hear the attempts to replicate the hard hitting Led Zeppelin sound from him or Jimmy Page or John Paul Jones but rather look to hear something different and fresh. This album has everything I would hope for. Let's all face it, Led Zeppelin is and was the greatest rock band of all time and no one will ever measure up to that uniqueness.\nlullaby... may not be what every Led Zeppelin fan would hope for but it is the music loved by Plant. For myself, and I'm sure everyone who appreciates his musical genius, it is without doubt, another to add to the \"must have\" collection.\nIf you are looking for the heavy Zep sounds, this may not be for you.

{"text":"A beautiful restoration with stunning bonus tracks of the strangely overlooked Peggy Lee masterpiece from 1974 capture the fascinating legendary lady in peak form, mesmerizing title song produced and arranged by Paul McCartney.  Fresh from a dramatic weight loss and looking like a million bucks, Peggy Lee was ready to go when she signed Atlantic Records to record a soulful set of great contemporary songs.  Peggy Lee went deep inside, laid down a stunning vocal on the great \"Let's Love\" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release. Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester's \"He Is The One\" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal.  Sensuous and funky on a playful \"Easy Evil\", torchy and illuminating \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\", clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired!  A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen \"Always\" a delight while \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\" becomes a tour-de-force, making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic. Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual \"Sweet Lov'liness\" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original \"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\" is simply gorgeous.  Soulful seduction make \"Sweet Talk\" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini \"Sometimes\" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own.  Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with \"I Am His Lady\" the best ever version of this soft-jazz treat.  A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original \"I Wanna Be Seduced\" great fun and another Peggy original \"The Nickel Ride\" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting.  This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos  Grammy Winner \"Is That All There Is?\". Peggy must have wondered \"Is That All There Is?\" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference, robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved. Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring \"Let's Keep Dancing\" which was to be Peggy's last major studio production and a winner it is!  This great song featured in \"Sharky's Machine\" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties!.  Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70's \"Where Did They Go\" and the classic \"Norma Delores Egstrom\", both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form, fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70's work.  For those who enjoy great singers in a sublime setting in peak form, do not miss this classic collection, this level of greatness will never happen again...special Limited Numbered Edition & value will soar when no longer available...Thank You Peggy Lee for years of great entertainment and sublime vocals & classy lady RIP","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"You find out that life is just a game of inches\" said Al Pacino in a memorable speech in the film \"Any Given Sunday\". Scott Hutchinson the vocal and song writing driving force of Scotland's finest Frightened Rabbit would recognise the sentiment. The Frabbit's career has been a stately slow burn particularly in the UK. Their debut the \"Midnight Organ Fight\" remains one of the most precious break up albums ever, but its predecessor 2010's \"The Winter of Mixed Drinks\" didn't really stamp its full authority, languished in the play offs and the band still await promotion to the premier division.\n\n\"Pedestrian Verse\" is their fourth album and as the \"fingers crossed review\" in the Independent smartly puts it \"here's hoping they can also Elbow their way into the mainstream\" (Boom boom!). The chances of this are very good as \"Pedestrian Verse\" is an album which shows that Hutchinson's ability to combine soaring passion with often bleak musical lyricism and mix it into powerhouse songs has increased exponentially. Just listen to the brilliant lead single \"The Woodpile\" a mix of massive swirling guitars and a chorus so huge it obscures the sun, as Hutchinson pleads \"Will you come back to my corner?\/Spent too long alone tonight\/Would you come and Brighten my corner\/A Lit torch to the woodpile eye\". Do yourself a favour also check out the \"supermarket incident\" video that goes with this. The album's opener \"Acts of man\" again is a big anthem but underpinned by almost Roger Waters like cynicism. Thus the observation that \"I see the stumbling pinstriped trouser\/Flecks of sick on and off his shoe\/Part out the fatty British average\/Who lives in the houses around you\" is actually one of the kinder lines. These are songs for Broken Britain not least \"State Hospital\". It starts slowly with a simple set of chords, big drums pounding in the background and Scott Hutchison's uniquely brilliant Selkirk infused voice full of equal parts heart and muscular ache. It is song of poverty, domestic abuse and set around the birth of a probably unwanted baby. As Hutchinson passionately sings the chorus \"Her heart beats like a breeze block thrown down the stairs\/Her blood is thicker than concrete forced to be brave she was, born into a grave\" you smile broadly knowing that they are back to their very best.\n\n\"Pedestrian Verse\" is a muscular album full of songs that grab you in an instance and in a vice like grip refuse to let go. Clearly spreading the responsibility of the songwriting duites across the band has assisted this proving that a dose of democracy yields benefits. The surging \"Late March, Death March\" is a real standout, while the short and punchy separated songs of \"Housing (In)' and \"Housing (out)\" work well. In \"December Traditions\" shows that the bands sojourn recording the album in the wonders of the Welsh countryside has somehow tightened them and achieved a level of focus which has sometimes been absent. It sweeps along with a great lyric and ends with the full gamut of the bands voices. For those Frabbits fans that like the bands more distinctively Scottish side the deluxe edition is a must with three extra songs. The gentle acoustics of the stunning \"If you were me\" harks back to the Midnight Organ Fight and is a song of shattering heartbreak; \"Snow still melting\" is a pounding rock song with a great melody and finally \"Escape Route\" ends the album with a bang; an intoxicating mix of acoustics and high drama. On the evidence of \"Pedestrian Verse\" Frightened Rabbit deserve to be garlanded with praise for this feisty and always emotionally-charged set of songs. It shows a band reaching their peak and like the Scottish Munro's they touch altitudes that many of their counterparts will never summit.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Like a folksier Miranda Lambert, Sarah Jarosz connects to the pit of me with `Run Away'; a soft yet piercing folk ballad.  With country, blue-grass roots that sink deep into her musical persona, Jarosz uses her stunning voice to create a beautiful and haunting track here.  The lyrical content isn't very original (there and plenty of songs, especially in the Country genre, that cover this brand of material) but she sells it with every word.  For those of you iffy about the association with Blue Grass, know that this is a very modern and accessible take on the genre, one that many can and will soak up with delight.  She underscores the finger plucking guitar strings with a crystal clear voice that pierces through and builds an emotional response; and the choice to slow down the commonly high-energy variants of the song make for a nice change of pace.  AND THOSE HARMONIES ARE PHENOMENAL!  Take my word for it; you'll love it!\n\nI can't wait to hear more from her.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"RnB\/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, \"Voyage To India\", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.\nIndia Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called \"Growth\" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely true. The second track is an mid-tempo song called \"Little Things\". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a \"call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday\". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes \"Talk To Her\", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and \"talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama\". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (\"It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit\"), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.\nAfterwards comes the mid-tempo \"Slow Down\", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic \"The Truth\", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, \"Beautiful Surprise\", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, \"Healing\" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.\nSubsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, \"Get It Together\" and \"Headed in The Right Direction\". \"Get It Together\" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. \"Headed In The Right Direction\" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes \"Can I Walk With You\" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes \"The One\", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.\nNext comes \"Complicated Melody\" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, \"Gratitude\" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, \"Good Man\", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, \"God Is Real\" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track \"Interested\" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.\nOverall Mark: 3\/5\nAlthough this is still a great album, \"Voyage To India\" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable.","classification":3,"fold":2}

China Cat->Rider is it's usual 1973 self which is fantastic. the set is rounded out with Big River, Brown-Eyed Women and Around And Around. The second set starts off with cool versions of Row Jimmy, Jack Straw and Ramble On Rose. The linchpin of this show is one of only three versions of Playing In The Band->Uncle John's Band->Morning Dew->Uncle John's Band->Playing In The Band which is played to the hilt. Stella Blue is pretty and El Paso was always better in the 1970s.

But while his music stands the test of time over the years, some of the songs released after his death haven't been as strong on the American V or the American VI records. That is absolutely the case with American VI's title track Ain't No Grave. The song isn't really a strong song, as was the case with his prior American series songs, like his cover of Nine Inch Nails song Hurt. All in all, it is a real treat for the hard core Johnny Cash fan, but honestly not what would've been his strongest song from the series.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"This group was scheduled to play at the New Orleans Jazz Fest 11 days ago and the name vaguely sounded familiar. I looked them up on my list of concerts attended, and sure enough they opened up for Mary Chapin Carpenter back in October of 1995. We walked out on Mary back then, but actually enjoyed The Mavericks better. However, at that time I did not like them enough to buy any of their CD's. So I checked sound clips and reviews on this one. I read many complaints that this was not country music, and you know what? This is absolutely right, which is why I like this one so much. I would classify it as Roots Rock in the similar vein as Los Lobos, with strong elements of Tejano and Roy Orbison. Thankfully, someone like Raul Malo of this group is keeping the style of Roy Oribison's singing still going, almost like boleros. Well, even after listening to sound clips and reading reviews, all that did was get me to add them to my list of acts to see at Jazz Fest. Needless to say, they blew my socks off and stunned many of the fans waiting to see headliner Willie Nelson. No, this is not country music, but it sure as heck gets into my bones and makes this listener's heart jump for joy. If they come to a city near you to play, by all means catch them if you call yourself a serious music fan. I also bought their Definitive Collection from Amazon, and I like this new release even a tad better than that one. Good music!!!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"As a long as I can remember, Weezer has been one of my all time favorite bands from my youth. When they finally came back from their long hiatus with their self title in 2001 they have been cranking out new music by the boat loads. Unfortunatly while there have been hits like 'Keep Fishin', 'Pork and Beans' and 'Memories', their albums as a whole have been hit or miss at best. Their previous album really made me feel that they were coming back to their classic ways with a very strong album in 'Everything Will Be Alright in the End' Their new self-titled 'White Album' is a long miss from that level. The songs are not memorable and the album just does not resonate.\n\nI feel that like some of my other favorite bands this is another that I am just going to give up on when it comes to future releases. I feel that Weezer has left their mark on music but, there is no reason to stick around knowing that your band will not be forgotten.

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Ok I'm not going to give a rant about who Robert Plant is and how he was the Rock God singer of Led Zeppelin, even though I love the bands music.  I honestly never really paid attention to Robert Plants solo career until now.  I heard about his Album of the Year winner collaboration \"Raising Sand\" and I gave it a listen and never really loved it.  When I buy CDs nowadays I savor the money for music that is worth a purchase.  This album came out the same week another release I was looking forward to came out.  It was Interpols 2014 album.  But then I saw this album being advertised and I looked up the first single \"Rainbow\" and was blown away.  It had Zeppelin and African influences.  I love music that is influenced by the world.  So I bought this the day it came out over the Interpol album.  I still might get that one another time.  Never too late.  But this was my winner for now.  Little did I know what I was getting into.  Like most people, I was expecting an entire album of catchy world songs all similar to \"Rainbow\".  My first listen left me somewhat disappointed.  This is an 11 track album and I felt like something was missing at first.  I almost dismissed it as a waste of money before realizing that I needed to give it a chance to really sink in.  And I did.  And it did!  Though there are obvious LZ moments especially Plants voice, this was actually one of the most original and mesmerizing albums I've heard in a while.  Here is my track by track review!\n\n1.  Little Maggie:  This one took me a while to get into.  It's very Celtic.  A modern remake of a classic folk song.  I expected worldly music, but when I heard it, I guess I hadn't adjusted to it yet.  The instruments, including a banjo riff, are all very pumping.  It's the type of song you could expect to hear at some World festival.  Plants vocals are of course very LZ but at the same time they aren't, which is good.  I love how this song builds up.  Not my favorite but I can appreciate the artistry of it!  8.5\/10\n2.  Rainbow:  The lead single.  I really believed this could've been a big hit if promoted right.  As stated above, I love the LZ influenced guitars with the African drums!  The vocals of course are very uplifting as are the lyrics.  The \"wooooooooo oooooo\" parts are impossible not to feel deep in your soul!  I just want to accomplish something while listening to this song.  Something amazing. 10\/10\n3.  Pocketful of Golden:  Another song that took a few listens to sink in.  This song really becomes a jam once you get into it.  The subtle elements within the song you could miss if you don't listen close.  There is a bit of a middle eastern influence to this song but the beat and groove altogether make it very cool.  Just cool!  The chorus is very LZ sounding of course.  This is world music done right!  9\/10\n4.  Embrace Another Fall:  This is a candidate for the best song on the album for me so far.  That could change though.  Again, at first I didn't care much for this one.  Then I put the album on shuffle and this one came up. The vocals bring to memory Plants old band again of course, but the way his vocals compliment the instruments in this one is amazing.  This is gorgeous and just plain masterful.  There is even a nice guitar part halfway through.  Then there is a haunting vocal toward the end.  But I just have to compliment the musicianship on this one the most so far!  Listen for yourself.  Listen many times so it can sink in deep.  This song always brings to mind imagery of traveling around like in a blockbuster action film that takes the character to a foreign country!  Just great.  10\/10\n5.  Turn It Up:.  I immediately was going to dismiss this song just because of its title.  I thought it wasn't \"Robert Plant\" to have a title like this.  I assumed it was a song that would try too hard to sound cool for parties or something.  I love party music and such, but I didn't want that type of song on this type of album.  Luckily I was WRONG.  This is a pure rocker.  Yes, it does try to sound cool, but it also succeeds.  This is one of the songs that resembles the LZ more than it wants to.  Less world music influence, but still different enough to set itself apart from LZ again. The guitar riff is gonna be covered a lot.  9\/10\n6.  A Stolen Kiss:  I expected a lot from this song.  Its the ballad.  Plants voice really does ballads well.  Its very beautiful and heartbreaking.  Very calm and relaxing after the mostly pumping vibe of the first half of the album.  This is one you have to listen to with a great sound system so you can appreciate every aspect of it.  The piano toward the last half was a nice touch.  I just wish Plant sang more toward the end.  Still a great ballad to relax you and prepare you for the second half.  10\/10\n7.  Somebody There:  This is the song that sounds most like the legendary band.  Seriously.  The guitars, the drums, the vocals, especially the chorus.  I feel like this could also be a good single if released.  Definitely the most catchy and radio friendly song alongside 'Rainbow'.  I think this is a great homage to himself from the past while also a step forward.  10\/10\n8.  Poor Howard:  Very catchy right away.  Some might find it annoying the way Plant repeats \"Ohhh Howard Pooor boy\" but I like it.  The banjo is also impossible not to want to jam to.  Very worldly and folky and even dance-worthy for a festival.  I'm not great with instruments but there is a really gorgeous and fast violin sounding stringed instrument around 2 minutes in and near the end that I really love.  Great song.  9.5\/10\n9.  House of Love:  Another slower but still upbeat relaxing song.  This song just glides by elegantly.  I feel like I'm flying over mountains at a slow rate when listening to this one.  Plants vocals again are perfect.  He sings it just right.  There's almost a playful feel to the background instruments.  The ending really brings it all to a great ending.  9.5\/10\n10.  Up on the Hollow Hillside (Understanding Arthur):  This is another 'cool' song.  The song has great guitars to mix with Plants vocals to give it this very legendary feel.  The drums are back to world music and sometimes sounding a bit industrial.  There is also a slight electronic element that is subtle.  This song is the definition of cool rock music.  Something perfect for an exotic action movie soundtrack.  10\/10\n11.  Arbaden(Maggies Babby):  So far this is my least favorite song.  The beginning starts off where the intro track ended and is also another remake of it.  The instruments and Plants intelligible parts are great.  But I just cant get into the otherworldly chants that take place throughout the song. Great musicianship, but the 'arbaden' chants really kill it for me.  I'm glad this is the shortest song.  Others may love it, but for now I just put up with it.  Leaves me wanting more, not more of the song, but more of the other songs.  7\/10\n\nSo this is definitely an album that takes getting used to for most.  Many will even love it right away, but I think the best albums are the ones that you don't like at first but suddenly love after repeated listens.  This is a masterpiece.  Experimental without sounding too experimental.  Accessible enough to get you to come back for more until you finally wonder why you didn't like it in the first place.  Very original.  I haven't heard such great combinations of world music done this good before.  This album really latches onto you once you let it.  Robert Plant has really set himself apart from his old band while at the same time paying homage to them in some moments that work well.  A lot of these songs really do sound perfect for exotic foreign country scenes in blockbuster movies!  I strongly believe this could be a candidate for Album of the Year.  At least a nomination!  Great album to just vibe to!  Highly recommended.  Just remember to give it multiple good listens before you form a full opinion!  If you like good music that is different but great, then you'll be able to love this!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Deep Purple return after a very long absence of new music with their amazing new album called Now What?! which shows why they are considered to be one of the best rock bands of all time regardless of the lineup. Produced by Bob Ezrin from Pink Floyd and Alice Cooper fame, Now What?! is an example of a band firing on all cylinders and working together creatively to produce excellent new music that respects the past while forging a fresh future. The current lineup features Ian Gillan on vocals, Roger Glover on bass, Ian Paice on drums, Steve Morse on guitar, and Don Airey on keyboards and they all perform superbly on this album to create some really exciting songs and musical passages. Highlights include the rocking opener \"Simple Song\", the progressive sounds of \"Weirdestan\", the signature rock vibe of \"Out Of Hand\" featuring some great keyboard sounds, the great groove and guitar playing of \"Bodyline\", the sweet build up and intense crescendo of \"Uncommon Man\", and the very smooth sound of \"All The Time In The World\". Besides being an amazing album of all new material that cements their relevance, Now What?! is appropriately dedicated to Deep Purple's late keyboard player and founding member Jon Lord whose influence on music continues to this day. Now What?! is highly recommended to all Deep Purple fans and anyone who likes good quality hard rock with a progressive twist - a very solid 4.5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Not many songs are such an instant hit with me as this one. As a song on its own it is beautiful and I can imagine hearing it on the radio for years to come. But I must admit, the video really set it in a permanent place for me as it is filmed in Wyoming and Idaho, most of it is on the Togwotee Trail Highway which is a mountain range in the rockies that crosses the Continental Divide just outside of Yellowstone Park. This highway is my home, It is a special place and even inspired Bob Seger to write \"Roll me Away\".\n\nFor me, \"Bonfire Heart\" is a beautiful continuum to \"Roll me Away\" and captures the essence of the soul in travel\/flight. A sense of how much more there is out there and it is nearly overwhelming to realize it. More than a love song, this tune has spirit.\n\n For me James Blunt took up where Bob Seger left off and it is perfect.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"Thunderstruck by AC\/DC is an alluring rock hit that has musically strong guitars and well placed chanting.

{"text":"First off, while this song may have a close structure to a certain U2 song, it wouldn't be the first time a good song sounded like a good song, Boulevard of Broken Dreams-Wonderwall? What about Take Me Out-Paralyzer? The point is, not a big deal.\n\nSo anyways, the song has a nice buildup. It is a little slow, and the payoff may be less than satisfying, but Linkin Park is clearly going for a soft rock sound, to go in some background somewhere. Some people may like the sound, like soft rock fans, but fans of Linkin park will be like, WTH? \"In The End\" this is not. The vocals suit the song, the lyrics are good. Are they trying to go for a love song or something?\n\nOverall, try first, maybe buy if you like. For me, it's just another song on radio I could really care less about. And definitely not one you want to hear all the time. Maybe every once in a while, but that's it.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"I don't like the direction female r and b music is going.  Beyonce, Keysia Cole and now Brandy all put out average cds, with sounds that are overpolished, and geared towards a whitewashed audience.  I would rather listen to old AAliyah, SWV, or Toni Braxton cds than all of this.  Most of the songs on Brandy's cd sound the same, like they were over-thinking the whole project.  The songs are over dramatic and too American idolish for my taste.  I think they are trying to market r and b to a new demographic, people who don't even like r and b.  If you compare Brandy's \"Human\" cd to an album like Chante Moore's \"Precious\", you will understand what I'm talking about.  The romance and the real love is gone.  It's been replaced by synthetic messes like this album.  I guess they've run out of creative juice, and are just feeding music listeners junk food. This is not a traditional r and b album.  I really only like 1 song off the entire cd.  \"Shattered Heart\" is the only song that stands out and has some kind of flow and feeling behind it.  The rest of the songs are like background music, neither good or bad.  They sort of just mesh together like one big glob.  I love all of Brandy's other cds, my faves are her first album and \"Full Moon\".  \"Human\" lacks everything that being \"human\" is all about, ironically which is love, individuality, creativity, passion, spirituality, and about a hundred other adjectives.  Im sure this cd is good to clean your house to just gel out to but like I said before, there are many other female r and b albums that outshine this, and other hit songs that are classic and have stood the test of time.  Can you name one song off here that people will remember years from now and know all the lyrics to, and even do karaoke to?  At least Toni Braxton had \"UnBreak My Heart\", and Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\".  What happened to music like that??","classification":3,"fold":2}

I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.  He needs Young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and Crosby\/Nash to step up his vocals.  I was disappointed with this CD\/DVD and will probably  put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while (maybe).","classification":2,"fold":2}

I was not willing to wait until spring of 2002 for the US release of \"Living Proof\". I was happy to shell out the big bucks for her new album. Needless to say, the results were positive. \"Living Proof\" is ten times better than \"Believe\". The material she chose to record is far better than most of the songs off its predecessor. Although I do think Cher overdoes it on the vocoder sounds on this cd, I was able to forgive her for that since every song on this cd is a winner in my book. I immediately fell in love with \"Alive Again\" which is one of my favorite tracks off this cd. I was completely surprised when I heard Cher cover one of my favorite songs from another dance diva Amber. Cher does a swell job at \"Love One Another\". Unlike \"Believe\", \"Living Proof\" is a stronger dance album. The songs are tight and the material was just right for Cher. I love this album.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"A month and a week later here I am! And it must be known that Taylor Swift's latest effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Red\/dp\/B008XNZMOU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Red<\/a>&nbsp;is pretty damn good. At first I was pretty underwhelmed with some of the first couple of tracks on the first listen. However, there were still standouts. And I didn't give up. After a couple of listens I grew to like all of the songs (except for one) to varying degrees. That song with Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol (\"The Last Time\") is the only track that isn't that great to listen to. It feels lifeless and on iTunes it's the only track here that is rated as low as a 3\/5. The duet with Ed Sheeran (\"Everything Has Changed\") fares so much better. Some of my favorites on the album are \"Begin Again\", \"Starlight\", \"I Knew Your Were Trouble\", \"22\", \"All Too Well\", \"Holy Ground\", \"Everything Has Changed\" and the cute and light \"Stay Stay Stay\" to name a few. That's half the album!\n\nLike I said a bunch of the tracks had to grow on me and there is a few tracks that could have been even stronger but this is still a winner. I love the album's diversity and only wish that there were a couple more country pop tunes to fill the album roster. \"Begin Again\" was the only song that had obvious country twang to it that I could tell. \"Red\" has a light banjo throughout but can only be heard strongly at the very end. I know the serious lack of country-ness has angered a lot of her fans. But I guess if you aren't on this journey with Swift you can find another artist you enjoy instead. After this release it's really tough to figure out where she is headed but I'm eagerly awaiting her next CD of tunes already. For now,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Red\/dp\/B008XNZMOU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Red<\/a>'ll do. Lastly, I'd like to say the deluxe probably isn't worth it. In my opinion, the 3 new tracks that I heard sounded like bland leftovers that should have not made the album at all! I didn't hear the demo versions of the standard albums songs though...\n\nThis album covers genres of pop, pop rock, dub step and just a little bit of country pop (sorry, Swifties!).\n\n4.5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"First Aid Kit, consisting of two sisters from Sweden, Johanna and Klara Sderberg, blew onto the folk-pop-americana scene with their outstanding debut album The Big Black & the Blue from 2010 (which was preceded by a maxi-EP in 2009). Incredibly, the sisters were only 16 and 20 at that time. I was introduced to that album by my daughter and absolutely loved that album. I couldn't get into the follow-up album Lions Roar in 2012 quite as much. Meanwhile the band continued rising upwards in the ranks of the folk-pop genre due to extensive touring. Now comes the duos new studio album. If you are unfamiliar with their sound, imagine if Fleet Foxes were women, and from Sweden.\n\nStay Gold (10 tracks; 38 min.) opens with a joyful and gently rollicking My Silver Lining, with lush strings but not so much as too overshadow the sisters. Master Pretender is an equally sunny track, even if the lyrics suggest not quite that same disposition: Oh, I'm a master pretender\/I always knew that I was young\/But with a head held high and a shotgun\/I could fool almost anyone, wow! Stay Gold is a showcase of the sisters beautiful voices. Shattered & Hollow is the type of song that makes the comparison to Fleet Foxes so obvious. I love this song! Side B kicks off with The Bell, and here again there is a lot of orchestration to accompany the sisters. Waitress Song is another great story teller song (I could move to a small town\/ And become a waitress\/Say my name was Stacy\/And I was figuring things out\/See, my baby, he left me\/And I don't feel like staying here tonight). By now we are deep into the album, and the exuberance felt in the early tracks has now given way to much more introspection, check out the haunting Fleeting One, and later on the album closer A Long Time Ago. But in between those two is a great Heaven Knows, which reminds of Mumford And Sons.\n\nIn all, this is a fantastic little album. Nothing revolutionary here. Just plain ol great folk-pop music, with the angelic voices from Johanna and Klara. I like this album better than Lions Roar, but that is obviously just my own subjective view. I encourage you to check out the new album and draw your own conclusions. And heres hoping I will finally get an opportunity to see First Aid Kit in concert sometime soon (knock on wood)! Meanwhile, Stay Gold is HIGHLY RECOMEMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Here we have a terrific collection of the most popular music from Tchaikovsky, plus some that is less well known. The highlights are the symphonies and the violin concerto. The performances and recordings are generally very good to excellent.\n\nThe Violin Concerto is given a tour de force interpretation by Israeli violinist Vadim Glutzman, with British conductor Andrew Litton conducting the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. This is a concerto that deserves the Tchaikovsky's erratic passionate nature to be transmitted from both the soloist and the orchestra. Here the first movement by itself leaves you exhausted from the drama that this combination is able to create. It is a delightful respite when Glutzman is able to convey the lyrical beauty of the slow movement (which also has its passionate moments). The third movement starts as it means to go on, passionate momentum and fireworks from the violinist, but also tender and beautiful playing from the winds in the orchestra. As with most of the pieces in this collection the recording is second to none, with great sharpness of detail and undistorted climaxes.\n\nGlutzman also gives us a piece that was new to me: \"Souvenir d'un lieu cher\" a poignant and playful memory of a \"place that is dear to one's heart\", once again played with the Bergen and Litton combination. This is reminiscent of Elgar's violin pieces from the same period, fairly light and romantic, played by Glutzman without schmalz but with occasional bravura.\n\nThis collection includes most of Neeme Jarvi's set of the major Tchaikovsky symphonies (not the Manfred, that is played by the Moscow Radio Orchestra under Gennadi Rozhdestvensky) in his acclaimed series with the Gothenberg Symphony Orchestra&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tchaikovsky-The-Symphonies-and-Orchestral-Works\/dp\/B004OTY1EO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tchaikovsky: The Symphonies and Orchestral Works<\/a>&nbsp;along with some of the  shorter orchestral works from this collection ( Cappricio Italien, Voyevoda (2 pieces) , Romeo and Juliet, Francesca de Rimini,Eugene Onegin (2), Festive Overture). The recordings are superb, as are the performances, with pin point recording of the instruments and a broad spread and acoustic.\n\nThe Bamberg Symphony Orchestra under Jose Serebrier gives us the Marche Slave, The Tempest and the \"1812\". Pretty standard Tchaikovsky fare played well but unmemorably. The same orchestra, this time under Leif Sagerstam provide support to Roland Pntinen in a lively and well played performance of the famous Piano Concerto no. 1.\n\nI didn't know the Trio for Cello, Violin and Piano and enjoyed this spirited performance by the Trio Amati. Once again this is performed with great passion and virtuosity, at times a little exhaustingly. This is a surprisingly long piece for a piano trio, just over 48 minutes. At one time this would have filled an LP record and now its a kind of filler on a 14 hour compilation!\n\nThe cello also takes centre stage for the \"Roccoco Variations\", played by Victor Simon with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra under Vladimir Fedoseyev. Simon was principle cellist with the orchestra, which, I understand, is now known as the \"Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra\". The orchestra tours under this name and this recording was released under this and in Simon's honour, just before his 70th birthday in the year 2000. The Variations are nicely played with excellent support from the orchestra - it's not quite Rostrapovich\/Karajan but in this context a worthy competitor.\n\nWe are fortunate here to be offered the complete Nutcracker Ballet, offered elsewhere in these compilations as less than complete. (There are many overlaps in this set but their significance will depend on how many of the other (\"Essential\" etc) BIS compliations you have). The Bonn Classical Philharmonic and Heribert Beissel are the players here, a real orchestra with a real conductor. Such is the German commitment to classical music that it seems that every town or city will have its own orchestra, or two (Bonn also has its Beethoven Orchestra). Here we have a complete ballet, with all the numbers, some of which are less memorable than others. It's good to have it complete,and the playing is more than competent, even if we don't have the string perfection of the Berlin Philiharmonic.\n\nWe also have the suite from Swan Lake - played by Hungarian State Orchestra and Emil Edlinger - another competent performance and recording - and a few piano pieces, including a nicely played Barcarolle from The Seasons.\n\nThis is a compilation that is priced a little above the usual deal prices of 99cents, or $1.99 but I think it is worth it if you don't have too many duplicates in your collection. In my opinion the symphonies and violin concerto are worth this by themselves.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Trey Songz can be considered the most successful \"baby making\" R&B singer as of right now and you cannot deny the man's worth ethic. I loved his previous works especially \"Ready\" and \"Passion, Pain & Pleasure\" which showed a drastic evolution of Trey's artistry. Ready (Trey's greatest work) was Trey mastering his sound as a pure sex driven man as well as an allure variety of slow jams. Passion, Pain & Pleasure amassed a more pop-crossover sound and probably Trey's most experimental album to date. And now we come to his latest project Chapter V, a long 18 track album. Now, right off the back the album title Chapter V is already unoriginal, this is his 5th album and every album before this one was (in theory) like a chapter in his life which is already a disjointed idea because at least 70% of all his albums contained no real themes besides his latest 2 releases. The dissapointing thing about this album is that it tries to repeat the magic he created from the last 2 albums filling itself with interludes and an array set of songs. The problem with this album is that unlike Ready or PPP, the concepts don't tie in very smoothly and the interludes serve no purpose when they transition into the next songs. The sequencing of the album is very sloppy and Trey's song writing seems to have gotten worse than his latest attempts. Chapter V has no real focus, just an album full of singles.\n\nSadly I only happened to enjoy 5 tracks and thats it. There are 18 freakin tracks and I only liked 5 whereas the last 2 albums I can pretty much listen to the entire albums all the way through. Tracks like \"Panty Wetter\" is a prime example of a slow jam being done correctly. Songs about sex is how Trey Songz established himself and this is where he works the best, this is the lane where Trey can lap any other R&B artist even Usher and Frank Ocean at the moment. \"Dive In\" and \"Fumble\" are ballads that are very reminicent of his previous songs like \"Neighbors Know My Name\" and \"Love Faces\". But I can feel that Trey is more comfortable with these type of songs in contrast to the other songs which I will elaborate later on. The last 2 songs I did happen to enjoy happen to be \"Without A Woman\" and \"Pretty Girls Lie\" which contain a lot more substance compared to the the majority of the album. Now with R&B music, it is really difficult to think of concepts about love that hasn't been done before, and Trey still hasn't accomplished that yet but at least he does try to have a little variety.\n\nNow the negatives of the album are present all over the place. Every song on the album that featured a guest rapper (and there are actually a lot) all suck in my opinion. Each feature was neither memorable nor necessarily needed and they lacked the chemistry that Trey has had in the past with rappers like Nicki Minaj, Drake or Fabolous. The horrendous track \"2 Reasons\" with T.I. was a down graded version of \"Say Ahh\" and \"Bottoms Up\". The track with Young Jeezy and Lil Wayne uses Football as a metaphor to connect with girls, but fails miserably. I completely hated the track \"Check Me Out\" featuring the overrated Meek Mill and the always annoying Diddy which should not have been added to the tracklist nontheless should have never been chosen to end the album before the outro. The song with Rick Ross wasn't actually bad but Rick Ross didn't add anything spectacular to the song and could've easily been done without him on the song. The MAIN problem I have with this album is that this is Trey just doing the same old thing, just a different year. Nothing on the album was very memorable nor groundbreaking compared to the other songs he has created in the past. Nothing on the album is really any different than his previous albums and I think the main thing that bothers me is that now he really is trying to do pop tracks, as opposed to experimenting with pop sounds, which is sad because I do not think his voice appeals to pop music, his voice is way to sensual. Now I may sound like a hater but it is what is, this album just didn't do anything for me, and half the time Trey's voice may have sounded good, but his god awful corny songwriting just killed it for me. As of now I don't think I will ever buy another Trey Songz album from here on out because I just realized that his talent really peaked with his 3rd album Ready, and I have a strong feeling that he is just going to continue to make albums that are just more and more similar each time.","classification":2,"fold":2}

All the great composers are represented here, and a fairly good portion of great players too.  This collection is most similar to the essential classics from X5.\n\nThe MP3 ID tags are wrong.  Many of these works have the composers listed under the \"Conductor\" value.  And in other cases, the actual conductor names are there and the composer's name appears nowhere.  Fortunately this collection has been ordered by composer for simplicity.  It seems to mainly be comprised of the Rise of the Masters collections for each composer, so if you buy all of those you may not need this set.

{"text":"Brazilian pianist Isabel Mourao's performances of solo piano music of Edvard Grieg were first released on the LP by the Vox label in 1971, in two volumes each containing 3 LPs. The were later released on Vox CD, again in 2 volumes (3 CD's and 2 CD's respectively), and since that time they've began to appear in various compilations available as downloads.\n\nBillboard magazine, in February 1971, announcing the availability of these recordings on Vox, said \"The first unified collection of Grieg piano music is offered in two Vox Records three-LP boxes. Isabel Mourao is superb as the soloist in these two volumes, each of which is packed with individual riches. Combined, however, these boxes offer a collection of Grieg's music for solo piano, showing a side of the composer not previously appreciated.\"\n\nThe ultimate collection of these performances is this 'LittleVoxBox Edition', which includes all of those performances, in one 140-track collection, 5 hrs and 47 minutes of music altogether, and an exceptional value on Amazon as currently priced (99 cents for all 140 tracks, download only). See the bottom of this review for some of the listings of this music on Amazon, where I've tried to help identify which are the best value.\n\nThis is very comprehensive for these compositions of Grieg but not complete in all cases. I've listed below the music included in the collection, indicating works as either complete or with a few movements omitted.\n\nInformation on pianist Mourao is very difficult to find on the internet. She was born in 1932, and is reported to have been the first pianist to record all the Lyric pieces by Grieg. She made her New York debut recital at Town Hall in 1953 (her performances of Chopin, Mozart and Villa-Lobos from that debut recital are available on youtube).\n\nThese are very natural, enjoyable performances. The recorded sound quality is very good. The music and performances are delightful, and at the bargain price for this collection it is hard to pass up, for those who are download friendly.\n\ntrack .....  music  (works are complete unless otherwise indicated)\n\n1-4: Sonata in E Minor, Op. 7 (complete)\n5-11: Lyric Pieces, Book I, Op. 12 (Nos. 1-7, omitting 8, National Song)\n12-18: Lyric Pieces, Book II, Op. 38 (Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, omitting 3, Melody)\n19-24: Lyric Pieces, Book III, Op. 43 (Nos. 1-6, complete)\n25-30: Lyric Pieces, Book IV, Op. 47 (Nos. 1-6, omitting 7, Elegy)\n31-36: Lyric Pieces, Book V, Op. 54 (Nos. 1-6, complete)\n37-41: Lyric Pieces, Book VI, Op. 57 (Nos. 1, 2, 4-6, omitting 3, Illusion)\n42-47: Lyric Pieces, Book VII, Op. 62 (Nos. 1-6, complete)\n48-50: Humoresques, Op. 6: No. 1, 2, 4 (omitting 3, Allegretto con grazia)\n51-56: Lyric Pieces, Book VIII, Op. 65 (Nos. 1-6, complete)\n57-61: Lyric Pieces, Book IX, Op. 68 (Nos. 2-6, omitting 1, Sailors' Song)\n62-67: Lyric Pieces, Book X, Op. 71 (Nos. 1-5, 7, omitting 6, Gone)\n68-70: Scenes of Country Life, Op. 19 (complete)\n71: Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak\n72: Ballade in G Minor, Op. 24\n73-74: From Four Pieces, Op. 1: Nos, 1, 2 (omitting Nos. 3, 4)\n75-77: Poetic Tone Pictures, Op. 3: Nos. 1, 5, 6 (omitting Nos. 2-4)\n78-98: Norwegian Dances and Folksongs, Op. 17 (Nos. 1-10, 12-13, 15-16, 18-25, omitting Nos. 11, 14, 17)\n99-108: Norwegian Peasant Dances, Op. 72 (Nos. 2-4, 6, 8, 10-11, 15-17, omitting Nos. 1, 5, 7, 9, 12-14)\n109-112: Album Leaves, Op. 28 (complete)\n113-114: Improvisations on Two Norwegian Folksongs, Op. 29 (complete)\n115-119: From Holberg's Time, Op. 40 (complete)\n120-135: From Nineteen Norwegian Folk Melodies, Op. 66: (Nos. 1-16, omitting Nos. 17-19)\n136-140: Moods, Op. 73 (Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, omitting Nos. 1, 6)\n\nLISTINGS ON AMAZON FOR ISABEL MOURAO's GRIEG PERFORMANCES:\n\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Grieg-Works-for-Solo-Piano-The-LittleVoxBox-Edition\/dp\/B00V63SKPW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Grieg: Works for Solo Piano (The LittleVoxBox Edition)<\/a>&nbsp;-- the complete collection, all 140 tracks as listed above, a Bargain at 99 cents currently\n-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Grieg-Solo-Piano-Music-Vol-1\/dp\/B000001K6I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Grieg: Solo Piano Music, Vol. 1<\/a>&nbsp;-- the Vox Vol I release, available on Amazon as either CD or .mp3 download.

The song grew on me after I listened to it many times on the radio stations that were playing it.  I also enjoyed the video to this song and highly recommend it for those who may be undecided about purchasing the song.  It is a heartwarming love song and communicates a message of lasting love with the lyrics \"Not Even Death Can Make Us Part\".  Please know that my husband and I have a healthy partnership and that we both actually encourage each other to move on to the next realm whenever we both pass away.  It is just that from my subjective but humble perspective,the lyrics of \"Not Even Death Can Make Us Part\" symbolize a message of a powerful love that withstands any mortal challenges and only gets better. \"Sweet Dreams\" by Beyonce is great for either those who enjoy Beyonce's music and\/or tracks containing musical hybrids of hip hop and dance.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"It's been nearly four years since Bloc Party released their last album, Intimacy. Since then the band members have gone on to various side projects and for a time it was questionable as to whether or not the band would even reunite and put out another record. I've been a big fan ever since I first heard their stunning 2005 debut, Silent Alarm, and I've constantly admired the way they've managed to push themselves musically and continually challenge their audience. Four is a welcome return that, while not the knockout some of us might have been hoping for, affirms that this band has plenty of life left but that they're also trying to find footing in too many different fields.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: this album is not Silent Alarm. That's a brilliant album and it's ridiculous to expect the band to keep making that album over and over. Some of that same energy is certainly present here but it's channeled in a very different way. The opener \"So He Begins to Lie\" perfectly sets the stage for what we can expect. The crunchy guitars and rush of drums are classic Bloc Party but they also have a weight and pacing about them that's refreshingly mature. There's also a slight problem with this song, and it's one that peppers many of the other tracks on Four: it doesn't necessarily build up to anything special.\n\n\"Octopus\", the record's first single, is a prime example of this. It has an uptempo and danceable strut to it but ultimately it's not memorable the way many of their past singles have been. This is the one sore spot that I've had with this record: it doesn't stand out. The hooks are missing for the most part and the energy is all over the place, either feeling too forced or misguided.\n\nThat's not to say that everything here is underwhelming. \"Kettling\" is a monster of a song and sonically captures the noisy post-punk that made them so beloved to start with. \"Real Talk\" and \"Day Four\" slow the album down into pop territory but they work wonderfully, especially due to frontman Kele Okereke's gentle and gliding voice. His vocals are often pushed back in the mix this time around, causing the rest of the band to be a wall of sound around him. In the right hands this is a powerful weapon but Bloc Party has always relied heavily on Kele's soaring and passionate voice to help carry many of the songs.  His lyrics this time around are also much more vague, which is disappointing when you consider the depth and honesty he's typically known for. Vagary works for Michael Stipe and Beck but it doesn't suit the more upfront music that this band does so well.\n\n\"V.A.L.I.S.\" is the kind of track that feels instantly familiar. It's a bit difficult to describe for those not familiar with the group but if you're versed in their music then you'll instantly understand what I'm talking about. It's a lot of fun and one of the more memorable cuts on the album. \"The Healing\" and \"Truth\" show some promise but slide by a bit too easily to stick in your head once they're over, though they do get points for creating an interesting atmosphere. The closer \"We Are Not Good People\" is a noisy and screaming track that attempts something heavy but just comes off as overdone and uncomfortable.\n\nI applaud an artist for trying new things and Bloc Party has always been a daring group. Four isn't a bad record but it isn't a great one either. After four years the band seems to have gotten distracted by other projects and have lost that tight, focused sound that made them so exciting in the first place. I've been of the belief that this band is one of the best and most promising up-and-coming acts on the indie scene for years. However, this record doesn't really cement that legacy but rather barely keeps the fire going. This record simply doesn't know what it wants to be: pop, punk, metal, alternative? It just doesn't flow the way it should and it's hard to say who's at fault. Don't get me wrong: this is an enjoyable album and one that gets better with repeated listens. It just isn't enough to carry it from good to great, and at this stage in their career I know the band should be in the great category.","classification":3,"fold":2}

Fierce, furious guitar solos that color, accentuate, punctuate, and razzle dazzle throughout every song. My congratulations to the band on creating such an excellent record. Dave Mustaine is at the peak of his creative powers right here, and Kiko Loureiro is an amazing talent who might be even better than the great Marty Friedman and even Chris Poland. I recommend fans buy the version of the album that includes \"Look Who's Talking\", as that track is one of my favorites. I also really dig the title track, \"Poisonous Shadows\", \"The Emperor\", \"Lying In State\", \"Post American World\", etc. Great job Megadeth.

{"text":"Lupe Fiasco's first two albums (\"Food and Liquor\", \"The Cool\") were both excellent albums from start to finish. Much of the hip-hop community and almost all of his fans agree.  A lot of people disliked his third one \"Lasers\" but I actually liked it.  There were some weak spots, but there were many strong tracks on it.\n\n\"Food and Liquor 2\" (FL2) is another great addition to Lupe's catalogue.  It's not as excellent as FL or TC, but close to being. As always, there is some excellent lyricism here by Lupe.  He addresses touchy topics about America, terrorism, pop culture, race and religion in a clever and thought provoking way.  The tracks segue well and flow together nicely.  The mood is never suddenly altered and always uplifting. To be honest though, the production and beats are not particularly strong. They're good, just nothing special.\n\nSome of the stronger tracks on the album IMHO are \"B***h Bad\", \"Audubon Ballroom\", \"ITAL\", \"Battle Scars\", \"Around My Way\", \"Form Follows Function\", and \"Lamborghini Angels\".  The only tracks I didn't like are \"Heart Donor\" and \"How Dare You\". Most tracks are mid-tempo.  \"Audubon Ballroom\" has the hardest beats. Most tracks address social issues, from sexism in \"B***h Bad\" to US foreign policy in the Middle East (\"ITAL\").  \"Form Follows Function\" is a jazz-infused song.  The only song pop crossover song is \"Battle Scars\" (ft. Australian singer Guy Sebastian), about the harshness of relationships.  \"Around My Way\" samples a 1992 classic by Pete Rock (\"T.R.O.Y.\").  While a bit uncreative, it does introduce the younger generation to a 20-year old hip-hop classic.\n\nAll in all, FL2 is probably the second best hip-hop of the year (after \"Life Is Good\").\n\n(4  out of 5 stars)","classification":5,"fold":2}

All in all,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/R-B-Diva\/dp\/B009BI8PEA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">R&B Diva<\/a>&nbsp;is a solid album, with some fine moments and other less notable ones.\n\n\"Lovin' Me (Theme From R&B Divas)\" starts the effort of energetically, delivering capable vocal performances from the R&B singers. The production is sound and the song itself is quite enjoyable, transcending its role as a 'theme' song, much like Mary Mary's \"Go Get It\" (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Go-Get-It\/dp\/B007LCJ1RS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Go Get It<\/a>) is solid as its own entity. Faith Evans steals the show on the classic, soulful-sounding \"Tears of Joy,\" the promo\/buzz single of the set. Evans sounds in superb voice here, hearkening back to the days of her musical prime when Evans was one of the preeminent R&B females in the game. \"Tears of Joy\" is the perfect cut for Evans's robust and powerful voice.\n\n\"Mr. Supafly\" accelerates the tempo following \"Tears of Joy.\" It's not bad, but \"Too High For Love\" is more powerful, showing more range. \"Too High For Love\" features Faith Evans, who sounds exceptional here.  Talk about underrated, Wyatt's career has been just that, despite possessing the voice. \"SisterFriend\" provides the obligatory 'sisters forever' styled track, but it is effective. Women will definitely relate to it, much like a similarly themed track entitled \"Sisters\" from Angie Stone's latest,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rich-Girl\/dp\/B008D1RD5S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rich Girl<\/a>.\n\n\"Dumb\" possesses some of the efforts most interesting production, giving into uptempo fair. The vocal harmonies pop well here against the repetitive organ synth. \"Sometime\" follows, featuring Nicci Gilbert & her mother, Helene \"Mom\" Gilbert. It is OK, though by no means 'new' or 'the second coming. \"True Colors\" is a high point for sure, featuring Kelly Price and Fantasia.  The vocal harmonies are lovely while the production is both smoothly and soulfully executed.\n\n\"Stonewall,\" featuring Syleena Johnson (whose voice I dearly love) is a bit of miss.  While the concept of the song is excellent, the pitch is not. More often than not, the pitch rises (sharp) and instead of adding 'color' to the cut, it hinders it. Sometimes pitch imperfections are positive nuances despite their inaccuracy. In this case, \"Stonewall\" has too many runs and is hindered by inaccuracy.\n\n\"She's Me,\" featuring Monifah is 'standard fare' while the preeminent diva herself (Faith) shines on a live take of her 1995 classic, \"Soon As I Get Home.\" Kelly Price takes us to church on closing cut \"Jesus Loves,\"which is incredibly inspiration if ever so slightly overwrought.\n\nOverall,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/R-B-Diva\/dp\/B009BI8PEA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">R&B Diva<\/a>&nbsp;is an enjoyable, though not revolutionary compilation. For a compilation, it works effectively, with selections \"Lovin' Me,\" \"Tears of Joy,\"\"Too High For Love,\" and \"True Colors\" serving as the representative hits. R&B Divas? Maybe\/maybe not, but there is little (save for the pitch problems\/missed opportunity \"Stonewall\") to hang one's head about here.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"This, in my opinion, is Train's best album to date. That is not to say the others weren't brilliant, because I love them all. But this one is true perfection.\n\nPat Monahan is one of the most gifted, most underrated singers I know of. He brings an emotional connection to every word he sings. His phrasing is unique, always sitting in the music in a way that feels like they cradle each other, melding together. And his voice! I have had the pleasure of seeing Train - and Pat Monahan solo - perform live multiple times. I don't think it's possible to truly grasp his power and pitch-perfect vocals until you see him sing live. Some performers need all the gadgets in a studio to make them sound good. Pat Monahan doesn't even need a microphone to fill up a venue.\n\nLyrically, we have the best of Train's signature storytelling. The words are poetic, the imagery profound.\n\nMost of the music is uptempo and certainly contagious. This is feel good, addictive, crank the volume and dance in your living room music!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This CD is the second recent CD by Heart, I purchased. I am a fan from way back in the 1970's...Dreamboat Annie.\nIts Great to hear Ann shouting with that Still GREAT rock and roll voice she shared with us all these years. There are some Good songs here including the title song \"Fanatic\". Heart has a more stripped down and rocking sound then the original group and I think that is Great. They are not trying to sound like they did thirty years ago. I saw Ann and Nancy Live last year, and I was Blown away by Ann's voice. Saw her again on the Kennedy Center Honors. She did a wonderful cover of Stairway to Heaven. I think Heart has been successful in establishing a new sound and on this album they rock harder then the last one. I hope Heart just rolls on and on. Ann and Nancy certainly look and sound like they can. I recommend this one for old timers like me and new fans as well. Great release in a time where music seems pretty Lame.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"First Listen yesterday, and I enjoyed the work. This is still Rob Zombie, but its different... it's called varying and experimentation people. I think that some people have a clone expectation of some artists. But the sales  numbers have shown that a huge number of people like this  work. Radio got behind this work because the Rob Zombie fan club helped  push a great product. If you listen to what Rob Zombie has said in his so-called  film hiatus  from music, the way he creates is both visual as well as audio. I think this disc is perfectly in tune with his other work, its a different \"Vision\" maybe, and whilst items like HELLBILLY DELUXE are items I would play more often, if Rob only has 38 Minutes of music for this disc, then so be it, I certainly don't want him to redo the disc and come up with a new disc like AMERICAN MADE MUSIC  TO STRIP BY, which is a remix of another album... even though I do like AMERICAN MADE MUSIC TO STRIP BY.\n\nTake a look at the Booklet in EDUCATED HORSES, and compare it  to the other Booklet in HELLBILLY DELUXE, you can see the imagery difference, different album, same Rob, different Vision.\n\nGive some of the tracks a listen, this album is a good one. Not everyone can produce the amount of material that Alice Cooper  does, but we can hope that they will, however an artist is an artist not a production coffee  machine.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Smile on your face type of music.\nFantastic melodies. I generally like it rockier but these tunes are hard to resist. A very pleasing follow up to to his debut.\nFar superior to Flamingo and rivalling The Killers best. It's hard not to like every track on offer on this dud-less album.\n\nDreams Come True - A great up tempo opener. Catchy and fun with great chanting at the end.\nCant Deny My Love - Doesn't take long to grow on you. Classy lead single\nI Can Change - six writers for a generally simple and repeatable lyric but perhaps my fave track\nStill Want You - is perhaps my least liked song on offer. Still good but four identical (and longish) chorus repeats ruins it a bit for me.\nDiggin Up the Heart - or is this my fave? pure 80's, put on the spandex and get out your aerobics moves. I don't dance - but to this (alone of course) I do.\nBetween Me And You - down tempo and dreamy, lovely.\nLonely Town - Apart from one line of Cher inspired digital voice warping it's another catchy and fun track\nNever Get You Right - is an 80's feeling power ballad. A great tune.\nUntangled Love - is a tad generic sounding but hard not to like.\nThe Way It's Always Been - is a nice closer.\nThe Desired Effect - like on Flamingo (Right Behind You), for some reason he's left one of the best tracks a bonus!!\n\nA Grade stuff here.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Regina Spektor's last album, 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Far\/dp\/B002COTI64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Far<\/a>, found the singer-songwriter at her most accessible.  This move seemed to put off long-time fans; Spektor's appeal before finding her way to VH1 was her offkilter songwriting.  With WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS, Spektor has returned to the fun, strange songwriting that initially brought her into the spotlight.  This album was produced by Mike Elizondo (who also worked on FAR): perhaps most well known for taking Fiona Apple's EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and giving it a streamlined and focused spin.\n\nWHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS is hard to predict.  Not only do songs range in tempo, tone, and mood from one song to the next, these shifts can happen mid-song (notably in the album opener \"Small Town Moon.\")  Listeners can, however, expect the impulse-driven piano pop that mixes blends of genre, nonsense, and convention.  The changes in style never feel like Spektor is aping a genre or playing the chameleon; instead, it feels as if Spektor's imagination is running wild in the studio.  The result is an interesting, fun album.\n\nThe opening \"Small Town Moon\" begins as a conventional piano pop song, but it soon gives way to typical Spektor mannerisms (starts, stops, repetition, etc...) before ultimately opening up into a stomping chant of \"Everybody not so nice, nice.\"  It's hard to really describe it, but it's great fun to experience.  \"Oh Marcello\" is similar in its unpredictability, ranging from wild falsettos to beatboxing from Spektor.  This is followed by \"Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas),\" a song that incorporates hints of tropical music with horns and a Russian chorus.  Not all of the songs on the album are quite so wild; \"Firewood\" is a simple, soulful song composed Spektor's piano and a drumset -- it makes for one of the most inspired passes of Spektor's lyricism.  The only real problem I have with CHEAP SEATS is that it feels scattershot.  Some of the songs feel less developed than others (compare \"All the Rowboats\" to \"Ballad of a Politician,\" for example).  While the album gets a strong start, the Beatles-esque closer, \"Jessica\" doesn't quite feel like a good way to wrap up the album.\n\nRecommended sampling: \"Small Town Moon,\" \"All the Rowboats,\" and \"Oh Marcello\".  Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Fiona-Apple\/dp\/B000B0WOEO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fiona Apple<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Feist\/dp\/B000V9D0XY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Feist<\/a>&nbsp;will probably find a lot to like here.  If you like any of Spektor's previous releases, this album is worth you time and money.\n\nADDITIONAL RELEASE INFO:  A deluxe edition of WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS was released.  If contains three songs that didn't make it onto the album.  These songs are:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Call-Them-Brothers-feat-Only-Son\/dp\/B0082JYGHE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Call Them Brothers (feat.

Not all songs are meant to make us feel good, but sometimes it brings us closer to the reality we face in life, and Holding Back the Years does that to me.\n\nI love the ending after he lays it all out he sings:\n\nTHAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.....\n\nHe said it all too.

{"text":"Mezzanine is one of my all time favourite albums. It's just that good. the arrangements, the production and the wibe on the album. It's dark and beautiful and the musicianship is also top notch. the Album has many guest appearences and the lads from Massive are geniuses to find the right people to sing the right songs. Teardrop is now a classic and many other songs are also brilliant. I recomend everyone who claims to be a music fan to buy Mezzanine. It is indded one of the best albums of the late 90's and probably of all time.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"Wow!  This is an album that explodes from the gate growling, with razor-sharp teeth bared.  On their 8th album (the first in 10 years) this Portland, Oregon band sounds reinvigorated, spewing a terse, jagged and insightful anger with a wild, on-the-edge punk energy.  The angular roar of spitting guitars and hard-hitting, maniacal vocals displays a resilience of character and vehement power that is rare in the indie rock world.  The songs are incredibly tight, fresh and invigoratinga slap in the face that stings you awake.  Members have played in Wild Flag, Quasi, Heavens To Betsy, Excuse 17.  Recalls bands like Au Pairs, Gang Of Four, Savages, Team Dresch, Savages, Bikini Kill.  No Cities To Love is a blast of post-punk rock honesty that might shake both your foundations and your hips.  Killer!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is a great new release, of Third Day's unique brand of Southern Christian Rock. Third Day is from Atlanta, and I noticed they included \"ATL.GA\", on the front cover of this CD. I've seen this band perform live, in Bossier City, Louisiana, on their \"Live Revelations\" Tour, and they are fantastic. This CD is full of great songs, of praise, worship and encouragement. Featured songs as listed on the label, include, \"Lift Up Your Face\", \"Children of God\", and \"Surrender\". These are indeed great songs, and are certainly destined to become major hits on Contemporary Christian Radio Stations. Some may even cross over into the rock & pop charts, just as some of Third Day's prior songs have.\n\nThis album is featured as more of a contemporary, Christian Rock, album, with a \"Southern\" sound, than a \"Praise & Worship\" Album, such as the \"Offerings\" series. It's certainly a fantastic album, full of great songs, with great gospel messages. I really love it.\n\nOverall, this is another great one, from Third Day. If you like Third Day, Contemporary Christian Music, Praise & Worship Music, and\/or Southern Rock, then you should really enjoy this CD. Thanks and May God Bless!!!\n\nP.S. I attended a Third Day Concert, last night,(March 18, 2011) in Monroe, Louisiana, on their \"Make Your Move Tour\". \"Wow\", what a treat!!!! It was awesome!!!! They really \"Rocked\" the University of Louisiana at Monroe's Coliseum. The place was packed, the crowd was really \"into it\", and Third Day, certainly delivered one \"Super-Outstanding\" Concert. They featured songs from this new album \"Move\", plus some of their classics, & some requests from the audience. One of their songs (\"Born Again\" from their \"Revelation\" Album), was selected to be in a major, movie, entitled \"7 Days in Utopia\", to be released later this year. We got to see a preview of this movie, at the concert. Also, the band promoted their \"Southern Rock\", style. I bought a cap that has \"Atlanta, GA, Third Day, Est. 1992, Original Rock & Roll Quality\".  Also, I bought a T-Shirt that has an  Eagle logo, & Third Day \"Move\" logo, on the front, and it has a logo on the back, with the words: \"Pure Southern Rock & Roll\". So, they are proud of & promoting  their \"Southern Christian Rock\", music style. If you get a chance to attend a concert on this 40 city tour, please by all means, attend, you'll love it, and be blessed. I LOVE THIS BAND!!!! MAY GOD BLESS THIRD DAY!!! THANKS AGAIN!!!","classification":5,"fold":2}

This album is a true gem of musicianship!\n\nThis album, many of the tracks were rehearsed while Jim was alive and wouda been the next album. Ray Manzerik comes in on most of the vocals and does a very good job.\n\nYou can since the songs structure and feel were made for Jim Morrison to come in the studio and lay down his vocals on the tracks, but it didn't happen.\n\n\"Tightrope Ride\" was the single released and I am amazed it wasn't atleast a top 40 hit, the album must not have been promoted too much by the label, although it did reach No. 35 on the charts and thats not bad, having the 35th most popular album in America.\n\nThe song \"Ships with Sails\" is a amazing song and if you heard it, you'd KNOW it's classic Doors all the way, a great 6+ min tune that kinda resembles \"Riders on the storm\".\n\nThis album has been ignored long enough, bring it back, release it on CD, its not a Morrison release, but its the Doors and it's a great album!","classification":5,"fold":2}

Other great tracks include \"You Are\" (great lyrics), \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" (great drums\/bass combinations, great varied pitch vocals & the song featuring the fabulous Fantasia), \"Life Of The Party\" (great dance track with great vocals), \"I Can't Go\", \"Crying For You\" & \"Where Would I Be?\" (Great harmonies). The only okay\/good track is \"Never Got Enough\" & there is no weak track on this fantastic CD to really speak of. Solid tracks include \"Once And Forever\" (a beautiful ballad track, wonderful music, great vocals & very persuasive lyrics) & \"Lotto\" (fantastic sound intro, wonderful piano note pickings throughout the song, great rhythm guitar thrown appropriately at intervals, great melody & chorus.

As far as the studio cuts are concerned, my favorites are: Unbroken Chain, China doll, U.S. blues, and my personal favorite Scarlet Begonias. Bonus cuts are awesome: live renditions of Scarlet, an early version of U.S Blues, and a smokin rendition of Chuck Berry's Let It Rock, recorded live at the old Miami Jai Alai.

{"text":"Lifehouse went a totally different direction on this album, away from the pop oriented sound on their debut album, and onto a more mature, dynamic sound.  My first few listens were judgmental, and I didn't give the album a fair chance to shine, because I was expecting more poppy hooks and rhythms.  After I let that out of my head, I listened to some pretty excellent music.\nWithout a doubt, the two best songs on the album are \"How Long\" and \"The Beginning\", two of the last songs on the album.  They show maturity as a band, and there is a Pink Floyd kind of feel to them, as the songs make you drift off and you feel like everything will be OK upon listening, and shortly thereafter.\n\"Just Another Name\", \"Anchor\", and \"Am I ever Gonna Find out\" are other stand out tracks, and sort of have a pop sound to them, with catchy hooks.\nJason Wade is a brilliant writer, and has a unique voice.  I look forward to Lifehouse's future work, as they are on the verge of putting out a masterpiece with their current evolution.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Richard Marx has this unique ability with his voice and his songwriting to capture these really beautiful human emotions, which certainly wasn't the standard of the rather plastic and superficial music scene of the 1980's. Marx strikes again with \"Endless Summer Nights.\" It tells the very intimate story of a summer love that for whatever reason is not going on anymore. We've all had these summer loves that stamp our lives in some way. There's this very real feeling--question really of where did it go? You wake up one morning and its' gone. There's a very proud tradition in this arena, but with cool mournful lyrics and vocal tones, Endless Summer Nights stands away from the others.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Ive had this cd well over a year. Its OK, but you really have to be in the mood for it. You must have time to listen.\nIts dark, moody, cold and some of the songs drag a bit. The ambiance is good, but the songs tend to stay mid paced and lack a particular structure.\nIts OK, but nothing i would highly reccomend to the average metal listener. Even far removed for old Celtic fans. But good for a listen or 2 here and there. 'Domain of Decay' sounds a bit like old frost though. And the track 'Obscured' is just moody, cold, dark and perfect.\n\nI credit them for doing what they wanted. And its not bad, just different.","classification":3,"fold":2}

Songs like the churning \"I ain't new to this\", \"So cold\", \"I want it all\" (on which she passionately tells us she wants 40 acres and a mule, a platinum record, free education, to kill all disease and the war to cease, among other desires), and the bouncy pair of the horn-sprinkled \"Party all night\", and \"Let it roll\".\n\nEverything else ranges from midtempo to slow; the beautiful ballad \"Mr. Incredible, Ms. Unforgetable\" (with the creamy vocals of Raheem DeVaughn), the Staple Singers-style \"Tell me you love me\" (on which she reminds me of Joss Stone, it has a great guitar solo) the lulling \"Supa luva\", the groovy Prince-style \"If it's wrong\", and the stunning \"It's over\" (with some helium-filled vocal flourishes).\n\nHighlight though has got to be \"The fact is\", a lush ballad with sporadic bursts of bass and a seventies-style spoken bridge.

{"text":"There's gonna be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album! The most important thing is to keep an open mind. Indeed, Jewel has traded in her acoustic guitar for a new dance floor sound. Indeed, she looks like an 80's Cyndi Lauper on the cd cover. Yet, the biggest thing Jewel has NOT done is sell out. She may look and sound different, but Jewel has remained true to her heart. She has proven that one doesn't need an acoustic guitar to make meaningful music. At the same time, she proves that rhythmic music can be very meaningful as well. Anyone who has listened to the lyrics of 'Intuition' carefully has already figured this out. Jewel is mocking commercialism and materialism! Or, making political and societal statements (if you will). Is this really so different from what she has done in the past? The 'Intuition' video is the biggest mockery of all! The video displays Jewel: The Actress. The songs 'U & Me = Love' and '2 Become 1' follow, lyrically, in the tradition of Jewel's 1996 mega hit 'You were meant for me.' 'America' is yet another song where Jewel discusses the many aspects of American society and makes poilitcal statements. Gosh, this sounds like the same girl to me! Although, despite keeping her lyrics true to heart, the dance beats heard throughout make this cd Jewel's most fun project to date. Heck, it's dance music! Meaningful lyrics or not, it's still fun to listen to! Be sure to listen to the lyrics of each song carefully. You'll discover that Jewel has not, in any way, created fluffy, mindless pop (which some people are accussing her of doing). It's rare to find dance music with a purpose beyond just making people feel energized and relaxed. This album proves that the very essence of Jewel will never change (even though the music has).","classification":4,"fold":2}

I find them elegant and as satisfying as those of the most notable symphonic composers. Unfortunately, there are only three real symphonies, \"The Bells\" and the Youth Symphony being somewhat different in structure. The concertos speak for themselves and the \"miscellaneous\" orchestral works are equally entertaining. One point of contention is this: the orchestral works could be considered incomplete; BUT, it depends on how strictly one defines orchestral. There are other works that were written for piano that have been transcribed for orchestra. They are equally listenable in that format but are (strictly speaking) not orchestral works. As for quality, I found no appreciable difference between these early Leonard Slatkin conducted recordings and the others in my library. A real find at the price.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.\n\nProduced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues\/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.\n\nI'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come.","classification":5,"fold":2}

For me Louis almost ruined the song, but thank goodness the other three picked up his slack and saved the song. Great fun song to sing along to in the car or while working out.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Audio quality is very good, with a wide ambiance like a symphony feel.\n\nThe tracks have a 101 Strings quality and might be all from that group, though the tracks give credit to the singers in preference to the musicians. Or they may have been selected for the similar stylings.  The lyrics are clear, easy to understand, and well sung.  The general tone is lyrical and sweet, with long-held notes.  Several tracks also have a harp - a nice touch.  While I don't, personally, care that much for the 'saccharine' quality of 101 Strings, or the rather slow tempo of all these tracks, others may prefer this sound to the 'bouncier' tunes with a more intimate and 'bluegrassy' feel that I like more, such as those of the Celtic Sampler Summer 2009 (which the insert a link doesn't find, more's the pity).\n\nTrack by track:\n1. Full instrumental, aka Danny Boy, full string orchestra, slow tempo.\n2. Some Celtic and then English. \"with lightsome heart, I pulled a rose full sweet upon the thorny tree\" (in case you know those lyrics).\n3. I plan to keep this track a while as it is the \"I'll take the high road, and you'll take the low road\" song, and I've always wanted to learn more than just those lines.\n4. I think everyone knows this song by this title.\n5. I learned this one from Joan Baez many years ago, and I like her rendition far better - but that's my taste, not a reflection on the quality of this track.\n6. \"Cockles and mussels, alive alive-O\" with backing chorus as well.  Waltz almost fast enough to dance to.\n7. Flute, violin, harp, strings.  Slow & dreamy with 'surprise' percussive moments.\n8. Almost 'bouncy' acapella (nearly - a touch of backing guitar\/banjo) - may not be 101 Strings - has a more 'intimate' feeling. \"I wooed her in the wintertime, part of the summer too, and the only only thing that I did that was wrong was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew.\"\n9. Piano accompaniment, mainly.  \"I can see a soft moon shining on the water by the mill, and the silver ribbon winding by the house upon the hill.\"\n10. Full strings plus harp & chimes. Wistful ballad. \"smiling, beguiling... together oft over the mountains we strayed.  With each other delighted...\"\n\n7,8,9&10 are more 'intimate' and, to me, more enjoyable than 1-6.  Hope this helps you decide what to try.","classification":4,"fold":2}

She has had one good collaboration when she did work with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You from A Good Girl Gone Bad, but she has had ones that have felt more like she is wasted in heart, especially when she made the decision to go back to her ex who abused her before the Grammy Awards, Chris Brown. Her latest collaboration in Stay with newcomer Mikky Echo is not really a strong one, and feels weak in the voice and connection. Mikky takes a bit to get used to because he hasn't really been anything but in music other than this song alone. I really found it to be one of her weaker songs in ballads alone.

I won't pretend that the pieces being featured on this mp3 download aren't rather haphazard (when I go looking to buy music, it's usually to find sets of things - for example, albums with all of a composer's symphonies on them); this album has fine recordings of many, many of Beethoven's works for a variety of groups, a few of which I have never heard before, such as the incidental music to Egmont (having played the overture, this actually fascinates me).  However, the exact selection seems almost random; several of his String Quartets appear, but out of order and only a few; similarly, only a few of the symphonies are featured.\n\nRegardless of its organization and selection, there is a lot of music here, and I can't imagine it going for this kind of price anywhere else.  The recordings are good quality, and the presence of less-commonly-heard works makes it all the better.  So really, this is a ridiculously good deal.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I was a very big fan of the original \"Basement Tapes\" by Dylan and The Band, so like so many other listeners I had high expectations or this album. Initially, I was a bit disappointed. It took me a long time ---- many, many listens --- to properly absorb and appreciate these songs. At some point it all finally gelled and clicked and I'm confident in saying; this is a mighty fine album!\n\nBesides the Dylan factor, I'm also a fan of many of the artists on this new project; Elvis Costello, Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor Goldsmith from Dawes, and Jim James. I can take or leave Mumford & Sons, but the stuff by Marcus Mumford is pretty good too. T-Bone Burnett did a very good job of mixing and matching this crew to Dyan's lyrics, and the resultant songs are very, very strong. I'm particularly impressed with the songs that Costello sang on here, plus I think that Taylor Goldsmith remains a hugely overlooked talent.\n\nThis project may not please every fan of the original \"Basement Tapes\" --- and in many ways it's a much different sort of musical project --- but the spirit is strong and the intentions are good, and you can't fault the musical excellence. This album truly shines.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"My choice for the top male singer-songwriter\/musician pop album of the year.  (I make up my own annual music awards as I can't stand the real ones - such as the Grammy awards - except maybe in the blues and Americana categories.)\n\nThe \"deluxe\" edition, with five \"bonus\" tracks, is the only deal to take here, bringing the total to 17 new and original tracks and over 55 minutes of exceptionally fine music.\n\nThis is the first Chris Isaak CD offering in six years to feature original material, and the question for me upon initial listen was whether or not I would encounter anything of the caliber of \"Blue Hotel,\" \"Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing,\" or \"Wicked Game,\" say.  The answer would seem to be not quite, but \"Reverie\" is an absolute beauty that may be a worthy candidate for fourth place; and then we have \"Perfect Lover\" (as nearly  perfect a Roy Orbison-esque song as he has ever come up with), \"Down in Flames\" (slashing rockabilly that name-checks '50s and '60s celebrities who died young, while extolling a devil-may-care, live-for-today philosophy), \"The Way Things Really Are\" (a country ballad that would have gone top five on the '60s country charts had Merle Haggard & The Strangers recorded it), \"Please Don't Call\" (his toughest song ever about recovering from a mutually destructive romantic relationship), \"Dry Your Eyes\" (a guitar rocker with the huge hook line, \"I hang on because I love you\"), which are all way up there in quality as well; and from the bonus tracks come the stunning \"Some Days Are Harder Than the Rest\" (a big emotive ballad about lost love) and the superbly realized Hank Williams-inspired (I'm guessing) \"Every Night I Miss You More.\"\n\n\"Every Night I Miss You More\" and the title song \"First Come the Night\" point to the general theme here equating getting through the night to getting past heartache.  There is so much here that feels emotionally real, reflective, dark at times, and there are some definite attempts at dramatic crescendos  la Roy Orbison.  But then there is relief in the strictly fun songs where we hear some nods to Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis (\"Don't Break My Heart\" sounds like some sort of whacked-out outtake from the \"Blue Hawaii\" soundtrack sessions!), Rick Nelson and even an early Conway Twitty.  The aforementioned \"Perfect Lover\" is punctuated by lively Mexican-flavored horns, and \"Kiss Me Like a Stranger\" has exotic touches and South-of-the-border-sounding guitars.  And speaking of guitars, Isaak's longtime lead electric guitarist Hershel Yatovitz is sensational in matching all of Isaak's outpourings of emotion and creating that haunting quality that pervades his ballads.\n\nThe straight-up country songs and other country inflections are indicative of so much of this album being recorded in Nashville with a pair of country music producers.  We may be seeing a bit of a future trend here.\n\nBesides the metaphor of getting through the darkness of night, how about this for a simile from the rockin' anti-selfishness number titled \"Insects\":  \"Bad ideas are like insects on the windshield of my mind.\"  There isn't much I can add to that!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on \"Thank You\" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both \"All Around The World\" and \"U Know\" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, \"Vibin'\" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  \"I Sit Away\" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel \"Jezzebel\" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on \"Khilil (Interlude)\" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with \"Trying Times\" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights \"I'll Make Love To You\" and \"Water Runs Dry\".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on \"On Bended Knee\".  \"50 Candles\" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content \"...feels like one of those nights...\"  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on \"Yesterday\" they perform accapella.

{"text":"When it has came down to definitive musicians, there are much fewer and farther between that have made it worth while.. Elton John though has one of those musicians that has made the most brilliant and striking music for nearly 50 years. What he and Bernie Taupin have made musically, has been so dynamic all of this time, it has been 10x much better than a lot of the joke artists that have been on radio today. Still, it is so surprising that many artists that are out there now, don't really have the sincerity that he has had, even when Elton John was still battling his demons. Some of Elton's songs today are so strong, he just doesn't perform them so much. Empty Garden (Hey, Hey Johnny) is one of them that really is so intimate it speaks louder than words. It was written for the loving memory of John Lennon, whom sadly was murdered outside of his home back in 1980. I still love this song today, because it speaks louder than words at the heart, and is very intimate from the soul of the ivories.

It still has proven that there music hasn't been forgotten by the public at all, and this collection of their music is also not forgotten either.\n\nEarth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits is a single disc reflection of the group during their 1970's hey day and all of the tracks that are still just shown as true guilty pleasures today. The songs on this collection still stand out today, and they sound better than they did before on this collection. The album includes classics like their standard Shining Star, the soulful and elequent After The Love Has Gone, Fantasy, the funky & upbeat September, and Let's Groove. They are just delightful to listen to, and still stand out very weel with the essence of Disco, Soul, Funk & R&B.\n\nAlthough it is a shame that the group hasn't captured what they had back in the 70's, but Earth Wind & Fire are still great to listen to today. Their 1998 Greatest Hits is a truly a really definitive record, and I absolutely recommend this a whole lot for anybody who wants to be a shining star.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nRemastering: A\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"I have long been a fan of Ms. Swift's music, and was thrilled to see her achieve such huge success at such a tender age. She is a very talented young lady. However, whether through her own desires to branch out and test her musical abilities, or whether she has been ill-advised to take her pop-country sound all the way to pop to broaden her fan base, this CD full of songs just does not do it for me -- or for her! Best stay with country, Taylor, and let the other pop divas rule the pop music world. If you want to grow musically, you can do that within the country music field by enrichening your depth of music while maturing your lyric writing skills. This CD is a letdown for me, and I am sure, for many of her steadfast fans.","classification":3,"fold":2}
{"text":"Garrison Keillor calls them an old-timey band, and that they are.  It's bittersweet to hear this record and know that their sound will be significantly different from now on.\n\nMy personal favorite is Big Iron World, and this CD is not up to that level.  Carry Me Back focuses more on the sizzling fiddle and less on the soaring harmonies.  However, it's a good time, and there really isn't a weak track in the bunch.\n\nThe title track, Carry Me Back to Virginia, is written from the perspective of a soldier who fought with his brother in the Civil War.  Track 3, Levi, extends the theme by portraying a country boy who fought and died in Iraq.  Although the songs deal with classic tragic themes, the music is lively and inspiring.  In fact, many of the songs here are pretty downbeat if you just focus on the lyrics, but the music lifts you up.\n\nMy favorite song is Country Gal.  It is the lightest in tone and comes out of nowhere with a snippet of Hey Good Lookin' by Hank Williams.  I love songs that you can sing along to the very first time you hear them.\n\nThe songs on this album reward continued listening.  The lyrics are strong.  These boys tell a good story, and each song is really a little party.  The exception would be the final song, Ways of Man, which is more reflective and much quieter.  It's an interesting way to end the album.\n\nMy favorite part of this band are the harmonies.  You can't really get much better than OCMS singing I Hear Them All.  The harmonies here are not as sustained or jubilant.  Still a worthy addition to their canon.  I really hope the group can evolve after the departure of Watson and Younts.  Nobody else really does music the way they do, they have created their own niche.  Mumford and Sons, Trampled by Turtles, Avett Brothers have similar characteristics, but to my mind OCMS inhabits \"old-timey\" like no one else.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Most beginning classical pianists are familiar with Chopin from the easier preludes, waltzes, and nocturnes.  I actually first heard many of these pieces for the first time on a Vox box of LPs which included performances by Novaes, Frankl, Klien and others. I think there were 12 LPs and the records were about a dollar a piece. This box does not duplicate that box but there are many excellent performances here. The recording of the etudes by Simon reveals much of the beauty which is frequently lost when these pieces are just played to show off technique. The box also documents the recordings Simon made for Vox of the Waltzes, Scherzos, Ballades, Sonatas, Impromptus, and the two piano concertos. Simon was born in New York in 1922 and has had a long succeesful career as a performer, teacher, and judge at competitions.  Simon has a reputation as a super virtuoso who is capable of playing with great beauty, long singing lines, and intelligence. It is wonderful to have so much Chopin from this pianist. I wish the box contained a larger sampling of Moravec's Chopin. Moravec's nocturnes recorded for another label rank very highly on many reviewers lists. This box is an excellent introduction to the music of Chopin. If you love romantic music, you should enjoy this box. If you have never studied the keyboard you might even think about giving it a try. Adults can learn to play the piano. While some of this music is meant for virtuosos only there are many of the pieces that can be started with a year or two of lessons. It is a great way to relax and bring beauty to your life.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Believe me, I am not a big fan of the electronic blips and blats that are littered throughout Simple Plan's third full length album. And I also might add that there are no less than 4 ballads on the album (one of which is a transparent re-write of Green Day's \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and the other sounds way too much like the Backstreet Boys' \"More Than That\"). However, there IS a spectacular ballad on the disc, the piano-laden \"I Can Wait Forever.\" Simple Plan is always at its best, though, when it attacks a straightforward rocker, such as \"Time To Say Goodbye\" and the hook-laden \"Take My Hand.\" The boys don't always hit the mark, but they deserve props for not putting out the same album three times in a row....or like so many bands do, soften out completely (like Relient K). There is a good bit of guitar rock here, and far more hooks than other bands in this genre crank out every few years. I give it four stars because at times the sound is intriguing, and other times it is annoying (like on the disasterously embarrasing track \"Generation'), and although the band goes to great lengths to sound different or unique, in some form or another, you have heard all of these songs before.\n\nHere's a run-through of a few selected tracks:\n\nWhen I'm Gone - First single off the album, big hook & chorus, but  kind of slow-paced.\nTake My Hand - The beat sounds exactly like The Bravery's \"Honest Mistake\" but the hook is very catchy.\nGeneration - Wretched synth intro, worse than Europe's \"Final Countdown.\" This track is embarrassing.\nTime To Say Goodbye - Their trademark pop-punk sound.\nI Can Wait Forever - No, this is not a cover of the song by Air Supply. This is actually a great track and the best the band has ever done. Hope you enjoy.","classification":4,"fold":2}
{"text":"CALIFORNIA SOUL, an Ashford & Simpson composition, sung by Marlena Shaw is a treat to the ears! I heard this song a few years back, it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it. I had to find it and add it to my collection. Since then, I've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack, and featured in the movie The Italian Job. From the time the music starts playing, you know you're in for a treat and you get it. The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet. Marlena's voice is on point; it's uniquely powerful and full of soul. She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note. This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is. It's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers (Gang Starr, The Game, etc.), beer manufacturers, Dockers, countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver: San Frisco. I like the album, but I LOVE THIS SONG. You can't listen to it once, you have to play it over and over because it's so good. It's a timeless classic.

{"text":"I've been a fan of the Bee Gees since the 80's.  At that time, they were a 'singles' band, the 'baby Beatles' because of their influence.  After the success of the album 1st, which was more of a compilation of singles, their albums were hit and miss.  So when this album came out, in all it's velvet splendor-it sported a velvet cover, but no single to back it up.  After 45 years, I finally downloaded and listened to it, and there were some songs that could have been singles, although they departed from the 'formula' because they went in a slightly 'country' direction, an idea from one of the non brother members of the band.  Country and symphony, who knew?  The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release\/  They would come back stronger in the 70's, but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins.  The only song that may be familiar is First of May, but the music and lyrics are top notch.  The boys were finding their own voices and style.  But when you consider all the good music coming out in '69-Abbey Road, The who, the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts, this one, probably also because of it's cost' was ignored.  Maybe that's why it's so endearing now, considering that the guys were Justine Beiber and Miley Cyrus's age when they produced this.

I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.\n\nNone the less, pick up this CD to support AZ.

{"text":"I didn't get hooked on this CD at once; probably because I expected a battle (well, the first song has a combative title), but this is a coherent band, using the heritage of both bands up until the moment this recording is made, with Duke and Count giving their respective best personal and organizational contributions.\n\nIt is intriguing to listen to the two pianists collaborate with such a great deal of mutual respect and understanding (with the additional attraction of Billy Strayhorn as Ellington's second pair of hands on \"Take the A Train\", a great Strayhorn's composition). Frank Wess' flute seems to blend naturally with Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet; it is a great fun to hear Cat Anderson and Thad Jones working together and to root for Basie's tenorist Frank Foster as he tries to chase Paul Gonsalves (Ellington's tenor sax road runner) across the highway of \"Jumpin at the Woodside\"...\n\n\"To You\", \"Wild Man\", \"BDB\" and other tunes offer many surprises (although not all the moments are equally impressive), with Quentin Jackson (tb) giving great contributions regardless of the fact that, on this album, he comes from Basie's band, instead of his more natural place with Ellington trombone section...\n\nRay Nance is also here, as well as Johnny Hodges, Lawrence Brown, Willie Cook and many others (including the rhythm guitar of Freddie Green), contributing to this great band that uses some very interesting arrangements for this occasion. Not an Ellington record, or a Basie record, this is a great big band album, although novices to swing music should probably start with somewhat more conventional and less extrovert material...","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"If Eminem were to ask for my advice in regards to making another Marshall Mathers LP, I would've told him not to do it. That album itself is a sequel of sorts to The Slim Shady LP. A part \"2 after all this time; he's released four albums since then; would be, at best, pointless. If he insisted on it, I would've told him it should match the original not just on an aesthetic level, which is subjective, but on a conceptual level. That means about eighteen tracks; a few skits and several songs that have him rapping-up controversy like he did back in 2000 to beats produced by the likes of Dr Dre, Mel-Man and The Bass Brothers. The addition of a 45 King song would be great. If the album isn't the same conceptually, I would've told him, it will be a sequel in title only and that won't make much sense.\n\nI don't personally know Eminem though. Even if I did, he probably wouldn't be seeking for my advice on such an important career move. So here we have it, an album that, as far as I'm concerned, should've never seen the light of day; a light that, despite boarded windows, shines into the old house he grew-up in. That means more bars about being a bullied outcast with a passion for hip-hop. Rapping was not only a normalizer but a popularizer, he suggests, so, even at the age of 41, a song about his mother serves as a sort of psycho-therapy session. The difference is that he now says he loves her, \"because you're my Ma,\" as if merely giving birth to him is (suddenly) reason enough to love her. He says he cringes when he hears Cleaning Out My Closet. I cringe when I hear Headlights.\n\nThis is a sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP, after all, not The Eminem Show or Encore... or Recovery. Yet it sounds more like those (subpar) albums than his third best. Let alone Relapse, which he trashed, and The Slim Shady LP, the best two of only three good albums. With that, his Legacy is tarnished. He's been my favorite popular rapper since 1999, but his skills have generally dropped from excellent to barely good since then; he's more of a rhyme god than a Rap God; and this album is a reflection of that. There are two eight-bar sets on So Far that near prime Eminem, the McDonald's and Kroger bits, and he easily outwits Kendrick Lamar on their Love duet. But Berzerk is trashy, So Much Better isn't much better and the Stan sequel is ruined by a bombastic tack-on verse at the end.\n\nYes, he had the balls to make a Stan sequel. The main beat is the closest we get to a Dr Dre production and the chorus is the best the formulaic guest-list of out-of-place crooners have to offer, but even with a proper ending, it wouldn't come close to the quality of the original. The Canibus take from C True Hollywood Stories is better. The biggest problem with Bad Guy though, in the context of this album, is that it comes at the beginning and is followed by a tracked skit that continues LP 1 not from the end but from the part of Criminal in which Eminem shoots the bank teller. Here history is revised, his getaway driver bails on him and he (Eminem) ends-up shooting and presumably killing himself; a fate that clashes awkwardly with his impeding doom in the trunk of Stan's brother's car.\n\nThere are LP 1 references elsewhere; he finally gets to say what he wanted to say about giving guns to kids at Columbine, uncensored, now that society has forgotten about them; but spotty moments of nostalgia aren't enough to make LP 2 a worthy follow-up. You can hear Ken Kaniff on one of the Deluxe tracks; the Wicked Ways beat is the best of the lot; but he should be on the actual album, with Steve Berman, Paul and a 2013 Public Service Announcement. It would be cool hearing Dina Rae on track 13, but a generic stadium anthem like Survival, with Liz Rodrigues, is not. He should've cut all the part 2 stuff and went with a different title. Then this would've just been another mediocre Eminem album. He hints that it might also be his final album and, at this point, that's okay too.\n\nIt would be a senseless way to go, but his album history has been conceptually senseless ever since he decided to title the first one The Slim Shady LP as if Slim Shady was a one-album character. Now he randomly goes back to not the first but the second LP for one that, aside from its own structure flaws, is filled with songs that have structure flaws. Verses go on too long. I think every verse in a song should be the same length in bars, and those bars should go by eights, unless there's a logical reason for them not to. Choruses are abandoned. If you like the Evil Twin hook but happen to miss it in the middle of the song, well, too bad. Eminem apparently doesn't give a \"beep\" about things like that, which makes him more impressive as a rapper than a song-slash-album artist.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":2}

I love Todd's writing style, and you would almost think his sense of humor or out of the box views on life may get lost in a more rock and roll style band, but he nails it in writing and delivery. The band is great. How could it not be Dave Schools, Neal Casal, Jesse Aycock, Duane Trucks, and Chad Staehly...I mean this is a supergroup..I dunno if I even like that word because most supergroups tend to fall flat..lets saw this is a dream group, at least for the kind of people that enjoy Todd's work.

{"text":"There is no question that Chris Brown has been through a lot in the spotlight. After being labeled as a girl beater from his ordeal with Rihanna for a long while, he has really went through his heartbreak, yet he is making the attempt to go back to square one as a singer. While his last album Grafitti was a huge lemon, he has made slow steps to get back to being recognized as a entertainer. He did hit a nerve with Deuces last year, and now with F.A.M.E. hitting Gold status, it is a slow-welcomed return to Chris as a singer. His latest single, She Ain't You, the second single from F.A.M.E., showcases a tribute to his late idol, Michael Jackson well and with a noble sample of the classic Human Nature. It is honestly better than the wasted samples from Michael's music, including his ex Rihanna's sample of Wanna Be Starting Somethin' a few years ago. While it isn't the best sampled Michael Jackson song, unlike SWV's better take on Human Nature with Right Here almost 20 years ago, it still is better than the 80's wasted-sampled songs that've came out like Lady Gaga's Born This Way, and The Black Eyed Peas The Time this past year. Hopefully, this can be a nice fresh start from Chris, and he can keep finding his way home well. The song is worth a try, and at least a better song than a lot of the lackluster songs from Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez out right now.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"We do not really think of Simon & Garfunkel as being a folk group, mainly because when \"The Sounds of Silence\" became a big hit and a signature song of the 1960s it had been electrified. But when you listen to their first album, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.,\" it becomes clear from the opening track, \"You Can Tell the World,\" that they were a folk duo. Of course there is the obligatory Dylan song, \"The Times They Are-A Changin',\" Sixties songs like \"Last Night I had the Strangest Dream,\" and traditional songs like \"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" to add to the folk song bona fides of the album.\n\nIn retrospect what is interesting is Paul Simon's attempt to write folk songs, a category into which \"The Sounds of Silence\" does not fall. Of those original songs, \"He Was My Brother\" is the one most in keeping with the spirit of the Sixties, while \"Bleecker Street\" evinces the delicate music he could write. But Simon is still learning his craft, as evidenced by \"Sparrow,\" which tends to be a bit pretentious. Then there is Simon & Garfunkle's rendition of the traditional song \"Benedictus,\" which gets a bit electrified as well. There is a real sense that the duo are still learning their craft and just beginning to find the sound that would define them.\n\nIn addition to be digitally remastered, this version of \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. includes a trio of bonus tracks, which consist of bare boned demo version of Simon's \"Bleecker Street\" and alternate takes of his \"He Was My Brother\" and the cover of \"The Sun is Burning.\" But even with those additions this remains an interesting but not great debut album by a duo that would continue to improve with each and every album they put out until they reached the pinnacle with \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and then called it quits when they were literally on top of the music world.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I got turned on to The Pretty Reckless by accident. I was looking for something new to listen to and I saw this album advertised and gave \"Heaven Knows\" a sample track a listen, and took a chance and bought it. I think for what is out there today being played on the radio Endlessly, this album is a courageous Effort. I have two teenage daughters, one likes Gaga, which is Fine, one likes Skillet, Linkin Park etc. Both liked the album. The best part of it to me are Taylor Momsen's vocals and the overall Sound of the band. Its one thing to release an imitation of a rock album and another to pour yourself into it. I feel that in the songs on this release. Best song? Hard to say, for me there are a Few...House on a Hill, the title track and \"Heaven Knows\". Its a pleasure for me to buy \"new music\" and hear something I can play loudly in my car\"Joyfully\". I like LOUD, pounding Rock music....not the thumping of Drums to a hip hop beat.....ROCK! The Pretty Reckless aren't among the Classics, but they give you some hope about the present state of music.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Tracks like \"I Love You for Psychological Reasons\" and \"Say Nice Things About Detroit\" continue the duo's tradition of bizarre yet humorous lyrics and catchy melodies. We're also treated to their stunning cover of \"Bills Bills Bills\", the popular Destiny's Child song that drove me crazy back in the 90's. Here they've made it not only listenable but insanely fun. However, it's \"Shape Shifter\" that makes the album for me. It's a classic slice of TMBG with an earworm melody and wonderfully irreverent lyrics. This album is worth it just for that tune alone.\n\nThis is a fine collection and one that should please fans both old and new.

{"text":"Woman To Man would've been a more sensible title because most of these songs are addressed to (\"you\"-to) a man. These are the men Keyshia Cole is or was romantically involved with since her last album. That's assuming she's portraying herself as a straight (heterosexual) woman. If she's bisexual, then only some of the songs are addressed to men, matters are made all the more complicated and the album title still doesn't make sense. Of course, careless concepts are only part of the problem. The biggest flaw is the abundance of lackluster vocal melodies. The lady has a strong singing voice, but her apparent lack of talent when it comes to composing melodies has her wasting it on \"love\" songs that are more insipid than inspirational.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":2}

Included is a great cross section of seminal works.  Having all the movements in their correct order provides a more fluid listening experience than other collections.  And yet the cross section of music also provides a pleasing variety, from concerti to symphonies and everything in between.\n\nThe collection kicks off with the instantly recognizable Allegro from \"Eine klein Nachtmusik.\"  And it closes with the lovely Motet in D Major for choir and orchestra.  But throughout, it provides a good balance of works.\n\nWhile all of these works are well known, some of the included movements are seldom given the same level of attention as their more recognizable movements.  For example, Concerto Number 21 in C Major (5-7) is best known from the second \"Andante\" movement (\"Elvira Madigan\").  But the first movement is often excluded on classical compilations.  It's wonderfully performed and recorded here, with energetic piano solos interspersed throughout the orchestral sections.\n\nA nice variety of concertos are included for a variety of instruments.  I am partial to piano solos.  Personal favorites include the \"Facile\" Sonata Number 16 (62-65), Concerto Number 20 for Piano & Orchestra (50 - 52) and the \"Turkish March\" Sonata (11-13).  But there are plenty of works to appeal to a wide range of classical music listeners.\n\nI am sure there will be some who could argue over the inclusion of some works and the exclusion of others.  But given the size of Mozart's canon, that is to be expected.  This is a very nice cross section of music, regardless.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is quality music, performed by some great musicians, organized as complete works, and provided at a tremendous value.  There's not much else that one could want from such a collection.  This collection will provide you with hours of listening enjoyment.  It has helped me enjoy an early work day, and I highly recommend it to you.\n\nEnjoy.","classification":5,"fold":2}

The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!

I almost would bet Barbra Streisand or Donna Summer could streak back to the top of the charts if either of them can book herself a duet with the former N'Sync icon.  And heck, it does have a great beat, its suggestive without being profane, and is a fun song to dance if I were still young enough. With that said. . .I am glad I grabbed it a week ago for 99 cents.  I would not touch this song--it simply isn't good enough or must have--for the inflated price of $1.29.  That also pretty much explains why CD's always debut at #1 but never stay long.

{"text":"The Killers return with their sophomore set, \"Sam's Town\". This time out, they emerge more confident and with a harder guitar-driven edge. The synths are still here, but they're pushed to the back, or utilized to help the melodies along. There are plenty of hit singles here such as their first, \"When You Were Young\" with its U2-like chorus and guitar flourishes. The title track is a mix of Duran Duran and Rush while \"Bling (Confession Of A King)\" and \"For Reasons Unkown\" emphasize the tougher guitars while maintaining a delicate balance of synths. \"Read My Mind\" would be my choice for second single. The band hits a few speed bumps along the way during the second half of the disc with \"Uncle Jonny\" and \"My List\", but this is more than compensated for with other good songs \"Bones\", \"This River Is Wild\" and \"Why Do I Keep Counting?\".\n\nThe Killers avoid the sophomore slump issue and show that they are here to stay. Strong melodies, rocking guitars and intelligent\/poetic lyrics keep \"Sam's Town\" a cut above other releases of 2006.","classification":4,"fold":2}

This debut album,  originally issued on Bill Graham's small San Francisco label, and out of  print for many years, nailed it all on the first try. The songs are  eminently catchy, the rhythms (especially Dave Garibaldi's drumming) are as  vital as heartbeats, and the horn charts blew away their contemporaries.  The vocals, always a moving target with T.O.P. came from Richard Thomas and  Rufus Miller. Many fans like their next two or three LPs better, as the  arrangements became more refined and the band tightened up a bit, but as  the founding document of funk city, I'll vote this one every time.

It was one thing for Rihanna to come out a lackluster song, but honestly Rihanna and Britney do not even have any chemistry together at all. It was one thing when Britney did Me Against The Music with Madonna 8 years ago and for Rihanna to score with What's My Name for casual fans, but this is definitely a step into the wrong direction.

{"text":"Remember when Brit pop was the flavor of the month? Oasis, Spice Girls, all seemingly ruled the world. Well, now it's trying to make a comeback with Leona Lewis, and former HillSong singer and song-writer, little Natasha Bedingfield.\n\nThis time, she doesn't bring any phony rap artists, but rather, herself and a backup singer. The result is distinctively Brit Pop, but maybe a little more suited to today's audiences. The vocals are the same as always for Bedingfield. The music itself is typical modern music, take it or leave it, although my description is a bit vague. The song is minorly catchy, but pretty much standard Brit Pop stuff that is overly forgettable.\n\nOverall, forgettable, Brit Pop, standard, maybe a bit boring.

{"text":"Few artists lasting from the sixties have refused to put out numerous greatest hits packages (including, Rolling Stone, Moody Blues, Bee Gees, King Crimson, and more) and Bowie seems to have satisfied his fans with an abundance of greatest hits and box sets.  Expensive and daunting, these sets are a marketers wet dream and sometimes a fan.  With so much of Bowie available in all forms and formats, its nice to have a fairly concise package of his singles.  In Bowie innovative fashion, this set goes in reverse, which somehow brings a fresh listen to the songs.\n\nLike every great hits package, there has to be new material and Bowie provides well with the new, Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime), a jazzy complex single.  Disc number one covers all the singles to Hearts Filthy Lesson with Shadow Man making a nice comeback.  .  Disc two hits the biggest hits, but misses several.  These include, Never Let Me down, Day-In, Day-Out, Underground, White Light, White Heat, Up The Hill backwards, DJ, Alabama Song, Look back In Anger and Beauty And The Beast.  Granted, there is a time limit to each CD, but a fourth CD would only be a marketing problem.\nDisc three misses a few classic singles like, Rock And Roll Suicide, 1984, John, Im Only Dancing (UK Single) and the unforgivable omission of the classic, Suffragette City.  However, there are some welcome album cuts, like The man Who Sold The World and sixties unknowns, Do Anything You Say, I Dig Everything, Rubber Band, Thee Laughing Gnome and Love you Till Tuesday.  The last four singles (technically the first four) are a great addition as well, starting with Liza Jane.\n\nMany of the singles are radio edits, which is fine considering time restraints, but a fourth CD including all the singles would have been very nice.  However, the liner notes are generous in giving enough information about each song, (writer, album, credits, etc.).  This set is keeping me happy with all the albums I already have, but I am looking forward to the day when Bowie releases all his albums with all the outtakes and unreleased material I none gigantic box set  remastered with all the liner notes one could dream for.  Until then, the giant box sets and this greatest hits package will do just fine.  And thank you for providing well-built jewel cases.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"John Mayer's public mea culpa comes musically, a whispered plea for understanding after some serious public bumbling of his life. Who knew that, when his musical world finally had a collision with the paparazzi word, it would humble the guy into making the stellar music of \"Born and Raised\"?  It's the first album he's made where what used to be affectations towards the singer-songwriters of the 70's that John's long been enamored by become genuinely personal and effective.\n\nYou can't blame the man for wanting to make something other than knock offs of his heroes. He may have been extremely good at doing just that, but now he wants to be the man who - as he states in the song \"Queen of California\" - finds the \"sun that Neil Young Hung after the gold rush of '71.\" The pallet he is drawing from is serious CSN&Y and James Taylor turf, yet now he sounds less like he's rubbing shoulders with them and more like he's proving he can make music that spiritually accentuates his forebears. Those public slaggings have obviously made him want to try harder, and left their stings. \"Now the cover of Rolling Stone ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone,\" he realizes in \"Speak for Me.\"\n\n\"Born and Raised\" also chucks aside any attempt at overproduction (no loudness wars here) for a spartan acoustic setting. \"Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey\" begs for quiet in a life that was filled with too much background noise, along with a great harmonica riff. Same with \"If I Ever Get Around to Living,\" as blatant a confirmation that trials by fire are something that need to be part of the past. The bulk of the album is spent in these contemplative moments, and it all rings true. It's not only Mayer's personal best, it maybe one of 2012's classiest albums.","classification":5,"fold":2}

The track \"Feds in Town\" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. \"Super Tight...\" is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue.

{"text":"It is honestly so tragic whenever someone young and talented dies at a early age in life, you sometime want to cry with the deepest heart. That is what has happened with the tragic death of George Michael, whom died on December 25th, 2016 at the somber young age of 53 years old. He was a absolute gift in the soul of the heart with his work. He had crafted some of the most beautiful ballads of the past 35 years of music. When he was with Wham!, he had brilliant pop songs that were guilty pleasures, and when he was starting to be on his own, he made the deepest statement from any breakthrough as a singer with Faith. One of my favorite songs from Faith that had been more underrated, but deep at the heart, is Kissing A Fool. He really began to take a deeper heart when he stepped away from Wham!. It just is a delightful gem that really hits you when you really hear the song from the beginning. While everyone had been more focused on I Want Your Sex & One More Try, I was focused here from the start. If you have never heard a song of George's, this one would be a loving memory to start with.\n\nGeorge Michael: 1053-2016\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"The best of what redeemed the eighties from MTV crap. This was and still is a dense cacophony of beauty and your classic 80s angst and cynicism with moments of tentative redemption. Everyone's got their favorite 80s icons- they're probably mine because I got to see them in a small venue at the height of their powers, just after this had come out. Nothing burns into your teenage brain permanently like a great rock group when they're on top of their game, before they're just paying the bills and trying not to punch each other out in the process.\n\n\"She is Mine\" is a standout; Butler's seething rasp can have its oddly tender moments. (I still think he's one of the all-time sexiest vocalists- and I just die when he talk-sings \"Ha Ha Ha\". Classic Butler-ism.). While \"Pretty In Pink\" tends to give me the Mollyringwalds and it seems a bit sexist, I still love it for what it reminds me of: that great p-furs signature intro.\n\n\"Into you like a train\" is just full-speed searing beauty, guitars sweeping around you. And \"No Tears\" perfectly captures 80s wariness of political activism and the ensuing apathy \/antagonism with the problematic radicals of the day (\"There's demonstrations, and demonstrations.... you don't have a point of view. You don't have to say you do\".\n\nWhile occasionally Butler has his Dylan-ish moments of lyrical nonsense, they do work in their 80s way, like a collage of imagery and emotional impressions, not literal straightforward meanings in lyrics.\n\nIt has a  melodic, yet driving, layered noise. I could never go full atonal - the No Wave thing, so this has that kind of energy, in a sense, yet is tight and has a sense of tune you can remember, as opposed to just tuneless screeching. The layers & textures never get in the way of the lyrical\/melodic line- it always sounds like it's just short of all parts crashing together, yet it's sort of a controlled chaos that sweeps past you and around you. Also, this album has density without all the twinkly, trebly production that \"Forever Now\" has to make it more radio-friendly.\n\nPlus this just brings out the adolescent clove-smoker in me, when all this stuff seemed so romantic! \"So run Down\" is another great track- reminds me of that teenage time when even a bad hangover seemed like a new adventure!\n\nBetween the Furs & the Bunnymen, it was all shades and trenchcoats here on out...and that wasn't such as a bad thing at a tender age.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"Houston-born singer\/songwriter\/guitarist Vince Converse began his musical career while still a sophomore in high school. He and his band, Sunset Heights, played blues-inflected rock in venues that he was still too young to patronize, appeared on international TV, and toured with acts like Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Johnny Winter, Peter Green, and Fats Domino. After playing with the group for seven years, Converse struck out on his own, moved to South Dakota, and released a solo album, 1999's Nineteen Fifteen, named after the birth year of Muddy Waters.\"\n\n\"One Step Ahead\" contains six written or co-written Converse songs and a couple of fine covers including Lowell Fulson's \"Sleeper,\" whom the album is dedicated to, Riley \"B.B.\" King's \"Recession Blues,\" Edgar Winter's \"Give It Everything You've Got\" and a wonderful version of Willie Dixon's \"I Ain't Superstitious.\"\n\nJoining Converse on the 1999 Mystic Music release is drummer Damon Duwhite, bassist Ken Rich, horn players Arno Hecht and Larry Etkin, guitarist Hugh Pool, keyboardist Jason Ladanye, background singers Bill Sims and Toby Rose and percussionists Eddie Kramer and Geraldo Valdez\"....by Matt Alcott Review date: December 1999\n\nA smooth artist, reminds me of Buddy Whittington of the Bluesbreakers, now gone solo artist.

{"text":"Jon Mayer's voice at times can sound a little bit like that of the young Paul Simon, but neither his songwriting skills nor his melodic inspiration can rise consistently to that level.  That said, however, this is an unpretentious and workmanlike album, supported by a fine group of back-up people (I recognize Chuck Leavell on keyboards from a Greg Allman album I heard recently), and well-produced sonically by Don Was.  It has a kind of melancholy, slightly self-absorbed vibe that, again recalls some aspects of the young Simon, but the songs are literate and don't outstay their welcome.  All that sounds a little bit like damning with faint praise, but some of the songs are memorable -- \"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\" and \"A Face to Call Home\" are very good, and even better to my ears are \"Queen of California\" and \"Something like Olivia\" -- the latter is a lilting or soft-rocking blues that I'll probably remember when most of the rest of the album fades from memory.  I should add that I know nothing about Mayer, nor am I particularly interested in finding out: I bought it for under $5.00, mainly because it was under $5.00, so I listened without preconceptions or expectations.","classification":4,"fold":2}

I realize that good songs have low parts and high parts, which this one does, but the melody is so ordinary that if it wasn't Adam singing, NOBODY would be taking notice of this tune.\n\nAnd that's the only thing that saves it...those ordinary lines come to life with Adam's singing, and this will undoubtedly become a contender for more than one award. But for me, the song doesn't offer much, and it sounds like the type of song that will become very old, very fast (which is not Adam's fault at all).\n\nWe'll be hearing much better from Adam in the future.

{"text":"All Swans' previous styles find a home on this opus magnum constructed around the three long pieces A Piece of the Sky, The Apostate and The Seer. The addition of accordion, bells, clarinet, hammer dulcimer, orchestral bells, vibraphone and \"hand-made violin thing\" bring nuance and depth to the music.\n\nAs early as the late 1980s\/early 1990s albums like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Children-of-God\/dp\/B000008LB7\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Children of God<\/a>&nbsp;and White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, Michael Gira's talent as a modern classical composer was evident. Later works like Soundtracks For The Blind and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Die-Tr-ist-Zu\/dp\/B000000SVM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Die Tr ist Zu<\/a>&nbsp;with tracks like Ligeti's Breath\/Hilflos Kind, confirmed it.\n\nThe Seer's centrepiece, the title track, recalls the Swans-related Body Lovers project of 1998 titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Number-One-of-Three\/dp\/B0000060P7\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Number One of Three<\/a>, a 73-minute journey through alternately spooky, soothing, soulful, depressing, uplifting, disturbing and inspiring soundscapes. Symphonic swirls alternate with industrial beats and certain movements encompass disparate elements like drones that are followed by typical rock instruments that in turn make way for solos.\n\nThe Seer has much, much more in the form of bagpipes, chants, chimes, chorales, churncore, harmonica, horns, glockenspiel, gongs, fractured vocals, industrial drones and thuds, a wealth of percussion, ragas and searing guitar riffs. \"I see it all\" Gira intones throughout most of the shifting textures. After about 15 minutes, a manic drum pattern takes the spotlight until it fades as the mournful wails of what sounds like the \"hand-made violin thing\" and similar instruments change the tone and tempo again. Gira's proper singing starts after 28 minutes, concluding this incredible track in an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Angels-of-Light\/dp\/B00005AVFD\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Angels of Light<\/a>&nbsp;mood.\n\nThe Seer Returns has repetitive marching beats behind Gira's sung and chanted vocals but it's Jarboe's voice collages that add a further dimension to the song. They resemble her work on Dark Consort, the collaborative album with Cedric Victor. The spectre of Arnold Schnberg haunts 93rd Ave Blues with high pitched squeals, violent crashes and zombie-like vocal exclamations. There is a resemblance to Schnberg's work as he moved into serialist music, specifically Six Lieder Opus III. When this psychotic chamber music has dissolved into utter cacophony, it is displaced by a power drone.\n\nBehold! Angels of Light appear again on the short mid-tempo song The Daughter Brings The Water but a stranger angel inspires Song For a Warrior. The anima of Swans emerges in a fragile, melodious ballad sung  by Karen O whose delivery of the oblique lyrics remain true to Jarboe's eerie contributions on various&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/World-of-Skin\/dp\/B000WBBH54\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">World of Skin<\/a>&nbsp;and Swans albums.\n\nBells and percussion bookmark Gira's observations on Avatar of the performer as a medium. Avatar's intensity is taken to extremes on The Apostate, a magnificent piece of propulsive rock with guitars that howl and swirl, shattering cymbals, mesmerising bass riffs, thunderous drums and ululations that brutalise and uplift the soul at the same time.\n\nThe crackling fire that brings Piece of the Sky is followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Jarboe\/dp\/B000784X0S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jarboe<\/a>'s hypnotic chorale that descends from soprano to alto\/contralto and even further down when Gira's voice comes in. In the background, occasional muffled moans embellish a persistent polyphonic drone. Then a joyful burst of stringed instruments come to the fore and fade away under the undulating textures of a raga. A segment of tuneful folk with poetic lyrics brings Piece of the Sky to a close.\n\nThe Seer resembles&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Soundtracks-for-the-Blind\/dp\/B00005OAJR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Soundtracks for the Blind<\/a>&nbsp;in the rare occurrence of lyrics so the music is the messenger of many moods. Swans' intensity haunts the harsh and humble moments, the dirge and the dance alike. That is their magic which was spread rather thin on the previous album. The Seer offers it in many enigmatic tones and hues.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"\"That girl took that song away from me.\" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song \"Respect\" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul\/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.\n\nWhen the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself \"Who is that?\" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. \"(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay\" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic.","classification":5,"fold":2}

There are only about 5 songs on this album that are truly good and the rest is filler.\n\nI think that it is kinda of a joke to put this album on all time best lists. It's so obvious that the only reason this album is considered a great album is because Cobain was a drug addict and killed himself. While  I do consider him a good stylist and lyricist, this album does not merit any special attention.\n\nShame on you Rolling Stone magazine.

{"text":"Although Lucinda Williams has been doing her thing for almost thirty years, it seems that she didn't really get a WHOLE lot of attention until she released Car Wheels on a Gravel Road in 1998. That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it, which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album, West.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep. But it really IS very accessible.\n\nLucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like \"Are You Alright\", \"Learning How to Live\" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in \"Mama You Sweet\" and especially \"Fancy Funeral\". But my favorite song would probably have to be \"Words\".\n\nWhile I can do without \"Come On\" and the nine-minute spoken word \"Wrap My Head Around That\", the rest of the album is quality Lucinda. It might not be her best album, but it's far above-average, so if you want to find exceptional music, go west.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4,"fold":2}

True this song is from the sound track of a disaster film, but that's not what comes to mind when you listen to the lyrics and the beautiful way that ADAM sings them.  Knowing the back story of the song makes everything so much more bittersweet and impending chaos completely disappears as the words say what the writer conveys as she lays dying.  Only ADAM can sing this song the way it was meant to be sung and I feel he'll sing it many different ways before he is through as he has done with so many other songs.

{"text":"The past several years have been more about Beyonce' than any of the other divas. But also, it has been more about her overexposure in the music industry. But also it has been more about things internally that also have hurt her in her personal life. One of them is that her husband Jay-Z cheating on her, and having a child out of wedlock. That same feeling also was said about her father Matthew Knowles that had cheated on her mom Tina, and caused that marriage to end in a abrupt and un-amicable divorce. Honestly, when I had heard Beyonce' Knowles make her album Lemonade, I honestly would have to say not on;y was I unimpressed with her album, but I again felt she really had been lagging in musicality in the way she used to have it when she was a part of Destiny's Child. When I heard her song, Daddy Lessons, I thought it was very interesting to hear her try her hands into a country song with her over-branding in R&B. Well, it has worked for divas like The Pointer Sisters that were the first girl group to perform at The Grand Old Opry. At least it is one of her better songs that she had done in years, but not as good as songs like Listen or Halo were. Still, it is a interesting twist in her career, but not really one that has more of a definitive appeal. Hopefully, she will learn to have better in her voice than what she has had before. Honestly, Hymn For The Weekend with Coldplay is her best song this year, and not from her record Lemonade.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":2}

A two-part acoustic\/electric guitar showpiece, the song is a reflection on perceiving reality and the certainty of having to pay a price for treachery and evil.\n\nThe futuristic synthesizer intro is augmented\/contrasted by Joe's bluesy electric and haunting acoustic slide guitars.

Slow blues from the dark realm of another universe.\n\n Minor and major seventh chords complement Joe singing the murky philosophical lyrics of the first, and slower, half of the song.\n\nThe second half of the song features a ferocious electric guitar solo and one of Joe's most compelling vocal performances.\n\nThe Confessor:\n\nIf you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well\nWhat you see is only on the surface\nWhen you try to see the meaning hidden underneath\nThe measure of the depth can be deceiving\nThe bottom has a rocky reputation\n\nYou can feel it in the distance the deeper that you stare\nFrom up above it's hard to see but you know when you're there\nOn the bottom words are shallow\nOn the surface talk is cheap\nYou can only judge the distance by the company you keep\nIn the eyes of The Confessor\n\nIn the eyes of The Confessor\nThere's nowhere you can hide\nYou can't hide from the eyes (of The Confessor)\nDon't you even try\n\nIn the eyes of The Confessor\nYou can't tell a lie\nYou cannot tell a lie (to The Confessor)\nStrip you down to size\n\nNaked as the day that you were born\nNaked as the day that you were born\n\nTake all the trauma, drama, comments\nThe guilt and doubt and shame\nThe what if's and if only's\nThe shackles and the chains\nThe violence and aggression\nThe pettiness and scorn\nThe jealousy and hatred\nThe tempest and discord...\n\nAND GIVE IT UP!","classification":5,"fold":2}

Positive, church inspired, funk music with blistering jam band talent.

{"text":"This is a very fine Richard Thompson album.  The man's a genius who has been writing great songs and playing superb music for decades now and this is a great addition to his already stellar canon.\n\nThompson's music is it's usual excellent self: good melodies, harmonically interesting and lyrically full of that carefree joi de vivre that always characterises Thompson's songs.  :o)  Seriously, a glance at the titles will give you a pretty strong clue that he's not deviating much from the sadness and anger which runs through so much of his work:  Broken Doll; No Peace, No End; Where's Your Heart...you get the idea.  And yet it never becomes depressing or over-bitter.  The quality of the songwriting keeps it well above that level, and it's a fine album.\n\nThe performances and production are top-class, I think.  Thompson is one of the great guitarists of our age and he's on fine form here - some fine guitar work while being quite understated and often quite far back in the mix.  This works very well indeed, I think, and the band are all excellent.\n\nI loved Electric but I wasn't quite so taken with Acoustic Classics, although I can't quite put my finger on why.  This is Thompson back to the peak of his form, I think: a classic Thompson album of fine songs, exceptionally well performed.  It's always hard to tell for a while whether an album will turn out to be truly great as opposed to very good, but I think this may well be up there with Richard Thompson's very best - which is really saying something.  Warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":2}

'Miami Pop Festival' was recorded on March 18, 1970 at Gulfstream Park in Hollandale, Florida. Show is relatively short - running at about forty-five minutes but it's all (still) good. Couldn't get enough of the ass-kicking  \"Hey Joe\", the timeless \"Foxey Lady\", one of my personal all-time Hendrix favorites \"Fire\", the rocking \"Red House\" and the eight-minute jamming \"Purple Haze\". After that - you get two cuts from the gig's afternoon show - a repeat of \"Fire\" and \"Foxey Lady\".

Modern instruments and often a larger orchestra than one hears now on critically blessed recordings.\n\nThe Woldike set of the \"London\" symphonies is very enjoyable but note that you only get ##99 - 104.  I assume that the first set ##93 - 98\" were not recorded by Vanguard.

{"text":"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60's. Much of it heavily based in fact. Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city. But there were some important hybrids too. For Frisco it was Santana. For Oakland it was Tower Of Power. A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk. Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time,they had an approch that couldn't be more different if it tried.\n\n  Right off the bat the album kicks off with \"Knock Yourself Out\". This along with the witty \"Social Lubrication\" and \"The Price\",\"Back On The Streets Again\" and \"The Skunk,The Goose And The Fly\",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick. The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.\n\n  The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer \"Sparkling In The Sand\". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going. It's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened. This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era. And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called \"united funk\".","classification":5,"fold":2}

Karen O didn't impress me in The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, but here I feel like she's found her calling.  Trent Reznor (the man behind Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Ross have taken the original Immigrant Song's instrumental parts and given them a dark electro-beat that is slightly faster, and yet still holds all the intensity of Zeppelin's original.\n\nThe original Immigrant Song is legendary.  It is an amazing fusion of the best attributes of Led Zeppelin.  While I don't know if this cover will stand the test of time, what I do know is that my fandom has been appeased, and my ears keep asking me to give this song another replay.

There was a touch of folk to their songs (with both men meeting in Texas, not too far off) and they made one of the best Todd Rundgren covers ever (\"Love Is The Answer\"). The other four songs are beautifully harmonized top tens from the late 70's, and to this day \"Nights Are Forever\" and \"I'd Really Love To See You Tonight\" hold a certain simple innocence.\n\nI read today that Dan Seals has passed.

{"text":"Nicki Minaj lays the smack down again -- showing more character, personality, and solid identity within a single verse WITHOUT EVEN TRYING than most rappers show in an entire album. Nicky is something ELSE, man. She's so good at what she does that... hell, it ain't even FAIR, man. It just ain't even FAIR.\n\nIncredibly, this song was actually held back as a bonus track on Pink Friday -- and I don't know what actually happened here: 1. the song was either a throw-away that somehow found traction with Nicki's audience, or 2. more likely, an intentional decision was made to keep an obvious monster single hidden (available only as a bonus) to push the album organically after the first push at radio stalled (which they ALL do, eventually). MOMENT 4 LIFE was, indeed, the correct choice for lead-off single (the first 2 singles were \"preceeders,\" which means that they came out before the album, making MOMENT 4 LIFE the actual lead-off), but the idea of using a bonus track as a \"follow\" at radio is -- as far as I know, anyways -- untried (especially with so many radio-friendly units still left on Pink Friday remaining to break at radio!). My personal belief is that the label did this on purpose; notice that the video was already done. (!) That's a reveal, folks. That shows the cards. It's an interesting way to push a record, and it's especially risky for a new artist. They probably did it on purpose, too. That's BRILLIANT.\n\nMarketing effort aside now, the track itself has Nicki flexing, goofing, and gear-shifting comfortably in double-time, interspersing the brilliant verses with a much slower chorus -- both of which are massively commercial. I almost feel like the versus are more hooky than the chorii. (!) No question this is a stand-out track; you KNOW this is Nicky from the first moment you hear the voice -- and what's especially good about this record is that you KNOW you're listening to a unique voice, even if you haven't yet heard Nicki's stuff before. A girl I work with actually stopped speaking in mid-sentence when this song came on the radio, and, pointing at the dashboard, she asked me: \"Who IS this?\"\n\nThat's all that needs to be said.\n\nIt's massive, alright.\n\n5 stars for the title, and 6 stars for the brilliant idea of using a bonus track as a follow at radio.\n\nHeh.\n\nWhoever thunk-up that idea deserves a big fat bonus.\n\nAn exceptional unit, with everything here being done by people who know EXACTLY what they are doing.\n\nMassive.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Vesta is in excellent form, vocally, on this CD and most of the songs are truly emotional and heartfelt. In a certain way, this CD compares very much favorably to her 1998-issued CD \"Relationships\" in the sense that you hear an older, wiser and more mature Vesta singing about life's ups and downs and also about romantic relationships. Had Vesta lived to be able to see this CD released and had she been able to promote it via live performances it would probably have helped to rejuvenate her career as most of the songs would have fit perfectly onto the playlists of Smooth Jazz and Urban Adult Contemporary stations. In any event, it is all too obvious that Vesta literally poured her heart, soul and spirit into the making of this CD and it remains a fitting tribute to one of the best but most underrated R&B Divas of our time.

Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","classification":5,"fold":2}

The musicianship of the players is first rate.  The songs are distinctive.  For example, \"Gliding\" is a lovely track that starts out wistfully and reflective and then changes into a lighthearted piece filled with exhilaration and a sense of freedom -- as if one were gliding over the earth.  Perhaps a companion piece to that track is \"Running On Joy\" which has lighthearted piano trills with Heather Rankin's wispy vocals and will Ackerman giving an underlying buzz on the Australian didgeridoo.  \"Antarctica\" has a stately classical feeling.  \"Naked Love\" is a bittersweet melodic track with Rebecca Daniel's gorgeous violin sending the track into the stratosphere.  Fiona Joy Hawkins has done a masterful job on letting the music take us to different moods and planes.  The cover photograph by Andy Wilson and the artwork by Warren Scott that turns a glacier into a piano keyboard sets a stark but inventive tone for this excellent disc.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.\n\nReleased in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.\n\nThere is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.\n\nThis is one of those singer\/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.\n\nTo make a singer\/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.\n\nJohn Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.\n\nIt also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.\n\nThe album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.\n\nBut, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.\n\nThe worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.\n\nIf you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.","classification":2,"fold":2}

But when I listened to the sample here, I was ready to write that this was the original song. Only after listening to the full-length song could I tell for certain that this is just a really good recreation.\n\nThe lead vocal is an almost perfect match for the original, and the harmonies sound just the same. The instrumentation is a little different at the 2:10 mark, but most of it is spot on.\n\nSince the 1977 version of this song rose to #4 on Billboard and launched the band into at least five years of top-40 hits, it's safe to say that it's pretty good, in a classic rock way. If you liked the original, you'll like this too.","classification":5,"fold":2}

The song is quiet and smooth, much like Sheeran's voice.  \"Small Bump\" isn't concerned with making big noises, showy flourishes, or overwrought vocals.  Instead, the song is content with staying midtempo and calm -- this restraint pays off in a big way.  When Sheeran could bust into a wail, he settles with a whisper.  It's very relaxing, and I think plenty of pop-centric listeners will love the song.\n\nListeners who enjoy this song are encouraged to try out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/dp\/B0081FO2Q4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">+<\/a>, as \"Small Bump\" is representative of what the album has to offer.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"The Good\n\nThere's not much to say about this release really. For the most part Springfield stays true to the original arrangements of the songs, albeit for a different guitar or piano tone here and there. With the songs I recognize, \"I'm Not in Love,\" \"Life in a Northern Town,\" \"Broken Wings,\" \"Baker Street,\" \"Waiting for a Girl Like You,\" \"For No On,\" and \"Imagine,\" they sound just like the originals versions, except their being sung by Rick Springfield. All of the tracks chosen are mellow and flow nicely together. Rick is in great voice, but doesn't really challenge himself.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIt doesn't really make sense to include a new song (\"Cry\") on a covers album, but at least it fits in with the rest. I would have liked to have heard a couple of slightly different versions or arrangements.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI know I've been a little critical of this album, but overall I like it. They're songs I know, from an artist I enjoy. The best thing about Rick Springfield staying true to the originals is that there's no room to mess them up, which happens sometimes with covers albums.","classification":4,"fold":2}

Honestly when it has came to all the music from her surprise 5th album, she really had wasted a lot of peoples' time on the ears, and absolutely from the heart. I really found the music to be very tiresome, and unfortunately lagged a lot from her own heart. I found a lot of the collaborations from Drunk In Love, and Blow to be wasted. Superpower is another song that feels a bit more shady in her voice. She & Frank Ocean have absolutely no chemistry and just lags from her own drive. I really found the song to be one of her weakest songs from the album, and definitely not worth listening to. Frank has a little better work alone, but it definitely is not worth downloading the song alone. I think people have been so caught up in Drunk In Love, that this one was \"superpowered\" to a loss.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.\n\nThe opening song \"Fight Fire With Fire\" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James (\"take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will\", sounds nice doesn't it?). \"Fade to Black\" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day.\"Trapped Under Ice\", \"Escape\" and \"Creeping Death\" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live.\"The Call of Ktulu\" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.\n\nRide The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental \"The Call of Ktulu\". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.\n\nSome prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this \"Ride\" years later. 5\/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"Simply Irresistible\" is a great feel good type of musical track that is my overall favorite by Robert Palmer. In \"Simply Irresistible\" Robert sings a great tune on how a woman that use to just look good to him has gotten even more beautiful and appealing to him over the years. I love it when he sings the lyrics \"she is anything but typical\", and the lyrics \"she's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force\". I personally have learned ways to increase my self-love, and listening to this song is one of the ways I love to do this. I say this because listening to this song helps serve as a fun reminder on why it is important to see the beauty inside of yourself regardless of what is reflected in the outside world. Hearing this song serves as a playful reminder to always work on feeling good from within. \"Simply Irresistible\" is a great song that is like fine wine that gets better with time (just like his other track \"Addicted to Love\"). You are going to love listening to this song if you enjoy Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\" musical track and\/or classic rock and 80's music.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Both of those tapes were consistently plugged into my car's deck back then.  I have since been able to obtain that early Anvil stuff on CD and I still love it.\n\nSo I picked this new one up partly because that documentary The Story of Anvil was awesome!

The CD cover is blah, but the music is what matters.  I am not going to be overly critical of the music like some people have been because bottom line this is rock 'n roll, it has passion, and some great riffing, and it is Anvil and they are BACK.

{"text":"Let's get this out of the way real quick- the Court Yard Hounds are not a new group. They are a side project that is a spinoff of the Dixie Chicks. The story is that the sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire had an album's worth of material for a new Dixie Chicks album. The only problem was that the lead singer Natalie Maines wasn't exactly ready to go back into the studio. So, rather than let the songs sit around and collect dust, the sisters took it upon themselves to record an album, and the end result is the self-titled debut of the Court Yard Hounds.\n\nThis album, unlike their previous albums with the Dixie Chicks, leans more toward an alt-country\/folk sound. A better way to describe this album is to imagine Shawn Colvin singing Sheryl Crow's songs. Emily writes and sings lead on every song except the ballad \"Gracefully\" which is sung and composed by Martie. It's a breakup song about a woman who wants to leave a man due to his dependency on alcohol. Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers stops by to duet on \"See You In The Spring\". The foot stomper \"Ain't No Son\" is an upbeat but sad song in which a father disowns his homosexual son. The album's closing track \"Fear Of Wasted Time\" deals with Emily singing about being a mother as well as a touring musician. However, the two best tracks on this album are the songs \"I Miss You\" and \"Then Again\". Overall, it's a great album from start to finish and this marks yet another album in country music that delivered the goods in the first quarter in 2010.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"And I don't think she's writing any of her material but that's OK for now. She just started out.\n\nBut my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe. So safe that it bored me. I think I thought it was \"cute\" the first time I heard it but I still haven't seen the video and I don't care. I don't think I'll ever care for that song EVER.\n\nAnd that's fine with me.\n\nBut this single...I heard it a few times and was like \"I like it. I really do.\"\n\nIt's much more...her. I think. Still don't \"know\" the girl! But it just seems a bit less predictable. Sure, this love thing is tried and true to death, but this song is catchier to me, the production a LOT nicer (like a floating, \"this can't be real\" kinda feel) and it shows more vocal power. I will say at the end though, Jordin literally shrieks a note and it's just too loud. That could've been left out but if you don't mind belting, then this song is good pop music.\n\nThe vibe, playful and youthful (the eldest, Chris is only 18 after all).\n\nAnd even though some of you are sick to DEATH of him (me excluded), Chris does a good vocal job here too. After hearing the SMASH, \"With You\" and a few of his older tracks, I can tell that even though they had no hand in the writing of this track, that at least Chris feels his part. Surely, Jordin does too.\n\nI wish her luck in the future although I heard her album wasn't that great. Guess I didn't miss much!\n\n3.9 stars (compared to the measly 2.25 i awarded the first single, Tattoo).\n\nEnd note: I like Jordin. She's a sweety, got's a good set of pipes and she's damn pretty. However, I did have many gripes with her actually winning because although she was more marketable than Melinda (who got ROBBED!!!!!!), she didn't have the pipes like her nor quite like Lakisha.\n\nIt was sad.\n\nBut she won. It's over. Great voice. Hope to see her co-write 2 songs (at least) next go round and I wish her happiness. No surprises here.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Porcupine Tree's STEVEN WILSON has transformed the back catalogues of King Crimson and Jethro Tull in the last five years with his meticulous and sensational digital transfers  not to mention Gentle Giant, XTC, Caravan, Emerson, Lake And Palmer and Hawkwind all benefitting from his even-handed yet sympathetic ear. Artists trust their work to this man precisely because he has a love for their complexity and the technical know-how to match his and their musical passions (Ian Anderson of Tull will have their music go nowhere else). But fans of England's best experimental band YES have been licking their lips in glee over this one  Progressive Rock's most ambitious and commercially successful adventure ever  the 4-sided double-album monster that was and still is \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\" (December 1973, Atlantic K 80001 in the UK - Atlantic SD 2-908 in the USA).\n\nThe net-blurbs tell us that the 'go to' man for Classic Rock Remixes has been working on \"Tales...\" for three years on and off. Well - it was worth every painstaking minute because our Stevie has wrenched absolute magic out of his aural trick bag once again. YES fans are going to have a Topographic coronary when they get a load of the fabulous audio  but I've docked the card-wrap a star for what I feel is the staggeringly unimaginative visual presentation especially after all that hype and such a long wait.

Ritual\n\nFor such a prestigious release - I was expecting visual fireworks - but the outer box slipcase has the Roger Dean painting front cover artwork only and nothing on the rear - no details of any kind. Both the gatefold 2-disc cardholders are identical - even the booklet has the same artwork. Inside each card sleeve are the four discs - but they're housed in blank black card inners without any track details (theyre only in booklet). Where's the alternate Roger Dean artwork for the second card gatefold - or how about making the card inners interesting with tour posters - magazine advert campaigns - tape boxes - even the original Atlantic LP labels.\n\nThe first gatefold card sleeve with Disc 1 and 2 in it has the beautiful inner gatefold of the original 1973 double but the lyrics and explanations of the songwriting are barely readable and not featured in larger form in the booklet. The second card sleeve with Discs 3 and 4 has at least a live shot on the band on the inner gatefold and different RD artwork on the CD label - but that's it. The oversized 20-page booklet is a pleasant enough affair but large parts of it are taken up with just tracks-lists. Pages 2 and 3 show Steve Howe standing beside the massive American billboard advert for 'Tales From Topographic Oceans on Atlantic Records & Tapes' - but I've seen it before.\n\nOn the upside there's a nice collage of concert tickets - rare label variants from around the world peppering the text  shots of their stage show from the American tour and of course Steve Wilson's copious notes on the Audio Sources and how to get the best out of the BLU RAY's massive storage capacity. The SID SMITH liner notes (penned July 2016) are suitably informational and smartly written - but with all that visual repetition there's simply no oomph to the entire package - and not using alternate Roger Dean artwork somewhere seems like a very badly missed opportunity. I do like the BLU RAY menu that opens with the album cover in black and white that then slowly morphs into glorious colour on my 55\" tele with the Roger Dean 'YES' logo finally appearing as if by magic beneath the 'Topographic' LP title. And the choices within the three principal selections (2016 Mixes, Original Mixes and Audio Extras) are bewildering if not massively repetitive.\n\nBut at least all that underwhelming pales when you actually play the albums  the new 2016 Steven Wilson Stereo Mixes churning up details and clarity everywhere. I remember playing this dense 2LP beastie side to side back in the day  my poor worried parents concerned for their boy's sanity amidst all those synths and layered vocals and Sanskrit lyrics and his endless gawking at the encapsulated colour photos on the inner gatefold (more clouds - yum yum). Slagged off and beloved in equal measure  I've always thought of \"Tales...\" as breathtaking in its reach and this reissue only rams that home even more. That huge Wakeman synth solo during \"The Revealing Science Of God\"  the sheer prettiness of Side 2's opening passage as they sing of '...velvet sailors...' and '...moments that start to linger...' - the adventurous percussive Side 3 with rattling cymbals and those manic rhythms where Howe's guitar does a Japanese hula-hula dance on your speakers - ending in my favourite part - the brilliant and varied \"Ritual\" - Squire making his Bass heard above all that Mellotron and that genius break into percussive chanting and then dancing - 'Nous Somme Du Soleil' indeed.\n\nI hadn't expected much from the 'Studio Run-Through' Alternatives or a live version of \"Ritual\" - but how wrong can you be. When Howe goes into that solo at the end of \"Ritual\" he's ripping up and down the frets like a demented Robert Fripp and then it changes into that bizarre percussive section that sounds vaguely Chinese - in the live environment - it's explosive stuff and the bands playing virtuosity a thing of genuine wonder.\n\nWhen I worked in Reckless Records in Soho  even the albums name would engender giggles and sighs of disbelief. The young ones would look at me corkscrewed when I told them of its lofty chart position  is he mad? Yes's \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\" went No. 1 in the UK on release in December 1973 and achieved No. 6 in the USA - incredible for such a challenging double and a music-form referred to as naff only two years later.\n\nTime has proven the public right  and Steven Wilson has done this YES music a powerful justice. I just wish I wasn't so nonplussed by the visuals for something I loved so much (docked a star for that). Over to you...","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: This Far From Memphis, Leaving a Lonely Town, Don't Ask Me About A Woman\n\nBehind a great record stands a great producer.  Just when country music has been hijacked by the derivative rock of the 70s and the drivel of adult contemporary shtick of the 90s, this record is the avatar that there's still hope for fans of the traditional persuasion.  This album's raison detre is to a large measure due to presence of producer Carson Chamberlain.  Being the man who wrote some of country music's cornerstone pieces such as George Strait's chart topper \"The Best Day,\" Alan Jackson's \"Love's Got a Hold on You\" and Tanya Tucker's classic tearjerker \"(Without You) What Do I Do With Me,\" Chamberlain has given this disc a traditional push that sets this release apart from the current radio fare with nary a cacophonous chorus of noise or screeching electric guitar riffs.  Rather, listening to this CD calls to mind an amalgam of the countrified sounds of George Strait, the mournful cries of Keith Whitley and the tropical escapism of Kenny Chesney.  Vocally, Easton Corbin does have a southern drawled tenor that calls to mind the aforementioned Chesney without sounding too distinctive.  Nevertheless, it's the songs that make this record a stand out.\n\nFirst and foremost, Easton Corbin is to be congratulated for his hard work in learning from the best country music in town.  You could almost hear Alan Jackson singing \"Don't Ask Me About a Woman.\" This is the type of record that made Alan Jackson such a superstar:  clever use of words over a humorous take on the gender divide all over an infectious melody.  And Easton Corbin is wizened to take this a signature hit to come and make it his very own.  The carefree \"A Lot to Learn About Leavin'\" calls to mind Kenny Chesney with its Cuban-island relaxing feel.  Tony Lane and Johnny Park's \"Roll with It\" has an uncanny resemblance to George Strait's mega hit \"Run\" except that it is set at a faster pace with pronounced fiddling.  The jaunty \"The Way Love Looks\" triumphs on its sunny disposition over some Diamond Rio-esque guitar and Corbin's Brad- Paisley type excitement.\n\nDespite Easton Corbin's tipping his hat to his sonic heroes, it doesn't mean he is bereft of his own signature authenticity.  The saccharine \"Someday When I'm Old\" has a bluesy feel that is riverting piece to listen to.  One of the best road songs this year has to be \"This Far From Memphis,\" which scores the record's best original line \"Now I've run out of road\/So I guess my only hope is to trade this truck for a boat.\" If you want to hear Corbin bear out his soul, take a listen to the mournful \"Leavin' a Lonely Town\" and prepare for some tearful moments as Corbin bids his parents goodbye as he leaves home.  Lead single \"A Little More Country Than That\" may not chart new grounds with its picturesque reference about Corbin's own self identification with everything rural, but it has such a gorgeous melody that it stays etched into the memory for the long haul.\n\nFor a debut record, Easton Corbin's self titled release is a winner.  It doesn't yield to the temptation to crossover to the pop market nor does it endeavour to be sound hip without regards to the album's depth.  Rather rifle with clever and catchy tunes over a backing which is afraid to let the steel guitar and fiddles take the lead, this is a bona fide country record.  And producer Carson Chamberlain is to be congratulated together with Corbin for a job well done.","classification":5,"fold":2}

I admit that I was drawn in because of the guitars and the well timed singing of this song. However, I did not figure out the meaning of the song until after I lived here in the Washington D.C. area (through online sources).

{"text":"This brilliant showpiece CD brings together two separate LPs, the Pines and Fountains of Rome from 1978, the Ancient airs and Dances, along with the Albinoni and Boccherini form 1973. The Albinoni Adagio foretells the immense success of the Karajan Adagio series, which have earned DG millions of dollars. But these fillers are simply lush show-offs for the famous Berlin string sound.\n\nthe main attraction is Karajan's sumptuous yet refined way with the Pines and Fountains. Frankly, Respighi survives largely because of Toscanini's advocacy, and it would be hard to beat his electrifying accounts of both works, despsite outdated mono sound. The Berlin Phil. is incomparably more viruosic than the NBC Sym., and Karajan's sophisticated way with this second-rate, splashy music may not please everyone. He's out to civilize it, and for many that's exactly the wrong approach. Without its vulgar energy, Respighi's music has little else to offer. (Collectors of the Pines also complain that the nightingale recording used here is too drab. Okay.)\n\nFor me, owning one version of the Pines and Fountains is more than enough, and I nominate Reiner's famous version in Living Stereo on RCA, an all-out blockbuster. But Karajan's worldly approach is certainly worth a listen for its power and musicality.","classification":5,"fold":2}

All of her songs still ignite whether it is in the films, or when was on the stage. That is definitely the case with the music from The Preacher's Wife, and her rendition of I Believe In You & Me. Her cover of The Four Tops classic is still just as definitive today, as when it came out in the mid 90's. For her to follow up what she did with I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard was difficult, but the song is still a classic. I love her song from The Preacher's Wife, not just because it is classic Whitney, but still is just as soft as a newborn baby's smile.

{"text":"\"Badlands\" by Halsey is what you call a \"spur of the moment\" purchase. I didn't know much about Halsey (besides the song, \"Ghost) but I'm extremely impressed with this astonishing album. Her music is electro-pop. I love that genre of music but it's a tricky genre to make just right, cohesively. Sometimes electro-pop can come off manufactured, flat, or too glossy. \"Badlands\" is the perfect balance of dark, gutsy, and haunting pop, but it's still catchy, playful, and fresh. I got this album at Target. I think the Target version is worth it if you're looking for more tracks. My version has 16 tracks instead of 11. More bang for your buck! There's 5 essential tracks that I can't get enough of: \"Castle\", \"Hurricane\", \"Colors\", \"Haunting\", and \"Control\". Halsey's voice is really pretty (very melodic). I like that she doesn't scream the songs. She's easy to understand. She doesn't sing like she has marbles in her mouth. There's really not one bad song in the bunch. \"Hold Me Down\", \"New Americana\", \"Young God\", \"Coming Down\", and \"Roman Holiday\" are absolutely stellar. I love \"Drive\". It's very laid-back but emotional. \"Colors Pt. II\" is a short remix but it's lovely. \"Ghost\" was the track that made me a Halsey fan. \"Gasoline\" and \"Strange Love\" are incredibly hypnotic. There's an awesome cover of Johnny Cash's, \"I Walk the Line\". I love Halsey's interpretation. The track is stripped down (love the piano) and so romantic. \"Badlands\" is worth it just for \"Hurricane\". I could listen to that song all day. Musically, this is the best electro-pop album I've ever heard. You can tell Halsey and the producers worked really hard to make this record sound flawless and meaningful. The hooks, melodies, lyrics, and arrangements are remarkable. She's such an underrated artist. I hope she makes another album soon. This is good music. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Are you in the mood for some good ol country music mixed with a modern funky vibe and sweet melodies? Then this album is definitely for you. I've glimpsed Little Big Town online one time too many and have even promised to check out their songs but never got around to doing so. Interestingly enough, a Tornado was all it took to get my attention. I rely heavily on first impressions; if I'm not intrigued from the very first listen, whether or not I played samples or the songs in full, I'll pass on doing a review. But after listening to the opening track I just had to dive into the rest.\n\nPavement Ends had me bumping my head, clapping my hands, and stomping my feet. The song's about reflecting (on their roots) on how carefree life is or was. Its upbeat sound and fierce singing compliments the raw lyrics. What I had no idea about is that the group alternates on lead vocals. And I think that the energetic nature of this track resounds even more with the strong male upfront. He makes life sound pretty wild and spontaneous on this one.\n\nAren't country musicians amazingly talented? They can write songs even about boats and make it sound so irresistibly sexy. Aside from the fact that I now want to go chill out on a Pontoon, I can't get over how fun and relaxing the song really is. Those melodious strings at start captured my attention before the track kicked off, and by the time Karen started singing in that laid back no cares in the world tone, I was completely drawn in. This is the Summer by the lake anthem powerful enough to have you thinking of bikinis and barbecues in Winter. It's even more wonderful that the music video depicted the song's message.\n\nAfter that previous number I needed a few minutes to recover and get that energy going again. Sober may not be upbeat, but it certainly had me alerted. The track thrusted me into an emotional ocean; I was literally swimming in the heartfelt singing and far from generic lyrics. Kimberly, like most of us (if not all) doesn't ever want to leave the embrace of love. Its the realness of the song that makes it an exceptional potential of being a single. It has mesmerized one soul already.\n\nWhoa! All four harmonize beautifully. Still, each has his\/her own distinctive sound that shines without overshadowing the other. While the guys take lead on Front Porch Thing, the ladies are just as astounding on the hook. The bluesy track offers a gritty and raw feeling proven to be quite indescribable. Though, the boldness is restrained for a more softer tone in Your Side of the Bed. The lonely number is quite an example of a sad country ballad, but don't go comparing it to any other. This tearjerker is a undoubtedly a masterpiece in itself, sniffy nose, puffy eyes and heartache aside. The fact that its a duet made me grip my chest tighter.\n\nThe tempo is heightened but Leavin' In Your Eyes is indeniable a continuation of the previous. In this case, the relationship is done from one person's perspective, while the other hopes to rekindle the flame. The song features a male lead pouring his heart out, with the girls intensifying the anguish in the chorus.\n\nI must say, Karen brings it on the title track. Tornado is all about taking a stand; rising up to the man's surprise. The fearsome beat is complimented by her confident fire, igniting on every note. And that dominant laugh echoing in the background is the highlight of this badass track. Tornado is my favorite on the album. I congratulate female empowerment wherever it is found.\n\nOn Fire Tonight is indeed hot. The girls dominated this track (with the guys adding edge here and there). This song takes entertainment to another level, inducing playful elements at every corner. Both ladies blend perfectly together on lead,  if you aren't careful you might end up unable to decipher who is singing what part, but then again that's hardly the point when you're having a good time.\n\nThe sultry and soulful Can't Go Back is the vocal highlight of the entire album, portraying pure and passionate harmonizing and flawless singing from each member. Whether you fall in love with the truth of the lyrics or the acoustic sounds, its a song you have to agree has a life of its own.\n\nThe bluesy rock inspired Self Made gave off a live concert feel in the opening and throughout the track you can hear a story unfolding. This is a motivational song about relying on your own efforts to achieve your dreams. Its better to gain success from hard-work and determination, rather than selling your soul. I'm loving it.\n\nThe album wraps, not the way it started in an adrenaline, but on a more smoother and softer note. Night Owl is all about love; staying up waiting for the one you love to return. Their voices sway like calm waves and rushes into my heart when its called for. I wouldn't expect such a slow track to end things but I'm impressed nonetheless.\n\nI enjoyed this album to a point where I'll now go digging for every song the band's ever released like a beyond devoted fan. Is it safe to say LBT is my new addiction? Well, regardless if I'm getting too excited, I'm glad I found them. My only beef with Tornado is that it went by so quickly. Never thought I would say such a thing.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"It took me a year to fully embrace Brandon Flowers' first solo record, \"Flamingo\". \"Flamingo\" is a good album but it wasn't great. But I'm happy to say that Brandon's second solo effort, \"The Desired Effect\" is DEFINTELY GREAT! This album is so fun. The sunny melodies, gorgeous harmonies, (love those background singers) effortless hooks, and intelligent songwriting on \"The Desired Effect\" will take your breath away. These 10 songs are full of emotions! That's what makes his music so special and memorable. He pours his heart and soul into every track. Everything he sings is sincere and real. And just so you know, I'm also a HUGE fan of his band, The Killers. Have been since the beginning (\"Somebody Told Me\" music video, anyone?). Brandon's voice on \"The Desired Effect\" sounds crystal-clear and strong. I've always loved his unique voice. He has only gotten better with age. You can FEEL his passion. He's awesome.\n\nThe songs on \"The Desired Effect\" are reminiscent of '80s pop music. I like the variety on this record. There's a little bit of everything. The opener, \"Dreams Come True\" is loud and glorious. Hook after hook. This song is powerful and relentless. Full of energy. \"Still Want You\" has strong undertones of reggae and calypso. Whereas, \"Diggin' Up The Heart\" borrows from rockabilly and alt-country. This song is very Springsteen-esque. Great storytelling and multiple tempo changes. The BEST track is \"I Can Change\" which features a killer sample of Bronski Beat's classic '80s gem, \"Smalltown Boy\". The results: SIMPLY SPLENDID.  I can't get enough of this track. There's a couple of amazing new wave tracks starting with \"Can't Deny My Love\" and \"Lonely Town\". Love the synths and catchy melodies. There's some beautiful ballads that will tug at your heartstrings including, \"Between Me And You\" and \"Never Get You Right\" which both feature Bruce Hornsby on piano. \"Untangled Love\" is a pop masterpiece featuring The Killers', Ronnie Vannucci on drums. And the slow-burner, \"The Way It's Always Been\" is the perfect way to end this incredible album. The song is introspective. Brandon reflects on his religious upbringing and Las Vegas roots. He's proud of where he comes from, it's evident when he sings.\n\n\"The Desired Effect\" is worth every penny. It's vibrant, sexy, and hypnotic. It will make you want to get up dance. Good pop music is hard to find so I highly recommend it. BUY. THIS. ALBUM. NOW. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":2}

Gloria Gaynor has a very powerful and beautiful voice, and the music will just take you along with her song as she tells her lover to leave,\" walk out the door, I don't need you anymore... I will survive, I will survive.\"  If you even doubt you can survive on your own when things don't work out with someone not being so kind to you, this song gives encouragement and power.  It is extremely uplifting.  One you will want to hear over and over just for it's amazing power and good music.","classification":5,"fold":2}
{"text":"Sometimes, all of us want to escape the 'drudgeries' of every day life.  The idea of someone holding '2 tickets to Paradise' in their hand - and just waiting to give them to me - to 'take me on a trip so far from here' - is, quite appealing to me - especially at this juncture in life.\n\nAlthough there is no 'love' component to the song, which, typically I find to be the most attractive aspect - the promise of 'relief' from daily pressures, plus, the idea that I might have a '+1' on my 'trip,' brings me inspiration and, most importantly, hope.\n\nGood stuff - the song, that is.\n\nI created a slideshow on my computer with this music - paradise is looking pretty good - even if me and my '+1' just get to spend two weeks at an all inclusive resort somewhere in the Caribbean.  There is, after all, in reality - 'No place like home.'\n\nThey just don't make'em like they used to.\n\n$1.29 for '2 Tickets to Paradise.'\n\nA wise investment - in one man's humble opinion.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones \"Coming Down Again\" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.\n\nThis album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. \"Hot Stuff\" is funky; reggae is evident with \"Cherry Oh Baby\"; and \"Melody\" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).\n\nNo, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say\n\n\"I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!\"\n\nThe resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being \"Bad Boys.\"\n\nOne last thing....\n\nJust wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment \"Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording\"\n\nTechnically incorrect.\n\n-- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., \"Revolution\" from the White Album).\n\n-- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune \"Yer Blues\" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.\n\nMore technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:\n\n-- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single \"Let it Be.\" The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called \"You Know My Name (look up the number).\" Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.\n\n-- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune \"Yer Blues\" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.\n\n-- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release \"All You Need is Love.\"\n\n-- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release \"Sing This All Together.\"","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"I bought three country artist debuts in 1986:  Dwight Yoakam's GUITARS, CADILLACS, ETC., ETC.; Steve Earle's GUITAR TOWN; and Randy Travis's STORMS OF LIFE. Without question, Travis has had the greatest chart success. His debut sold 4 million copies and spawned four Top 10 singles (\"1982,\" \"On the Other Hand,\" \"Diggin' Up Bones\" and \"No Place Like Home\"--all included here). To date, he's had dozens of Top 40 hits including 16 No. 1's.\n\nBack in 1986, Travis's traditional approach to country music was a breath of fresh air. He was one of the reasons I wasn't embarrassed to admit I like country music. I already owned 2002's 2-CD collection THE RANDY TRAVIS ANTHOLOGY and was reluctant to shell out for this 2009 update until Amazon offered a super-discounted price on it.\n\nANTHOLOGY has 44 tracks and ULTIMATE HITS contains only 32. What this means is there is plenty of overlap, but there are additions.  Here's the eight tracks (in the order they appear on the album) that were not on ANTHOLOGY:\n\n\"Promises\" No. 17, 1989, from OLD 8x10\n\"Three Wooden Crosses\" No 1, 2002, from RISE AND SHINE\n\"Faith in You\"  (failed to chart), 2008, from AROUND THE BEND\n\"Love's Alive and Well\" (released as part of the Three Wooden Crosses EP)\n\"King of the Road\" No. 51, 1997, from FULL CIRCLE (used in the film \"Traveller\")\n\"Are We in Trouble Now\" No. 24, 1996, from FULL CIRCLE\n\"Turn It Around\" (failed to chart), 2009, from AROUND THE BEND\n\"You Ain't Right\" (new recording for this collection)\n\nWhile the 2009 recording \"You Ain't Right\" is straight ahead country with electric guitars and fiddle, Travis's only studio album since this compilation found him returning to his gospel roots.\n\nAll told, this is a terrific collection. If you don't already own ANTHOLOGY, I'd give the nod to ULTIMATE HITS just because it includes some of his latter hits.  However, if you already own ANTHOLOGY--or all of his studio albums--the final track is the only new song. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","classification":5,"fold":2}

We don't take the time, as Jeanne has done, to actually NOTICE the things that are funny in the world.  Like the absolute greatest masters of the comedic form, Mrs. Robertson doesn't \"make up stuff\" or \"tell jokes\".  She simply lets us take a glimpse at the world at she sees it.  She holds a mirror up to life and finds hilarious that which is looking back.\n\nShe has several funny, FUNNY recordings which you can get as audio or DVD recordings, but \"Southern Style\" is easily in her top 2 or 3 and includes perhaps her most famous story of all: \"Left Brain's Grocery List\" could stand toe to toe with Bill Cosby's \"Noah\" or Richard Pryor's \"Mudbone\" or Andy Griffith's \"What it was, was Football\".\n\nMrs. Robertson's husband is named Jerry, but she calls him \"Left Brain\" and if you don't understand that, as she says, you may be one too...  Jeanne has been drafted into making several of her famous 7-up pound cakes, and needs to dispatch Jerry to the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients.  You'll just have to hear the results, but as the tears roll down your cheeks with laughter the part of your soul that recognizes the truthfulness of things will know there is a little Left Brain in most of us.\n\nThank Heaven for BOTH of the Robertsons and for Jeanne's gift for sharing her magnificently cultivated sense of humor.\n\nA final word: perhaps most miraculously of all, Mrs. Robertson makes you laugh and laugh and laugh with nary an off-color word.

{"text":"You know, I never heard of Robert Randolph until I caught a sampling of 'The Word' album on an independent radio station about a year ago. After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project, I must say I was absolutely floored! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Carlos Santana, and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are. Simply put, the brother got \"MAD SKILLZ\"!!!\n\nThe same can also be said of his stellar backing unit known simply as the Family Band, whose sound I found it best to describe as being a unique hybrid of the Allman Brothers' roots-based  rock and Graham Central Station's sanctified funk. On this, their first studio-conceived album, nearly all the tracks shine from the infectiously \"gospel-delic\" groove laid down by the band as well as the industrial strength of Randolph's pedal steel work (which is a joy to behold in itself). I would've given this a 5-star rating if some of the jams were extended for greater effect, but that's just a minor complaint linked mainly to personal preference. On the other hand, I do know a good band when I hear one and something tells me that Robert Randolph & Co. aren't that far off from becoming one of the most exciting and influential bands of their generation (MY generation to be specific).\n\nHIGHLY recommended, but also get their live album as well. This band is definitely one of the best concert draws going today.","classification":4,"fold":2}

An extended jam session, meandering, wandering, in no rush to get somewhere and with nowhere in particular to be.  Youll hear some familiar notes that echo past projects but in only brief teasing moments, some lite atmospherics, and a Stephen Hawking sample.  This music was meant for meditation, for checking out, for zoning out.  Only the last track, Louder Than Words which is a summary reflection of the band and its members interactions with one another, is approached as a commercial song (and its merely okay as a Floyd song goes).  Everything else is ambience and subtle melody with floating and weepy Gilmour guitars.  Its pleasant but I was hoping for more from one of historys most innovative rock bands.

Stand-outs include \"Unfinished\" (a techno sound\/r 'n b with a beautiful melody & vocals.

{"text":"The original Volume 1 of It's Too Late to Stop Now was first released in 1974 and showcases the best moments distilled from three live performances on Van's 1973 world tour: at The Troubadour in LA, the Santa Monica Civic and the great and much-missed Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London (which, alas, is no more). Many make a convincing case that this is the greatest live-performance album of all time, by any artist.\n\nVan has always been a multi-talented writer, producer and arranger and this tour featured his Caledonia Soul Orchestra with string and brass sections complementing the rock music instrumental backing line-up to highlight every mood change during the gig: brass for the full-on rock\/soul numbers, strings to fill out the more atmospheric pieces, and the whole held together by Van's unique, powerful and insistent vocal. The result by any logic shouldn't even work, but Van's extraordinary genius for synthesising different styles into his own trademark sound makes for a one-off, an all-time great. Even if you're not a committed Van Morrison fan, listen and you'll understand why he inspires such respect and has such a loyal fan base. From the explosive opener When you got a heartache youll just be overtaken by the irresistible urge to jump to your feet and dance  even if you're driving, which can be a problem!\n\nI saw this line-up live at the very first Knebworth One-Day Festival on a hot summer Saturday in 1974 (I was very young and it was my first ever outdoor concert), and have never forgotten Van belting out those powerful, soulful vocals into the summer afternoon sunshine backed by a band so tight, so seamlessly unified yet infinitely flexible and responsive they were one beautiful organic whole, to treat the listener to a truly awesome, unforgettable experience. Since that day, I have been a die-hard Van Morrison fan.\n\nThe 18 numbers performed on this album are the best of the best, performed by one of the world's great musical artists in his prime, still with the power and restlessness of youth in his soul but with enough experience and maturity to understand the complexities of sound and instrumentation mix and the discipline necessary to pull it together and make it work. The power of Van's vocal delivery and his ability for on-the-spot improvisation to go with the mood of the moment often belie the committed professionalism of execution, the attention to minor details behind the performance. It's masterful.\n\nThis album is a true classic. It's outstanding; it has soul. Whichever of the various releases over the years you listen to (it doesn't really matter), just listen to it. Then buy the 2016-released package containing volumes 2, 3 & 4.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I really hope that THE INEVITABLE END really isn't the end of Ryksopp, but even if it is, theyve had a good, long run of excellent tracks. On this album, they embrace their pop leanings even more fully, as Skulls kicks things off with a slab of darker-tinged electro, which soon enough turns bouncy. A more beat-driven version of Monument appears here too, as opposed to the softer version from DO IT AGAIN, while the softer Sordid Affair and Compulsion drizzle on some romance. The airy You Know I Have to Go floats around the atmosphere, before Save Me brings things back to earth. But I Had This Thing mixes the earthiness of the bass with the atmospherics for a track that straddles both worlds. Running to the Sea, their hit, is a blast of pure pop joy aimed directly at the dancefloor. But the quietly graceful Coup de Grace, leads into piano-driven Thank You, a gentle goodbye. But its not quite done yet: on the bonus disc, theres a bonus mix of Do It Again, which emphasizes the breaks, as well as four additional tracks, from the dreamy Goodnite, Mr. Sweetheart and the short, string quartet Oh No and finally to the mutant R&B of Something in My Heart. A great way to end a great career.","classification":4,"fold":2}

{"text":"After Rhino released the near-definitive 2-CD collection THE VERY BEST OF: ONLY THE BEGINNING in 2002, I was a bit confused by the title.  \"Only the Beginning?\" Hey! Chicago hasn't had a top 40 hit since 1991's \"Chasin' the Wind.\" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear.  That album was only the beginning of repackaging Chicago's material.\n\nThere's really little new here if you already own THE VERY BEST OF.  \"If You Leave Me Now\" is a live version with Philip Bailey. Another live version is \"After the Love Is Gone\" featuring Earth, WInd & Fire.  \"Never Been in Love Before\" is from 1975's CHICAGO VIII.  And \"Here in My Heart\" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.\n\nSo what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?\n\nDon't get me wrong. If all you're looking for is Chicago's love songs--and ONLY their love songs, this is a solid collection.  My only problem with this is that it presents the group as a bit too one dimensional.","classification":3,"fold":2}

For Sevyn Streeter who sung back on Chris Brown's big hit She Ain't You, which worked very well for him, she has to have a song make it on her own and work brilliantly. Her debut single, It Won't Stop from her first record Call Me Crazy, But.. isn't actually a strong song from her voice alone. I really found it more drowned out from her, because Chris Brown's voice overpowers the song so much, that it feels more like her sonnets are robotic and not as strong. Does the strong work, well it would work more from her if she was going to bring more from her voice and heart. She might sound sensual in the beat, but Sevyn doesn't at all. Hopefully, with her net set of songs there will be better from her to match and beyond, than she could say It Won't Stop.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":2}

{"text":"Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs, but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album.  The 2-minute \"Political Science\" is certainly one of his greatest achievements, and the song is just as timely now as it was in 1973.  What makes the lyric so great is that it distills exactly what so many Americans think about the world.  It could be your friendly next-door neighbor, who seems like a perfectly nice person until you stumble into a  political discussion, and then you realize that he is an immoral monster.  It seems to me that \"Political Science\" should be the national anthem -- it's what large numbers of Americans  really think, and if they disagree then they should be forced to change the attitude as well as the policies before they change the song.\n\n I would like to include the entire lyric, but here is a sample:\n\n \"We give them money, but are they grateful, no they're spiteful and they're hateful.  They don't respect us, so let's surprise 'em, let's drop The Big One and pulverize 'em.\"\n\n \"Boom goes London, and boom Pay-ree, more room for you and more room for me.  Every city the whole world round will just be another American town, oh how peaceful it will be, we'll set everybody free ... They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop The Big One now.\"\n\n Is Randy Newman being too sarcastic, too harsh?  Just look at the anti-French movement among the republicanus neanderthalis recently -- \"nuke France and gimme some Freedom Fries with my burger\" -- and it seems clear that if anything he is too kind.\n\n Thank goodness for Randy Newman in times like these.  Along with Mose Allison, Stan Ridgway (see my 7\/29\/04 review of his brilliant latest, SNAKEBITE), and a few other mavericks, he understands America's dark side well enough to deflate its pretensions and hypocrisy  with humor, from the inside.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"\"Beyond the Turning\" is pianist\/composer Heidi Breyer's third album to date, following her award-winning and critically-acclaimed 2010 release, \"Another Place and Time.\" Like her previous album, the fourteen tracks on \"Beyond the Turning\" are a varied mix of styles that contain elements of classical, jazz, folk, new age, and pop music blended to create Heidi Breyer's unique voice and vision. The other musicians on the album are as varied as the music and bring an eclectic sound to the mix. Breyer adds her delicate vocals to the two cover tunes and presents her first ever recorded improvisation (\"The Long Way Home, Passages 1-3\"), making this album a musical and emotional journey.\n\n\"Beyond the Turning\" opens with \"Farewell,\" a piece that contains one of the album's biggest surprises. Beginning as a heartfelt piano solo, I was blown away when David Cullen's electric guitar entered at about the halfway point. Breyer heard this piece as a piano and electric guitar duet when she wrote it and refused to compromise on the unique combination of instruments. I wasn't sure I liked that combination at first, but Cullen's passionate playing communicates so well and contrasts so dramatically with the piano that it won me over. \"World Without End\" was inspired by a painting by Alexander Volkov. This is actually the third version of this piece, which Breyer concedes may never be completely finished. Her piano, Eugene Friesen's cello, and Samite's vocals give it a hauntingly beautiful expression. \"My Peace Piece\" is a piano solo dedicated to jazz pianist Bill Evans. Slow, fluid, and very graceful, this one's a favorite. So is \"Rive Droite,\" which features the violin artistry of the amazing Charlie Bisharat and Bob Colwell on accordion in addition to Breyer's rhythmic and sensual piano. I also really like \"Eight Steps Free,\" a duet for piano and lyricon (an electronic wind instrument with a very ethereal quality) played by Premik Russell-Tubbs. \"Tea and Sympathy\" is an arrangement of one of Janis Ian's classics. Guitar, piano, and bass are a simple but very effective accompaniment to Breyer's heartfelt vocals and Ian's poetic lyrics. \"Moondancing\" was an experiment in rhythm and is the first of Breyer's pieces with percussion (tam-tam). Russell-Tubbs' soulful saxophone adds the  perfect emotional element and makes it soar. The title track is a gorgeous duet for piano and English horn (Jill Haley) that expresses the realization that there are so many turns in the roads we travel in life, often wondering what lies \"beyond the turning,\" and the inner peace that comes with the acceptance that the turning happens every day and letting it flow through us.\n\nRecommended!","classification":5,"fold":2}

A very believable vocal performance. \"It's Not Right\" is pleasant. \"Say Goodbye\" is nice. \"Lifetime\" is extremely cute and bouncy. At first it doesn't seem like much but when you listen to the lyrics you really start to love it. \"Anybody's Heart\" isn't so bad. The title track is also pretty. But most of the other material is flat. I'm actually shocked that our Katharine went into the studio, happily recorded these songs and probably said, \"Wow.

{"text":"The New York indie rock band Interpol arrived on the scene just in time as indie rock was making its way into the mainstream. Right after the successes of The Strokes and The White Stripes, the quartet released their debut \"Turn On The Bright Lights\" on long standing indie label Matador Records. Though the album didn't become commercially successful, they got rave reviews from numerous music critics ans even managed to have their recording listed as one of the best albums of 2002. Commercial success finally came their way in the form of their sophomore album \"Antics\", which yielded the popular radio singles \"Slow Hands\" and \"Evil\". After being on music critics' best of lists once again, the major label bidding war started happening for them. Rumors ran rampant about the band signing to Interscope Records- which they had to dispel very quickly- but they signed with Capitol instead. In 2007, their major label release \"Our Love To Admire\" was given fairly decent acclaim, but was all but ignored by Capitol. As a result, they left the label in 2009. In an ironic twist, they re-signed to their previous label Matador and watched as their \"Antics\" album attain a Gold certification from the RIAA. In 2010, they started writing new songs for their next album.\n\nBy the summer, bassist Carlos Denger left to pursue other interests- namely, scoring films. When the self-titled \"Interpol\" arrived in the fall, the band- as well as the fans- were unsure if they were going to continue. To that end, the members decided to go on hiatus and pursue projects outside of the band. Fast forward four years later and the former quarter is now down to a trio. The official lineup is now drummer Sam Fogarino, guitarist Daniel Kessler and lead singer\/guitarist Paul Banks- who took over the role of bassist since the departure of Dengler. In September 2014, they released their fifth recording- and first as a trio-  \"El Pintor\". The title shares a double meaning: In Spanish, it means \"the painter\", while as an anagram is also the band's name. Much like their last album, it was self-produced with mixing by Nine Inch Nails associate Alan Moulder. The opening track \"All The Rage Back Home\" shows a man's conflicted feelings toward a past love and walks away from being manipulated on \"My Desire\". Observing an former flame's new relationship is the focus of \"Same Town, New Story\", while \"My Blue Supreme\" ponders a potential breakup. \"Everything Is Wrong\" centers around wanting to start off with a clean slate after falling in love for all the wrong reasons. Beck's longtime keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning, Jr. plays on \"Tidal Wave\", while Interpol member Daniel Kessler gets behind the piano for the album closer \"Twice As Hard\". \"El Pintor\" is a great listen from Interpol. It's not much different from their earlier work, but it is worthy of a few spins.","classification":5,"fold":2}

Im taking the song to be an upbeat tune where he is expressing that the person he is singing about gives him an emotional\/euphoric buzz and from the positive imagery of the video she is the perfect combo of being sweet (with his mentioning honey) but adding to his life through her multi-dimensional personality.

{"text":"Forms of poetry are often logos of memes with positive flaws while songs have new kinds of sentences, considering my patience with time as though my eyes are actually the students for these ears under my hair.  Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":2}

I think the new album could endure the test of time because it speaks to so much change in Emmylou and in our country.

{"text":"I was highly anticipating this album. It has been 8 years since these guys made an album together, and I must say that I'm just a little disappointed with it. The album starts of strong with the Evidence- produced title track 'Directors of Photography' , then the Alchemist-produced 'Cut My Teeth'. Both great songs that gave me a lot of hope for the rest of the album, unfortunately, they are 2 of maybe like 5 tracks that I liked on this thing. Other ones being 'Good as Gone' produced by DJ Premier, and the track featuring Gangrene. Actually, I think thats my favorite track on here. Love that beat.\n\nThe other tracks just fall short of being good, in my opinion. A few songs have annoying singing on the hook. I'm sorry, but singing and hip-hop rarely sound good together. Whenever I hear an R&B type of hook on a hip hop track, I can't help but just pass it off as some soft batch ish. I just can't get with it.\n\nOverall, its an OK record. I think too many different producers on it makes it sound a bit inconsistent (a problem I frequently have with albums who feature multiple producers) I kinda wish Alchemist and Evidence would have handled all of the production.  I think I like all of thier previous albums more. Not a terrible album at all, I just expected better.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Straight No Chaser has enjoyed considerable success; and it's albums like this one that show why they're well respected. The CD is short but these numbers shine brighter than silver and gold combined; these men sing remarkably well. The quality of the sound is excellent and that artwork is great.\n\nThe album opens with a stunning treatment of Amy Winehouse's \"Rehab.\" \"Rehab\" gets the royal treatment from these fine artists and I think Amy would approve of their version of her song! Straight No Chaser uses their excellent technique of balancing members who are harmonizing with others singing the principal lyrics to the song; and thus it all holds its own very well. \"I'm Yours\" sounds quite good when Straight No Chaser tackles it; their version of Jason Mraz's tune sounds just fine and when they go into \"Over the Rainbow\" the medley becomes truly very memorable.\n\n\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\" gets a fine arrangement and the members of Straight No Chaser never let go of a single superfluous note. I'm impressed. There's also a very good medley of \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" and \"I Was Made to Love Her;\" they make \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" flow very smoothly into \"I Was Made to Love Her\" and this track is one of my favorites on this album. That's a fine mini-salute to Stevie Wonder there!\n\n\"You Send Me\" is easy on the ear and that doo wop flavor really enhances this ballad. The CD closes with Straight No Chaser performing a Frankie Valli song, \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You.\" This romantic, classic love song shines like silver and gold in their capable hands.\n\nStraight No Chaser turned out an excellent set of songs for this Amazon exclusive CD; I would highly recommend this for their fans. In addition, people who enjoy high quality control music will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I normally don't review items that do not need closer scrutiny. I mean, EVERYONE has heard of AC\/DC. AC\/DC's sound; so distinct, so clean and tight, so \"RAW ROCK\" that each new generation that comes along hears the unique, universal, driving sound, and the newbies pick it up and makes this band their own. I've listened to this band for more years than I'll ever admit to, and I have every album they ever made. Through the years, behind the music, there was a story that is still being written. I'm reviewing this one because it was one of the best featuring the original singer, Bon Scott. Bon had a cynical but humorous outlook that was loved by all. He took care of the band like raising his kid brothers. His tongue in cheek bravado, kept the band together. His unwavering confidence in his boys was absolute. Just listen to the lyrics. In the beginning they barely earned enough money to eat, or clothe themselves. Their sound was distinct and catching. During an interview, someone asked Angus Young what kind of \"effects\" did he use to get his sound. Angus replied that he didn't; he simply plugged in his Gibson SG Custom (that guitar costs about $7000 nowadays, and was\/is one of the only Gibson guitars that ever came out of the factory with a tremulow bar. The custom has pearl inlay, double humbucker coils, and Gibson guitars is one of the few guitars that are built out of SOLID mahogany, topped off with a lock nut, that will NOT, even after an hour of being tortured, GO OUT OF TUNE!) Angus took this, arguably, best guitar ever made,  and plugged it into a monster Marshal stack and turned it up as loud as it would go...and that's it. No effects or mixing. Just balls to the walls Rock. And one last thing: Angus' brother Malcolm. If the truth be known, Malcolm's PERFECT rhythm guitar playing MADE AC\/DC's sound. While Angus, the band's \"gimmick\" --dressed in his (for real) school uniform-- ran around out front, amazing the crowds, playing some of the best riffs of all time, with his small stature, the crowd thought it was a CHILD eating this guitar alive. While getting all of this attention...well, it was MALCOLM that carried their sound. He stayed off to the side in the shadows, his head bowed in concentration, he never looked up, no one paid any attention, but Malcolm had this incredible timing and that big fat rhythm sound, and he never EVER, so much as missed a single chord! The cleanest rhythm I ever heard. Wow...One of the kings of the Guitar Rock era.\n  I wrote this review for Bon (RIP) and Malcom.","classification":5,"fold":2}

For Fantasia Burrino, she honestly though hasn't been able to deliver for awhile, she did make a nice impact with her single Even Angels earlier this year, but her latest single Bittersweet feels a bit bittersweet. The song actually takes a sample from Chrisette Michele's What You Do, which is ironic because the original from Chrisette was actually much stronger. I really wasn't fond of the song. It actually was not her best or anything that felt fully strong from Fantasia that really captured me. Hopefully when her 3rd record comes out, she'll find something bigger than being bittersweet.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully...They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's\"Nickel Romeo,\" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (\"Something That You Said\", \"I Will Take Care of You\", \"Grateful\"). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles work, period, on \"Ask Me No Questions\" and \"Here Right Now,\" and Vicki sounds great on \"Single by Choice,\" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock.\" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \"Mixed Messages\"? As for \"The Rain Song,\" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!\nThe ensemble vocals on \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Stealing Rosemary\" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch. My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened _Doll Revolution_ by dropping \"Lost at Sea,\" \"Song for a Good Son,\" and \"Between the Two.\"  I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to _Doll Revolution_. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"I have been a Deftones fan since the early days and I see many reviewers wanting or expecting them to sound metal or very hard. Deftones were considered nu-metal with their debut and even \"Around the Fur\" but they are a very ahead of the curve band in general. To me, there is no bad Deftones album, \"Gore\" is an excellent album and delivered for me. \"Koi No Ykan\" was a hard album to follow-up because of how great it was and how versatile the sound was on it but \"gore\" doesn't try to out-do that album and that's a good thing because it's a different type of album. You can definitely hear Chino's Cure influence but there's almost a new sound created for the band at times with their new guitarist that fits the make-up of their composing process. I love Chi and hope he comes out to rejoin the guy but I have to give credit where it's do. \"Gore\" does have a couple headbanging songs but it is also wonderful in how it uses synths and experimentation. This for me is above their self titled one and \"Diamond Eyes\" in that it's consistent.  Deftones need to own this and rock fans should sample it. Grade A-","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"So there's fourteen songs to this one, and since there's nothing except for a certain independent attitude and the same label uniting them-- quality varies a lot. Of course this is to my taste, and a lot of people will disagree. This is what you're in for:\n\n1. \"Horses Warriors\" by Radar Brothers (often known as Radar Bros.) [3\/5]\nThis is a mellow, jangly folk rock tune that reminds me a bit of Fleet Foxes. It seems overdone to me, with strings and other background material overwhelming the core of the song. The vocals also sound whiny and otherwise unappealing to me. Not a bad song... but not that good either...\n\n2. \"I Won't Lie to You\" by Let's Wrestle [5\/5]\nNow this is a fun tune. It's a loose kind of tune with a pop punk and garage rock style. Think of early 70s punk such as the Jam, Buzzcocks, and the Automatics. This one is messy, sloppy, and pretty catchy.\n\n3. \"The Very Modern Dance\" by Destroyer [4\/5]\nThis is a piano centered indie pop tune with deliciously sarcastic and whimsical vocals. It reminds me a bit of the Rocky Horror Picture show-- show-tunes with a spiked twist. The energetic piano playing near the end of the song is particularly nice.\n\n4. \"Fall Hard\" by Shout Out Louds [5\/5]\nThis is a pretty solid pop rock tune. Although the lyrics are pretty generic, the vocals have this begging sincerity to them. The guitars have this surf-rock-ish vibe that gives somewhat of a 60s feel to me. Overall, I like the mellow, dreamy feel to this one.\n\n5. \"Written In Reverse\" by Spoon [5\/5]\nSpoon has a strong fanbase (I'm not a fan myself) that will be sure to love this one. On the song's own merits, it's great. Even if you're don't particularly like Spoon, you enjoy the wailing vocals, pounding piano playing, and catchy guitar riffs. The drum work also stands out to me-- love that cymbal pounding! I guess I'd categorize this as 'baroque pop rock'.\n\n6. \"Don't Apologize\" by Lou Barlow [3\/5]\nThis one sounds like pretty generic alternative rock to me. There's a dark, mellow, and fuzzy feeling to the whole thing. The wall of sound-ish chorus picks things up, but otherwise it's just okay.\n\n7. \"Thieves\" by She & Him [5\/5]\nIf you know She & Him, then you know that they keep alive that Brian Wilson style of layering achingly gorgeous melodies upon melodies. This tune is a classic example of their great soulful pop.\n\n8. \"Learned to Surf\" by Superchunk [4\/5]\nThis tune sounds like the generic sort of pop punk that you'd find from Bowling for Soup, Green Day, etc. with pissy sounding vocals and energetic guitars. I like that sort of thing, but I should emphasize the \"generic\" sound of this one. While nice, it's totally forgettable.\n\n9. \"Glide\" by Alec Bathgate [3\/5]\nThis is an upbeat tune with a folk rock feel, but it also has some electronic touches that are nice. However, this one also sounds pretty generic and nondescript for the most part. Just think of \"indie rock singer-songwriter\" and there you are. It's just okay.\n\n10. \"I Wonder Who We Are\" by The Clientele [4\/5]\nThis is an okay pop rock song with some dream pop elements and some horns thrown in. There's a mellow, floating kind of feeling all through it. Still, it comes across as easy listening type music that's forgettable (although you'll want to listen to it again).\n\n11. \"Odessa\" by Caribou [1\/5]\nThis just doesn't go anywhere. It's the only song I deleted after downloading.\n\n12. \"In the Dreamlife U Need a Rubber Soul\" by Clean [5\/5]\nThe group is pretty unknown in the U.S., but they're pretty popular in their native New Zealand. This tune is a simple pop rock song that probably will grow on you. It reminds me of Men at Work and Midnight Oil.\n\n13. \"I Hope You Die\" by Wye Oak [3\/5]\nAs you can tell from the title, this is a dark, sad, and subdued alternative rock tune. I like the subdued nature of this one. The vocals are soft and have a haunting kind of feeling. Yet it doesn't seem that interesting, and I didn't feel after playing it that I would want to hear it again for a while.\n\n14. \"Give It\" by Lambchop [3\/5]\nAlt-country fans will recognize this group immediately. This track is a live performance jam that seems hard if not impossible to categorize in terms of genre and style. It's pretty lively at times, but at 6:28 it drags on and on without particular rhyme or reason. It's sort of like eating appetizer after appetizer expecting a main course but never getting it.\n\nI recommend downloading the album. Eight out of fourteen isn't that bad. But still, if you have a more critical ear than you'll probably end up all but three or four of these tunes.","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"Fiona Joy Hawkins' latest release is a world music album in the truest sense. Not only does it feature musical influences from around the planet, it was also recorded the world over, including Newcastle in Hawkins' native Australia; Los Angeles; New York City; Bremen and Portland, Maine; Halifax, Canada; and co-producer Will Ackerman's Imaginary Road Studios in Vermont.\n\nFeaturing Hawkins playing an Australian Stuart and Sons handmade piano, the CD contains a world-class lineup of session all-stars, including Rebecca Daniel, Eugene Friesen, Tony Levin, Jeff Haynes, Heather Rankin, Marc Shulman, Todd Boston, Paul Jarman, Michael Jackson, Phil Aaberg, and Alfredo Rolando Ortiz, among many others.\n\nAs always, Hawkins maintains her high standards of performance and creativity, with elegant compositions and accomplished playing that brings out their intricate beauty. The other musicians also provide excellent backup and support, without ever overshadowing Hawkins' piano. At the same time, Hawkins gives her cohorts ample space to embellish her vision with their unique, artistic voices. The result is a nice balance between soloing and accompaniment.\n\nThose who appreciate fine, tasteful music, as well as aficionados of piano, can't go wrong with this disc.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"Friday, November 17th 1972 found the Dead playing what would be their only show in Wichita, Kansas at the Century II Convention Hall. This show has circulated for years in less than stellar sound quality but here we FINALLY get it in all of it's remastered and uncut glory. The sound quality is even better than I thought it would be and the performance is a real barn burner.\n\nEverything in the first set has that extra little kick to it and pretty much everything is a standout performance. I would be remiss if I didn't at least mention Sugaree, Me And My Uncle, Tennessee Jed, Black-Throated Wind, Bird Song, Jack Straw, Box Of Rain, Don't Ease Me In and China Cat->Rider.  The second set features great versions of Cumberland Blues, He's Gone and a massive jam of Truckin'->The Other One->Brokedown Palace. To top it all off, there's even a nice bit of filler on here from November 15th at the Oklahoma Music Hall that includes a 30 minute Playing In The Band and Wharf Rat, among others.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"First off, people seem to like down thumbing my reviews as of recently, because I don't immediately jump on the bandwagon and give everything in near sight a 5 star rating. First off, the purpose of a review is to state your opinion on a product and not just gush about how amazing it is, mind you this is coming from someone who will admit to being totally biased because he loves Iron Maiden and they're his favourite band. I ask you, please state why you're thumbs downing my review in the comments, and don't just down thumb it because I didn't give it 5 stars and I apparently hurt you. Do also be wary of my grammar as English is my second language.\n\nI have listened to this album front to back several times. It was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, if the most anticipated for me. I was excited to hear it since it got announced back in July, with 8 days until the Maiden concert I was going to. I have been a huge fan of the band since 2006 and have seen them three times live, own pretty much everything with their namenon it, and regularly listen to \"Seventh Son\" and several other of their albums front to back on a regular basis. I even own every Bruce solo effort, every ASAP and Untouchables album, and H's side project \"Primal Rock Rebellion\"...\n\n...but I just can't get into this album. I really don't know what it is about it. There's very few tracks I'd consider weak, they're almost all pretty good. But, it leaves me feeling cold every time I hear it.\n\nThis Is My God: Dull track. Zero energy and super repetitive. Taylor's vocals aren't as bad as everyone says, he is just fine on this album and at times reminds me of Bono. But this track just bores me. The music video isn't much better, but at least Steve shot the music video in parts of my home province, Alberta. 2\/10\n\nLost Worlds: Not bad. In a way, reminds me a bit of latter-day Rush. I like the lyrics and heavy feel of the tune. The chorus in particular is amazing and manages to add the kick this song needed, in a way. 7\/10\n\nKarma Killer: here's an interesting track. It reminds me of Gods of War, from Bruce's \"Balls to Picasso\" album. It has a heavy feel, and the chorus is very Maiden like. \"Karma killaaaahhh, cannot get enough...\" It's a tad on the repetitive side, but it's fun and catchy. 7\/10\n\nUs Against the World: Decent tune, I'll listen. But put it on a Maiden album and I'd hit the skip button. 6\/10\n\nThe Chosen Ones: This song heavily rips off bands like The Who and Boston, but that's alright, because I just so happen to like both. It carries on for a minute longer than it should and does tend to repeat itself too much. I still like the tune. Very fun and catchy.\n\nA World Without Heaven: this is my favourite track on the album. It wouldn't be out of place on Virtual XI (I like that album a lot, deal with it) and it has an epic feel, the chorus especially still sticks in my head long after the song is done. A great effort, 10\/10\n\nJudas: boring 2\/10\n\nEyes of The Young: not a bad tune. Reminds me a bit of a song you'd hear off of The X Factor. It is a bit too repetitive though, 6\/10\n\nThese Are The Hands: my second favourite tune. It has a nostalgic feel and takes me back to better times, for better or worse. Catchy hook and some epic bass from Steve Harris himself. 7\/10\n\nThe Lesson: Gothic tinged ballad. A good way to close the album on a subdued note, I must say I really dig the strings and violins in the background. 7\/10\n\nFirst off, I guess we should be glad that Arry didn't do what most did when people go off on different tangents, you know how they make inexplicable dubstep music and what not. And thankfully this album is better than that unholy mess, \"Awoken Broken\" by a certain side project by H which shall remain unnamed (sorry H, I really do love you and all, but being in a nu-metal band isn't working out for you), but this album, as I stated above, leaves me feeling empty.\n\nPart of it is because the album didn't have any staying power outside of \"A World Without Heaven\". That's a song I'd willingly put on my iPad and play over and over. After listening to the album, all but the above stated track pretty much went in one ear and out the other. It's not so much the fact that the tracks are bad. Aside from \"This is My God\" and \"Judas\", the tracks don't really stand out.\n\nI don't own a copy of the album, but rather I listened to it 5 times during the listening party on the official Iron Maiden site. And since I own all other things with Arry's namesake, I probably will end up buying it, at least when the price comes down.\n\n***worthwhile, but know what you're getting yourself into first***","classification":3,"fold":2}

{"text":"With the recent passing of Dolores O'Riordan, the lead singer for the Cranberries, I've found myself revisiting this song.  I remember hearing it and loving it in my childhood and teens, and even as an adult it captivated me.  Now, after Dolores' death, it's taken on a melancholy and haunting air, but it nonetheless remains one of my favorite songs.  It marries upbeat instrumentation with wistful lyrics and vocals, somehow weaving a music experience that's at once haunting and lively.\n\nAlways a classic, this song is now a bittersweet listening experience, and well worth purchasing and downloading.","classification":5,"fold":2}

I don't like overly romantic or mushy love songs, and this one manages to be lovely without crossing into embarrassing territory (at least for me).  I always thought it would be a good wedding song.

This is the first of two installments of the Big Great Symphony Box series.  Owning both, I have a few days music to go through.  Good quality sound and good quality performances just like the second.  If you like to have your music categorized by composer, mood, etc... you can do that very easily.

It's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers. After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel, it's still playable but there's one section that got mangled and doesn't quite sound right.

{"text":"It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive.","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"A lot of compiliations end up being good for background music. They are wonderful to listen to and overall very relaxing but not suitable for revving up those energy levels to clean your house, improve your mood or just help you to pick up the pace and become more alert.\n\nIn fact, those reasons are exactly why I went off in search of a good compiliation for those days when I wanted to kick some butt in my day. I found this one and it is perfect! I've been dancing round the house to this as I finish my task list and look forward to using this as my wake-up album of choice in the mornings.

{"text":"Telemann to me represents the finest expression of classical music. You don't have to be a music historian to see, feel and hear the true tonal bliss of Baroque music. Georg Philipp Telemann (14 March 1681  25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. These facts alone will add to the beauty and emotional freedom of his music. I came across Telemann years ago when I started jotting down the names of music I wanted to hear on a rainy weekend morning. I quickly narrowed it down to Baroque music and then when I heard Telemann, I knew I'd found my hero ! !\n\nNow this is coming from a guitarist in whom's musical tastes are about as far from Baroque as you could possibly get. Believe me......... this is the real deal. I only like a few composers. When it comes to personal favorites, I choose string concertos and Telemann's and Vivaldi's top the list ! ! I would also recommend The Brandenburg Concertos, for they create their own spiritual experience of classic British royalty. I hope this helped ! !","classification":5,"fold":2}

Their sound is hilighted by the strong, heavy, and soulful George Ratzlaff vocals, man does this guy have some pipes!!\n\nIncludes mostly faithful covers of Red Rooster, You're No Good and a nice slowed-up cover of The Beatles Lady Madonna. A real bluesy affair, a 70's rock vibe with good guitars. A great listen for fans of Humble Pie, Stones or Faces. The band had three albums so someone at the label obviously recognized some potential.\n\nAlso worthwhile from the 'Lost 70's blues\/psych\/guitar rock' cannon, check out Head Over Heels, Tin House, Stray Dog, Blue Goose, Jeronimo, Black Cat Bones, White Chocolate, Jericho, and the awesome smokin hot guitar album Totty!!!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"When The Ronettes recorded \"Be My Baby,\" they had quite a hit! The song ranked very high on both the Billboard pop (#2) and R&B charts (#4) not long after it was originally released; and you'll know why when you hear it! Even all these years later, this tune remains charming and very sweet--perfect for dancing all alone late at night with your sweetheart in the living room. The Ronettes don't skip a beat, either--they perform this flawlessly and I'm very impressed. The combination of great backup vocalists (which include Darlene Love, Sonny Bono and Cher), the lead vocals by Ronnie Spector and that music with its percussion all combine to produce a magical song that I will never tire of hearing.\n\nThis is something any fan of The Ronettes and\/or Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" music will like; and newcomers to their artistry will enjoy it, too--indeed, Brian Wilson said that \"Be My Baby\" is \"the greatest pop record ever made -- no arguments here.\"\n\nYou won't be able to listen to this just once--this music is all THAT good. Enjoy it!","classification":5,"fold":2}

{"text":"This is a very entertaining album by Bonnie Raitt.  There is a good variety of songs here.  Bonnie is talented enough that she can sing a fast song as well as a slow song  She covers the INXS song from the eighties entitled \"Need You Tonight\" . Bonnie gives this a song a bluesy sound.  I like it a lot.  It sounds so different from the song from the eighties.  I also like the songs \"Unintended Consequence of Love\" and \"Gypsy In Me\".  These two songs are cool and up tempo. I couldn't agree more about the lyrics of \"Unintended Consequences of Love\".  There is humor in the words that I like. \"If You Need Somebody\" is a great song about how a friendship can turn into a romance. There is a slower reflective song entitled \"The Ones We Couldn't Be\". This song features beautiful piano playing. \"Undone\" is a lovely song.  This song makes me think of all of the mistakes I have made in the past. \"All Alone With Something To Say\" is a gem of a  song. This tune reminds me of the work I do in the theater.  I interview people whose stories have never been heard.  I take their stories and develop them into a play for the stage.  The lyrics of this song touches me personally.  I love it when I hear a special song for the first time.  \"Dig In Deep\" is one of Bonnie Raitt's best albums of her career.","classification":5,"fold":2}
